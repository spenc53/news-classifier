Like the Huawei Mate 10 Pro that we reviewed earlier this week, the HTC U11 Plus is a high-spec, high-price flagship phone that’s going to be next to irrelevant in the US because of its lack of availability. But does that make it uninteresting? Not in the slightest.
The U11 Plus has a backstory that could fill an entire book, coming as the result of Google and HTC’s Pixel collaboration, and being the original first-choice candidate for what would ultimately become the Pixel 2 XL made by LG. As the name suggests, this Plus model is also an evolution of the HTC U11, which I personally loved and still rank as one of my favorite phones of 2017. The U11 showed HTC finally getting back on the right track, and when the Plus was announced in November, it just poured more goodies into the offering: bigger battery, bigger 6-inch screen with vastly reduced bezels, and an improved water resistance rating. Plus, of course, a bigger price of €799 / £699 for the European variant I’m reviewing here with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That’s roughly $975, if you’re tempted to go to the trouble of importing one.
With all that pedigree behind it and a laudably fat spec sheet, the HTC U11 Plus was all set to tempt and torment me the way the iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL have been doing lately. But, well, things didn’t turn out as rosy as they initially appeared. The U11 Plus has been a reminder that we should be careful what we wish for.
So what’s my biggest disagreement with the HTC U11 Plus? There’s just too much of it. Weighing 188g, it’s 11 percent heavier than the original U11, which was just comfortable enough to be used like a regular phone with one hand. The U11 Plus is on the wrong side of that fine line, joining devices like the iPhone 8 Plus and Nexus 6P in the awkwardly large and lumpy class of phones. The biggest change is superficially subtle but practically paramount: the U11 has a gorgeous, continuous curve across its entire back, which thins the device toward the outer edges and makes it feel much more compact than it really is. The U11 Plus is basically a fat block with rounded edges.
I’ve long been an advocate for bigger phones with bigger batteries, and that’s exactly what HTC has done with the U11 Plus, but the company has sacrificed the U11’s elegance in this Plus transition. The Mate 10 Pro has a slightly larger battery — 4,000mAh versus the U11 Plus’ 3,930mAh — yet it has a slicker, more desirable design. The Google Pixel 2 XL, which has a 3,520mAh cell, feels much thinner and more refined in the hand than the U11 Plus. Importantly, the Pixel 2 XL has also been an endurance champ in my experience, and the U11 Plus doesn’t offer a tangible improvement — meaning HTC loses out on size, weight, and ergonomics against its most direct rivals without beating them on performance.
There’s shockingly little that I can commend about the HTC U11 Plus’ design. The rear cover is made of highly reflective glass, which might look glamorous and appealing if you only ever handle it with velvet gloves, but in conventional use it’s just a canvas for creating abstract fingerprint art. There’s also a sliver of hollow space under that glass, unfilled by batteries or electronics, which makes it feel flimsy and unreliable. Contrast that with the rock-solid rigidity of the glass-covered iPhone X: the iPhone feels like the $1,000 device that it is, whereas the U11 Plus feels like someone didn’t completely think through the integration of exterior shell and interior components.
On the front, the U11 Plus has HTC’s smallest bezels in a long time. It’s an overdue change for the company, and as such, it’s already behind the curve. These reduced bezels aren’t in the class-leading tier of the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG V30, Essential Phone, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, or the iPhone X. They’re just smaller than before. What makes the change feel unimportant is the bulk of the phone behind it. I still feel like I’m dealing with an unwieldy device, even if it no longer has epic BoomSound speaker bezels. Oh, and that super shiny glass back is a slippery nightmare in the hand. The U11 Plus invokes more bad memories of the U Ultra than happy ones of the U11.
The 6-inch, 18:9 display on the U11 Plus is one of the very few such options on the market that aren’t OLED. It’s Super LCD 6 and, on the strength of this phone’s performance, I have to say Super LCD is just outdated technology now. The display appears lurid, aggressively oversaturated when compared against the Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X. It lacks the sharpness, contrast, and accuracy of OLED rivals. HTC touts that it has a DCI-P3 mode (enabled by default) on the U11 Plus for improved color accuracy, but that’s sadly nonsense. My eyeballs feel seared by the overwhelming pinkness of what’s supposed to be red in the Gmail app. This display also lacks the viewing angles of OLED, the importance of which you’ll appreciate any time you use your U11 Plus while it’s lying on a desk and everything looks darker and less accurate.
The best OLED screens of today allow manufacturers to do things that the old LCD panels are incapable of. Google, Motorola, LG, Samsung, and many other Android vendors now sell phones with always-on displays that keep the time, notifications, and upcoming events constantly on the screen. That’s only possible with OLED. If you want a fingerprint sensor integrated into the display, which was one of the highlights of this year’s CES, you’ll only be able to do it with OLED. In this category, HTC is once again outmatched.
The one redeeming quality that could make this phone worth buying is its camera. The U11 Plus camera is a clear step above any and every phone not made by Google. Yes, that includes the iPhone X. There should be no surprises about this fact, because the camera system is lifted directly out of the superb U11, so for the full breakdown of its performance, I shall point you to our HTC U11 review.
In my own comparisons between the HTC U11 Plus and Pixel 2 XL, which involved a lot of zoomed-in pixel peeping, I scored five wins for the HTC phone, six for the Google device, and six ties. It was obvious that Google’s Pixel camera trumps absolutely everyone in low-light photography, but there were a number of occasions where the U11 Plus took the sharper photo and processed the image more intelligently. On the basis of this comparison, I’m almost sure that HTC’s cameras benefit from some of the same algorithmic magic that goes into Google’s Pixel cameras. Google hardware senior vice president Rick Osterloh seemed to suggest as much in an interview with Wired:
“Last year, [HTC] helped us build Pixel, and then a few months later, they shipped the U11, and that phone had the best smartphone camera in the industry.”
The other U11 Plus redeemer is supposed to be its battery. That’s why I’m out here sweating under the burden of this phone’s girth and bulk. But that battery is a very mixed affair. If I don’t turn on the screen, I can grow a beard in the time it takes to tick down a single percentage point. But once I start using the phone, the battery dwindles down surprisingly quickly. The display and camera really sap the life out of the U11 Plus, leaving me feeling flatly underwhelmed. The problem here isn’t that the battery life is bad, it’s that it’s not noticeably superior to slimmer, cheaper, or smaller phones.
As to the actual use of the U11 Plus, I have to reiterate that the display’s color inaccuracy continued to bug me, though it was occasionally overshadowed by the nagging and intrusive bloatware that HTC lades this phone with. Did you know that women are interested in men’s finances? Apparently scientists have confirmed that, according to a random vibrating notification I got from News Republic. This app, along with Facebook apps, and a number of HTC’s own duplicates of Google services, is not removable from the phone. Also, the TouchPal keyboard preloaded on the U11 Plus is utter, unforgivable garbage. Its haptic feedback is junk, its layout is trash, and it leaves me feeling enervated before I’ve even set up the phone. The original U11 shared these flaws, but I was able to overlook them due to its other strengths, including the pretty design.
I’m glad to see HTC shipping the U11 Plus with Android Oreo already loaded up. Even today, many months after Google released its latest operating system, Android vendors continue selling phones with older versions. HTC does the right thing by keeping most of the default Android interface intact, though it also provides its own theme store (which isn’t very good) and it serves up a Sense Companion that, again, tries to duplicate Google Assistant. Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa are both also ready to use on this phone, which is a nice bit of inclusiveness on HTC’s part.
All-around performance on the U11 Plus is fast, fluid, and reliable. If you’re persistent enough, you can certainly add your own launcher, Google’s Gboard, and a number of other tweaks to make using this phone feel tolerable. But that’s an Android advantage rather than an HTC one. HTC hasn’t really taken any opportunity to distinguish itself with its own software know-how; the so-called Active Edge squeeze gimmick is back from the U11, and while it can be deployed to do more now, it still remains a gimmick.
Audio has traditionally been an HTC strength, and the U11 Plus keeps that heritage going. Its dual speaker system provides rich and full tones, rendering voices in a natural and realistic fashion. I’m especially conscious of how voices sound on phone speakers these days, because of how much podcast listening I do and the related possibility of having to carry out a call on the loudspeaker. Without a headphone jack on the U11 Plus, HTC bundles the same pair of USB-C earphones that we already liked with the U11. Once again, they’re incompatible with anything other than HTC’s gear.
Everything was set up for me to love the U11 Plus that little bit more than I did the U11. But what HTC has demonstrated with this phone is that sometimes — perhaps more often than not in the mobile industry — giving people more isn’t necessarily going to make them happier. It’s the same issue that Samsung and LG long suffered from, this desire to maximize specs and numbers at any cost. The U11 Plus might find its audience in dedicated spec or camera geeks, but for me it’s too unrefined, too bloated (both physically and in its software) and, as a result, too expensive to recommend.

Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump, after listening to a series of emotional stories and pleas to enhance school safety at the White House Wednesday, floated the idea of arming teachers and school staff, an idea that was met with support from many of the attendees. 
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!Full Listening Session: https://t.co/x5VenyQX5p pic.twitter.com/CAPfX5odIp

President Trump on Thursday doubled down on his idea of arming some teachers as a deterrent for school shootings and praised the top leadership of the National Rifle Association as “Great American Patriots.”
In morning tweets and later in a “listening session” at the White House, Trump claimed the strategy of arming teachers would be far less costly than hiring guards. He said “gun-free” school zones make it like “going in for ice cream” for school shooters and said on Twitter that with his strategy, “ATTACKS WOULD END!”
His remarks amplified a strategy Trump pushed during a first “listening session” Wednesday at the White House, which included relatives of some of the 17 people killed by a gunman last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida. Thursday's session included law enforcement officers and other officials.
[ ‘Fix it’: Students and parents tell Trump he needs to address gun violence at schools ]
“Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive,” Trump said in one morning tweet.
During the “listening session” a couple of hours later, Trump said he wants “my schools protected just like I want my banks protected.”
The strategy of arming teachers has many critics, including some law enforcement officers and the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers lobby. In a statement Wednesday, NEA president Lily Eskelsen García said, “Educators need to be focused on teaching our students.”
In his tweets, Trump claimed his strategy had been mischaracterized by some news outlets and is more nuanced than reported. He said he envisioned only about 20 percent of teachers having concealed weapons and said they would have “military or special training experience.”
“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school,” Trump said. “Cowards won’t go there ... problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!”
Some criminologists have questioned that reasoning, pointing out that some people who plan to commit mass shootings are prepared to die in the process.
In a later tweet, Trump praised NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and executive director Chris W. Cox, whose organization has advocated not overreacting to last week's shooting.
“What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,” Trump wrote. “They love our Country and will do the right thing.”
“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump added.
In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump has publicly and privately floated actions that would be at odds with the positions of the NRA, one of his biggest supporters in the 2016 campaign.
In a separate tweet Thursday, Trump appeared to highlight one of those conflicts: raising the age for purchasing assault rifles from 18 to 21.
“I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!” Trump said in the tweet. “Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue — I hope!”
In a statement this week, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker noted that federal law prohibits anyone younger than 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed firearms dealer.
“Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,” Baker said.
Trump said during Friday's listening session that he thought the NRA would support raising the age to 21.
“I don't think I'll be going up against them. ... They're good people,” said Trump, who also praised the organization more broadly. “The NRA is ready to do things. People like to blame them.”
Vice President Pence did not mention increasing the minimum age as he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, which is being held in the Washington area this week.
Instead, Pence pointed to Trump's call for members of Congress to “strengthen background checks” and for the Justice Department to expedite new regulations for “bump stocks,” devices that can convert a legal semiautomatic weapon into one that fires like a fully automatic one.
Pence said “the safety of our nation's schools and our students” is a top national priority, and the administration wants to provide law enforcement and American families “the tools they need to deal with those struggling with dangerous mental illness.”
Earlier this week, Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations to ban bump stocks and other devices that turn semiautomatic firearms into “machine guns.” A bump stock was used by the shooter who opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas in October, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds of others. That massacre immediately prompted calls for lawmakers or the administration to ban such devices through legislation or regulations, but efforts to pass a ban stalled in Congress.
In an appearance Thursday morning on Fox News, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said none of the ideas floated during Thursday’s meeting has been finalized and she criticized reports focusing on arming teachers.
“To focus on that alone today is disingenuously covering the fuller discussion yesterday, and frankly, it’s disrespectful to the people who were in that room raising any number of different issues,” Conway said.
I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
A Washington Post-ABC poll published this week found that 51 percent of Americans said the school shooting in Parkland “could not have been prevented” by allowing schoolteachers to carry guns, while 42 percent said it could have been prevented.
A larger majority, 58 percent, said stricter gun-control laws could have prevented the event, and 77 percent said better mental health screening and treatment could have thwarted it.
Trump has offered no details on how a program of arming teachers would work, how much it would cost and how school districts already strapped for cash would fund it. The Education Department estimates there are 3.1 million public school teachers and 400,000 private-school teachers. Arming 20 percent of teachers would mean arming more than 700,000 people. (There were about 1.3 million active-duty U.S. military personnel in 2016.)
In Thursday's listening session, Trump called his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, a “tough cookie” and told participants that if Kelly were his teacher, he would want Kelly to have a gun.
Speaking to reporters afterward, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R), one of the participants, said there is a need for more protection of students in schools.
“If teachers are armed … they must be highly trained, highly qualified or acting like air marshals, in a capacity like that — former police, former military, coming in in some capacity like that, where they are extremely qualified,” Bondi said. “Not just giving every teacher in school a handgun to carry. I don’t believe that’s going to happen. I don’t think anyone wants that to happen.”
The idea of arming teachers is not a new one for Trump, who often responds to mass shootings by proposing an increase in the number of law-abiding citizens who carry firearms and can stop a shooter.
In July 2015, following a shooting at a military recruitment center in Tennessee that left four Marines dead, Trump tweeted in all caps: “MILITARY LIVES MATTER! END GUN FREE ZONES! OUR SOLDIERS MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES! THIS HAS TO STOP!”
In November 2015, after terrorist attacks in and near Paris that left 130 people dead, Trump criticized the city for having “the toughest gun laws in the world.”
“Nobody had guns but the bad guys. Nobody had guns. Nobody,” Trump said at the time at a campaign rally.
In December 2015, after a mass shooting in Southern California that left 14 dead, Trump told reporters in Iowa the victims of the shooting “could've protected themselves if they had guns.”
“If you look at what happened in California, they didn't have guns, and they were slaughtered,” Trump said.
In January 2016, Trump said at a campaign rally in Vermont that he wants to eliminate gun-free zones at schools.
“I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases,” Trump said, to scattered cheers. “My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.”
In June 2016, after a mass shooting at a Florida nightclub, Trump said, “It's too bad some of the people killed over the weekend didn’t have guns attached to their hips, where bullets could have thrown in the opposite direction.” He said “had people been able to fire back, it would have been a much different outcome.”
“If some of those wonderful people had guns strapped right here — right to their waist or right to their ankle — and one of the people in that room happened to have it and goes 'boom, boom,' you know, that would have been a beautiful sight, folks,” Trump said in a radio interview at the time.
At the time, even leaders of the NRA said arming drunk clubgoers was a bad idea. Trump then clarified his comment and said he “was obviously talking about additional guards or employees.”", politics

Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House.
WASHINGTON — An anguished father mourning his 18-year-old daughter vented his anger and pleaded for safer schools.
A fear-stricken student who watched classmates die last week wept openly as he called for banning assault weapons.
A mother who lost her 6-year-old son in a school shooting just over five years ago warned that more parents would lose their children if President Trump did not act, adding, “Don’t let that happen on your watch.”
One by one at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, survivors of school shootings and family members of victims shared their stories and their calls to action. The extraordinary public exchange with the president gave voice to an intensely emotional debate over how to respond to the latest gun massacre in an American school.

A week after a gunman opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and prompting a rash of student-driven lobbying for new gun restrictions, Mr. Trump met for more than an hour with grieving people in search of solutions. News cameras captured the unusual listening session, revealing an emotional give-and-take between a president and private citizens that is typically shielded from public view.

Mr. Trump used the event to pitch his own ideas about how to prevent such debacles in the future, polling the group about whether they supported allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons, an idea he said could have halted the carnage in Parkland.
“That coach was very brave, saved a lot of lives, I suspect,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to Aaron Feis, a coach at Stoneman Douglas who reportedly died using his body as a shield to protect students. “But if he had a firearm, he wouldn’t have had to run, he would have shot and that would have been the end of it.”
At a listening session with grieving parents and school-shooting victims, including students from Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, President Trump suggested teachers should be allowed to carry firearms.
Mr. Trump said he would press to strengthen background checks for people buying guns and press for enhanced mental health measures. “We’re going to go very strongly into age — age of purchase,” he added, appearing to refer to a proposal to set an age threshold for buying certain weapons, including the AR-15.
But in a session that began as a subdued conversation and sometimes descended into tears and shouting, policy proposals were overshadowed by raw expressions of fear, anger and sorrow.
“We’re here because my daughter has no voice — she was murdered last week, and she was taken from us, shot nine times,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was one of the 17 killed in Parkland. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here, with this administration and me, because I’m not going to sleep until it’s fixed.”
Most of the students and parents invited from the Florida school appeared to support Mr. Trump, many of them prefacing their comments with praise for his leadership. But even fans of the president vented anger and desperation, laying the challenge of responding to the tragedy at his feet.
“It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it — and I’m pissed,” said Mr. Pollack, the only parent of a child killed in Parkland who was at the session, raising his voice as he looked at Mr. Trump. “Because my daughter, I’m not going to see again.”

Samuel Zeif, 18, told of texting his parents and brothers from the second floor of Stoneman Douglas, believing that he would be killed, and he dissolved into tears as he begged the president, “Let’s never let this happen again — please, please.”
“I don’t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an A-R,” Mr. Zeif said, referring to the AR-15 rifle. “How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How do we not stop this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening.”
Mr. Trump, who has often struggled to express empathy in the face of tragedy, appeared moved by the personal stories, even as he asked repeatedly whether anyone in the ornate room at the White House knew how such horrors could be prevented.
“I know you’ve been through a lot — most of you have been through a lot more than you ever thought possible,” Mr. Trump said, seated in a circle with students and parents. “All I can say is that we’re fighting hard for you, and we will not stop.”
“I grieve for you,” Mr. Trump added. “To me, there could be nothing worse than what you’ve gone through.”
During the session, Mr. Trump held a card that appeared to remind him of the basics of compassion when dealing with grieving survivors. “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” read one handwritten note on the card, captured in photographs of the event. “I hear you,” read another.
Mr. Pollack said he did not favor adopting new gun restrictions, but pleaded for Democrats and Republicans to come together to create new school safety measures.
“It’s not about gun laws right now — that’s another fight, another battle,” he said. “We need our children safe.”

Yet the subtext of the discussion was a contentious debate over gun restrictions and an all-too-familiar cycle of outrage, activism and promises of action, and then the inevitable inertia of Washington because of the opposition by the National Rifle Association and its allies.

Mr. Trump, a strident defender of gun rights who ran for office with the strong backing of the N.R.A., has come under immense pressure to endorse new gun limits after the Parkland massacre. The mass shooting has prompted a wave of youth activism that has reverberated from South Florida to Washington, where hundreds of students gathered outside the White House gates on Wednesday before the listening session, chanting, “Enough is enough!” and, “Hands up! — Don’t shoot!”
Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, said it was futile to believe Congress would act on new policies.
“We tried this legislative approach,” said Mr. Barden, a founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit advocacy group created after the massacre. “I’ve been in this building before many times, wringing our hands, pleading with legislators — ‘What can we do?’ — until we finally said we have to go home and do this ourselves.”
He and Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook, pressed Mr. Trump to consider prevention programs that train schools and educators to identify students in crisis and intervene before they attempt to harm themselves or others.
“Rather than arm them with a firearm,” Ms. Hockley said of teachers, “I would rather arm them with the knowledge of how to prevent these acts from happening in the first place.”
One of Mr. Pollack’s sons, Hunter, said he would prefer that educators carried weapons, arguing that more firearms on campus would lead to safer schools.
Yet it was the emotional appeals that appeared to have more influence on Mr. Trump.
Mr. Barden pulled out a photograph of his son showing a gaptoothed grin.
Mr. Pollack spoke movingly of “my beautiful daughter I’m never going to see again.”
Ms. Hockley implored the president not to allow another massacre of children on his watch, saying: “Consider your own children. You don’t want to be me — no parent does.”

As he ended the session, Mr. Trump promised their stories would not go unheard or unaddressed.
“Thank you for pouring out your hearts,” he said. “Because the world is watching, and we’re going to come up with a solution.”

        ""articleBody"": ""The Trump administration is pushing forward with a colossal public works project in Northern California — heightening the towering Shasta Dam the equivalent of nearly two stories.The problem is that California is dead-set against the plan, and state law prohibits the 602-foot New Deal-era structure from getting any taller.But in these times of unprecedented tension between Washington and California, the state&#039;s objection to this $1.3-billion project near the Sacramento River is hardly proving a deterrent. The Trump administration is pursuing the project with gusto, even as it seeks to make deep cuts in popular conservation programs aimed at California&#039;s water shortages.The project promises a big payoff for water interests with close ties to the administration. A former lobbyist for one of the biggest of those interests, the politically connected Westlands Water District, holds a key administration post with power over the flow of federal money.And to ease the project&#039;s path, senior Republican members of Congress, led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, are maneuvering to slip an amendment into a must-pass budget bill this month without hearings or other public scrutiny. The measure would ensure that Westlands, which would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a heightened dam, would not be required to help pay for it. McCarthy says such projects that increase the state&#039;s water storage capacity are &#034;absolutely critical.&#034;The sudden momentum behind heightening the dam — a plan the federal government only a few years ago put on the shelf amid concerns it was incompatible with state environmental laws — threatens to trigger a constitutional conflict that tests the state&#039;s authority over what gets built on federal land within its borders.&#034;Under California law, this is an illegal project,&#034; said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael). &#034;The Trump administration would have to abrogate a century of federal deference to state laws on California water to go ahead with this.&#034;California Natural Resources Secretary John Laird wrote to congressional leaders this week, urging them to reject the Trump administration&#039;s plan to spend $20 million in 2019 on design and other &#034;preconstruction&#034; activities at Shasta Dam.&#034;The Shasta Dam enlargement project would inundate several miles of the protected McCloud River in violation of state law,&#034; Laird wrote. The McCloud is among the pristine California waters protected by the 1972 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which prohibits the state from supporting any projects that disturb such rivers.The dam-heightening proposal has been bitterly fought in California for decades. The Central Valley farms served by Westlands are eager for the tens of thousands of acre-feet of water it could generate for their land. The farms, many of which grow water-intensive crops such as almonds, are among the first water users to see their allocations reduced in times of drought or when water is redirected to preserve the habitat of threatened and endangered species. They are in a long-running dispute with the government over the amount of water they are entitled to receive.&#034;Investing in new infrastructure at Shasta will create a needed and significant new water supply for California&#039;s families, farmers, cities and environmental resources,&#034; said Marlon Duke, a spokesman at the Bureau of Reclamation, the division of the Interior Department overseeing the construction push. He acknowledged that California&#039;s law may prohibit allocation of state money to fund the dam, but said the bureau planned to move ahead.In the middle of this dispute is David Bernhardt, the former Westlands lobbyist who is now the No. 2 official at the Interior Department.His appointment was forcefully opposed last year by conservationists and Democrats, who argued Bernhardt has big conflicts of interest for too many matters before the department. In accepting the post, Bernhardt said he would relinquish his law firm partnership to guarantee he would not financially benefit from any of his actions in Washington.But his critics are unsatisfied. &#034;He&#039;s the poster child of this special-interest revolving door between Interior and Westlands,&#034; Huffman said of Bernhardt, who returned to work at the law firm representing Westlands after his last tour as a high-ranking Interior Department official during the George W. Bush administration. Once Bernhardt leaves his latest government job, &#034;he will walk back out the door to a very lucrative payday,&#034; Huffman said.Bernhardt did not respond to a request for comment. The Interior Department said in a statement that its ethics officers had reviewed Bernhardt&#039;s agreement with the department and advised that it does not require his recusal from decisions on Shasta Dam.Whether the Trump administration would ultimately be able to pour concrete without buy-in from Sacramento remains to be seen. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act could prevent California from issuing any of the permits required for building. Water experts interviewed said they could think of no time in recent history that the federal government moved forward with such a mammoth public works project inside California&#039;s borders without the state&#039;s blessing.Yet the Trump administration has shown itself willing to break with such conventions. &#034;We&#039;ve seen a strong willingness by this administration to disregard or try to overturn state law in a number of circumstances,&#034; said Doug Obegi, a water attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. &#034;This is a case of them wanting to preempt state law so they can flood a Wild and Scenic River for their project.&#034;Environmentalists and fishing industry groups say federal findings that some wildlife could benefit from the project are undermined by government scientific studies showing it would create serious problems, particularly for salmon. The Golden Gate Salmon Assn. is among the groups rallying against a bigger Shasta Dam.The project is also staunchly opposed by the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, which already suffered the destruction of most of its land, including homes and ancient burial sites, when the dam was completed in the 1940s. A raising of the dam, tribe officials say, would inundate much of the sacred ground it has left.But Westlands has gained the support of some prominent Californians, particularly as periodic droughts have forged bipartisan support for building more water storage in the state. Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein is among those who have championed heightening Shasta Dam in the past. Her office did not respond to questions about the Trump administration plan.&#034;The Bureau of Reclamation has been working on this proposal for decades,&#034; said Tom Birmingham, general manager of Westlands. &#034;Westlands Water District supports efforts by the Department of the Interior and members of the California congressional delegation to move forward.&#034;The growers in the water district are positioned to profit handsomely from a bigger dam. As Bernhardt&#039;s agency pushes for the $20 million to jump-start the project, Westlands&#039; allies in Congress are working to exempt it from a new federal law that requires state agencies to share in the costs.That would help Westlands in two ways. It would allow the project to move forward despite California&#039;s refusal to allocate a single cent toward it. And it would save Westlands from having to honor its offer to cover the required state share; federal taxpayers would front the entire cost.The plan is taking shape in the form of a budget amendment McCarthy is scrambling to tack onto whatever spending package Congress approves next week to avoid another government shutdown.&#034;If we&#039;ve learned nothing else from the past years of catastrophic drought in our state, perhaps we now all agree that increasing storage capacity to capture water during wet years for use in dry years is absolutely critical,&#034; McCarthy said in a statement. &#034;It is my hope that the State of California and my colleagues in the Senate recognize the benefits of enlarging Shasta and will be a constructive partner.&#034;In the case of the state, that is unlikely.McCarthy does, though, have a very willing partner in the Trump administration, even as his push for the federal government to take on the full cost of making the dam taller seems at odds with President Trump&#039;s agenda.Trump has been calling for beneficiaries of big federal projects to use more of their own money to get them built.evan.halper@latimes.com | Twitter: @evanhalpersarah.wire@latimes.com | Twitter: @sarahdwire"",

But in these times of unprecedented tension between Washington and California, the state's objection to this $1.3-billion project near the Sacramento River is hardly proving a deterrent. The Trump administration is pursuing the project with gusto, even as it seeks to make deep cuts in popular conservation programs aimed at California's water shortages.
The project promises a big payoff for water interests with close ties to the administration. A former lobbyist for one of the biggest of those interests, the politically connected Westlands Water District, holds a key administration post with power over the flow of federal money.
And to ease the project's path, senior Republican members of Congress, led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, are maneuvering to slip an amendment into a must-pass budget bill this month without hearings or other public scrutiny. The measure would ensure that Westlands, which would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a heightened dam, would not be required to help pay for it. McCarthy says such projects that increase the state's water storage capacity are ""absolutely critical.""
The sudden momentum behind heightening the dam — a plan the federal government only a few years ago put on the shelf amid concerns it was incompatible with state environmental laws — threatens to trigger a constitutional conflict that tests the state's authority over what gets built on federal land within its borders.
""Under California law, this is an illegal project,"" said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael). ""The Trump administration would have to abrogate a century of federal deference to state laws on California water to go ahead with this.""
California Natural Resources Secretary John Laird wrote to congressional leaders this week, urging them to reject the Trump administration's plan to spend $20 million in 2019 on design and other ""preconstruction"" activities at Shasta Dam.
""The Shasta Dam enlargement project would inundate several miles of the protected McCloud River in violation of state law,"" Laird wrote. The McCloud is among the pristine California waters protected by the 1972 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which prohibits the state from supporting any projects that disturb such rivers.
The dam-heightening proposal has been bitterly fought in California for decades. The Central Valley farms served by Westlands are eager for the tens of thousands of acre-feet of water it could generate for their land. The farms, many of which grow water-intensive crops such as almonds, are among the first water users to see their allocations reduced in times of drought or when water is redirected to preserve the habitat of threatened and endangered species. They are in a long-running dispute with the government over the amount of water they are entitled to receive.
""Investing in new infrastructure at Shasta will create a needed and significant new water supply for California's families, farmers, cities and environmental resources,"" said Marlon Duke, a spokesman at the Bureau of Reclamation, the division of the Interior Department overseeing the construction push. He acknowledged that California's law may prohibit allocation of state money to fund the dam, but said the bureau planned to move ahead.
In the middle of this dispute is David Bernhardt, the former Westlands lobbyist who is now the No. 2 official at the Interior Department.
His appointment was forcefully opposed last year by conservationists and Democrats, who argued Bernhardt has big conflicts of interest for too many matters before the department. In accepting the post, Bernhardt said he would relinquish his law firm partnership to guarantee he would not financially benefit from any of his actions in Washington.
But his critics are unsatisfied. ""He's the poster child of this special-interest revolving door between Interior and Westlands,"" Huffman said of Bernhardt, who returned to work at the law firm representing Westlands after his last tour as a high-ranking Interior Department official during the George W. Bush administration. Once Bernhardt leaves his latest government job, ""he will walk back out the door to a very lucrative payday,"" Huffman said.
Bernhardt did not respond to a request for comment. The Interior Department said in a statement that its ethics officers had reviewed Bernhardt's agreement with the department and advised that it does not require his recusal from decisions on Shasta Dam.
Whether the Trump administration would ultimately be able to pour concrete without buy-in from Sacramento remains to be seen. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act could prevent California from issuing any of the permits required for building. Water experts interviewed said they could think of no time in recent history that the federal government moved forward with such a mammoth public works project inside California's borders without the state's blessing.
Yet the Trump administration has shown itself willing to break with such conventions. ""We've seen a strong willingness by this administration to disregard or try to overturn state law in a number of circumstances,"" said Doug Obegi, a water attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""This is a case of them wanting to preempt state law so they can flood a Wild and Scenic River for their project.""
Environmentalists and fishing industry groups say federal findings that some wildlife could benefit from the project are undermined by government scientific studies showing it would create serious problems, particularly for salmon. The Golden Gate Salmon Assn. is among the groups rallying against a bigger Shasta Dam.
The project is also staunchly opposed by the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, which already suffered the destruction of most of its land, including homes and ancient burial sites, when the dam was completed in the 1940s. A raising of the dam, tribe officials say, would inundate much of the sacred ground it has left.
But Westlands has gained the support of some prominent Californians, particularly as periodic droughts have forged bipartisan support for building more water storage in the state. Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein is among those who have championed heightening Shasta Dam in the past. Her office did not respond to questions about the Trump administration plan.
""The Bureau of Reclamation has been working on this proposal for decades,"" said Tom Birmingham, general manager of Westlands. ""Westlands Water District supports efforts by the Department of the Interior and members of the California congressional delegation to move forward.""
The growers in the water district are positioned to profit handsomely from a bigger dam. As Bernhardt's agency pushes for the $20 million to jump-start the project, Westlands' allies in Congress are working to exempt it from a new federal law that requires state agencies to share in the costs.
That would help Westlands in two ways. It would allow the project to move forward despite California's refusal to allocate a single cent toward it. And it would save Westlands from having to honor its offer to cover the required state share; federal taxpayers would front the entire cost.
The plan is taking shape in the form of a budget amendment McCarthy is scrambling to tack onto whatever spending package Congress approves next week to avoid another government shutdown.
""If we've learned nothing else from the past years of catastrophic drought in our state, perhaps we now all agree that increasing storage capacity to capture water during wet years for use in dry years is absolutely critical,"" McCarthy said in a statement. ""It is my hope that the State of California and my colleagues in the Senate recognize the benefits of enlarging Shasta and will be a constructive partner.""
In the case of the state, that is unlikely.
McCarthy does, though, have a very willing partner in the Trump administration, even as his push for the federal government to take on the full cost of making the dam taller seems at odds with President Trump's agenda.
Trump has been calling for beneficiaries of big federal projects to use more of their own money to get them built.

President Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort has asked a federal judge to dismiss some of the criminal charges he faces, arguing that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III exceeded his legal authority in bringing criminal cases unrelated to the presidential election.
Manafort filed a motion Wednesday night in U.S. District Court in Washington, one of two federal courthouses where he faces trials this year, saying that Mueller's team simply dusted off old allegations related to his lucrative consulting work for the Kremlin-backed government in Ukraine from 2006 to 2014.
Defense lawyer Kevin Downing asked the judge to dismiss charges in Washington because they ""simply have no connection"" to the Trump campaign or to possible coordination between Trump's aides and a Russian hacking and social media effort during the 2016 race, the chief focus of the Mueller probe .
Manafort made similar claims of prosecutorial overreach in a separate civil lawsuit that is pending against the government. But the Justice Department order appointing Mueller last May gave him authority to prosecute ""any matters that arose or arise directly from the investigation,"" not just charges related to the campaign or Russia.
Once a prominent Republican operative and a high-flying international consultant, Manafort faces five criminal counts in Washington and another 18 in Virginia for what prosecutors alleged was a complex scheme to hide tens of millions of dollars from U.S. tax authorities. The charges include conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and tax evasion through 2017.
Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all charges and rejected an offer to have the two cases consolidated in one jurisdiction. He is scheduled to go on trial in July in Alexandria, Va., and in September in Washington.
In an order made public Tuesday, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III found that Manafort was a ""substantial"" flight risk. He ordered him confined to house arrest pending trial.
""Given the nature of the charges against the defendant and the apparent weight of the evidence against him, defendant faces the very real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison,"" Ellis wrote.
Most charges were dropped against Manafort's former business partner and his deputy in the Trump campaign, Richard W. Gates III, after Gates agreed to plead guilty to two counts and to assist the Mueller investigation.
Downing's filing also argued that the charges against Manafort are unfair because he had cooperated with an earlier FBI investigation focused on recovering assets in Ukraine. The court papers said Manafort voluntarily met with prosecutors and FBI agents in July 2014, a year before Trump had announced his candidacy.
""In that interview, Mr Manafort provided a detailed explanation of his activities in the Ukraine, including his frequent contact with a number of previous US ambassadors in Kiev and his efforts to further US objectives in Ukraine on their behalf,"" the motion says. ""But the [Justice Department] did not prosecute Mr Manafort for that conduct.""
The motion says Manafort has been forced into ""a game of criminal procedure whack-a-mole against a special counsel whose massive resources he cannot possibly hope to match.""
Mueller's office said it had no comment in response.

        ""articleBody"": ""Promising to build on the Affordable Care Act, a coalition of influential interest groups announced a new legislative push Thursday for a patchwork of measures that aim to make healthcare in California cheaper and more accessible.Advocates touted a slate of proposals, including expanding Medi-Cal access to adults without legal status and increasing subsidies to those buying insurance on the Covered California exchange, as priorities for this legislative session.&#034;This uniquely Californian campaign seeks not just to protect our progress, but advance an aspirational agenda that is achievable without the need of approval from a hostile federal government,&#034; said Anthony Wright, executive director of the advocacy group Health Access California, at a Capitol news conference.The ability to act independently of the federal government is a key contrast from the single-payer proposal, Senate Bill 562, which has consumed much of Sacramento&#039;s healthcare debate in the last year. That bill would rely on permission from Washington in order to establish a sweeping system that covers all Californians&#039; healthcare costs, including those who would otherwise be on Medicare or Medi-Cal.Single-payer healthcare would take years to develop in California, legislative report says »Wright said he did not see a tension between the approach taken by his coalition, which includes labor unions, community health organizations and immigrant rights groups, and that of single payer proponents.&#034;This is entirely complementary with other efforts that are on different tracks and different timelines,&#034; he said, arguing that success of these incremental measures now could lay the groundwork for single-payer in the future. &#034;If that window of opportunity opens up at the federal level, we will be better positioned if we can get to universal coverage, if we can get to cost controls, if we can get to improvements in these key consumer protections.&#034;The California Nurses Assn., the sponsor of SB 562, praised elements of the package — notably the expansion of Medi-Cal to immigrants who are in the country illegally — but said  its proposal also would have extended healthcare coverage to that population.&#034;Overall, it would be less fragmented to do a comprehensive approach like SB 562 that actually solves the problem without scrambling to push piecemeal legislation, some of which only reinforce the existing profit-focused insurance system,&#034; said Chuck Idelson, spokesman for the nurses&#039; union.Proponents don&#039;t yet have a cost estimate for the proposal but rough estimates would total in the billions of dollars. Wright said they would seek money in the budget but did not rule out proposing new taxes to pay for the proposals.California&#039;s uninsured rate plummeted  from 17.2% in 2013 to 6.8% currently after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Of the remaining 1.8 million Californians uninsured, more than half are immigrants who are in the country illegally.Advocates successfully pushed Gov. Jerry Brown to expand Medi-Cal to children without legal status, but were unsuccessful in an attempt to extend that coverage to young adults last year.&#034;Immigrants are an integral part of our state and shape our neighborhoods, workplaces, schools and communities,&#034; said Cynthia Buiza, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center. &#034;With Health4All, California has an opportunity to remove barriers on healthcare based on immigration status.&#034;The Medi-Cal expansion got an endorsement Thursday from the California Medical Assn., the influential lobbying group for the state&#039;s doctors. The association also backed other components of the plan, including establishing a state-level mandate to purchase insurance to replace the federal requirement repealed last year.The scope of the package touches nearly every aspect of the healthcare system, from health plans to prescription drugs. Some measures are holdovers that were introduced last year, but failed to advance. Other elements are still to be fully fleshed out, including the form of subsidies offered to make insurance on the individual market cheaper, and the possibility of crafting a public option to ensure more options on the Covered California market.Some components of the package include establishing quality assessments for Medi-Cal managed care plans, regulating health plan mergers and maintaining a $250 cap on prescription drug co-pays.Other measures take aim at actions by the federal government that advocates say undermine the Affordable Care Act. One bill would ban the availability of &#034;short-term&#034; insurance plansthat do not have to meet requirements under Obamacare, which have been encouraged by the Trump administration. Another bill would bar work requirements for Medi-Cal, a policy pursued by several other states, including Kentucky, with the blessing of the White House.melanie.mason@latimes.comFollow @melmason on Twitter for the latest on California politics."",

Promising to build on the Affordable Care Act, a coalition of influential interest groups announced a new legislative push Thursday for a patchwork of measures that aim to make healthcare in California cheaper and more accessible.

President Trump's company says it has been turning over documents for months in response to requests from federal investigators looking into Russian election interference and possible coordination with Trump associates.
An attorney for the Trump Organization said in a statement to the Associated Press that the company has been cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation since July 2017. The company has been in routine contact with the prosecutors, turning over documents and regularly discussing the scope of requests, he said.
The company's cooperative posture mirrors that of the White House and the Trump campaign, the attorney said, and combined, they have provided more than a million pages of documents to investigators.
The Trump Organization is an umbrella entity that encompasses hundreds of companies owned by the president through a trust.", politics

        ""articleBody"": ""Hard-liners who want to deport all immigrants living here illegally should visit a California farm at harvest. In fact, that&#039;s especially a good idea for President Trump.The president might learn a thing or two about undocumented farmworkers and the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform by watching, for example, peach picking on a sweltering summer day in the San Joaquin Valley.A crop harvest can&#039;t be postponed until there&#039;s a labor force large enough to handle the job. When it&#039;s ripe, the crop must be gathered or it rots.We all know that, but mostly in an abstract way. We don&#039;t stand in the boots of a farmer worrying at dawn whether enough field hands will show. They&#039;re mostly undocumented and often leery of possible raids by federal immigration agents.&#034;I&#039;ve seen in the Salinas Valley lots of lettuce left in the field because of a lack of work force,&#034; says Jamie Johansson, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation.&#034;There&#039;s definitely a worker shortage,&#034; adds Johansson, who farms olives and citrus in Butte County. &#034;It&#039;s become more difficult over the last 10 years.&#034;That&#039;s true for several reasons, not just Trump&#039;s raids.Illegal immigration has slowed, not only during the Trump presidency but also under Barack Obama&#039;s. There&#039;s an attrition of the labor pool, says Tom Nassif, president and chief executive of the Western Growers Assn.The Mexican economy has been improving and &#034;Mexico itself is importing farmworkers from Central America,&#034; Nassif says. Plus, farmworker parents hold higher ambitions for their children and increasing numbers are going to college — many of them the so-called Dreamers.Moreover, the California economy has greatly improved and there are jobs in construction and restaurants that beat farm work.&#034;It&#039;s getting worse every day,&#034; Nassif says. &#034;We&#039;re seeing shortages of 25% to 40%, depending on the crops and times of year.&#034; Fruit trees and row crops that rely heavily on hand labor are particularly vulnerable, he says.Farmers should pay more, critics charge. But they&#039;re paying $15 to $18 an hour, Johansson says. And citizens can&#039;t be lured at any wage.More from George Skelton »Trump is making California agriculture nervous because of his roundups of undocumented immigrants and newly imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. There&#039;s concern about retaliation by foreign countries against California farm products.Trump was down on the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego on Tuesday ogling huge prototypes of a $25-billion wall designed to keep out immigrants. But in California, farmers are trying to get more of these workers into the country and keep them here.Ironically, Trump&#039;s immigration and tariff policies are creating jitters especially in the California farm belt, which gave the Republican his strongest support in this blue state that voted lopsidedly for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ten Central Valley agriculture counties sided with Trump over Clinton.&#034;They&#039;re culturally Republican, more conservative,&#034; veteran GOP consultant Rob Stutzman says of farm belt voters. &#034;They view the ruling and elite classes in coastal cities differently than they see themselves. It&#039;s a different, harder life in the valley.&#034;There are distant danger signs for Republicans, however, even in the farm belt. Among new voter registrations, only 22% are Republican and 29% are Democrats, according to Paul Mitchell, who heads Political Data Inc. More important, 40% are independent, shunning both parties, and 43% are Latino.Economics professor Daniel Sumner, who heads the UC Davis Agriculture Issues Center, says the biggest immediate problem for California farmers with Trump&#039;s immigration and tariff policies is uncertainty.&#034;The rhetoric makes people nervous,&#034; Sumner says. &#034;Workers may leave California for places they feel are safer, like in the Midwest.&#034;Coverage of California politics »The 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminum not only may spur foreign retaliation against California&#039;s $25 billion worth of annual agriculture exports, but will probably raise prices on farm machinery, Sumner adds.&#034;A tomato harvester is made of steel,&#034; the agriculture economist says. &#034;You may have an old one wrapped in bailing wire and are planning to buy a new one that costs $300,000. Then you find out it&#039;s going to be $320,000. That means one piece of expensive equipment doesn&#039;t get sold. And the whole economy operates less efficiently.&#034;Trump has exempted Canada and Mexico from the steel tariffs, at least initially. Sumner wouldn&#039;t be surprised if he doesn&#039;t soften the tariffs further when countries start to retaliate.&#034;Almost never does a president say, &#039;Gee, I was wrong. You win. You&#039;re tougher than I am,&#039;&#034; he says. (And certainly not Trump.) &#034;What they do say is, &#039;We achieved our objective.&#039; And that may well happen here.&#034;But even if Trump ultimately backs down, California agriculture could be hurt in the meantime.&#034;These things have consequences,&#034; Sumner says. &#034;People start buying from somewhere else. That can happen just with rhetoric, and that&#039;s the worry.&#034;California agriculture is looking for legislation that will provide legal documentation for current workers and &#034;bring them out of the shadows,&#034; Johansson says.But that&#039;s seen as amnesty by many hard-liners and is politically toxic.&#034;I see it as common decency,&#034; Nassif says. &#034;There&#039;s no question the vast majority of field workers are falsely documented.

Hard-liners who want to deport all immigrants living here illegally should visit a California farm at harvest. In fact, that's especially a good idea for President Trump.
The president might learn a thing or two about undocumented farmworkers and the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform by watching, for example, peach picking on a sweltering summer day in the San Joaquin Valley.
A crop harvest can't be postponed until there's a labor force large enough to handle the job. When it's ripe, the crop must be gathered or it rots.
We all know that, but mostly in an abstract way. We don't stand in the boots of a farmer worrying at dawn whether enough field hands will show. They're mostly undocumented and often leery of possible raids by federal immigration agents.
""I've seen in the Salinas Valley lots of lettuce left in the field because of a lack of work force,"" says Jamie Johansson, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation.
""There's definitely a worker shortage,"" adds Johansson, who farms olives and citrus in Butte County. ""It's become more difficult over the last 10 years.""
That's true for several reasons, not just Trump's raids.
Illegal immigration has slowed, not only during the Trump presidency but also under Barack Obama's. There's an attrition of the labor pool, says Tom Nassif, president and chief executive of the Western Growers Assn.
The Mexican economy has been improving and ""Mexico itself is importing farmworkers from Central America,"" Nassif says. Plus, farmworker parents hold higher ambitions for their children and increasing numbers are going to college — many of them the so-called Dreamers.
Moreover, the California economy has greatly improved and there are jobs in construction and restaurants that beat farm work.
""It's getting worse every day,"" Nassif says. ""We're seeing shortages of 25% to 40%, depending on the crops and times of year."" Fruit trees and row crops that rely heavily on hand labor are particularly vulnerable, he says.
Farmers should pay more, critics charge. But they're paying $15 to $18 an hour, Johansson says. And citizens can't be lured at any wage.

Trump is making California agriculture nervous because of his roundups of undocumented immigrants and newly imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. There's concern about retaliation by foreign countries against California farm products.
Trump was down on the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego on Tuesday ogling huge prototypes of a $25-billion wall designed to keep out immigrants. But in California, farmers are trying to get more of these workers into the country and keep them here.
Ironically, Trump's immigration and tariff policies are creating jitters especially in the California farm belt, which gave the Republican his strongest support in this blue state that voted lopsidedly for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ten Central Valley agriculture counties sided with Trump over Clinton.
""They're culturally Republican, more conservative,"" veteran GOP consultant Rob Stutzman says of farm belt voters. ""They view the ruling and elite classes in coastal cities differently than they see themselves. It's a different, harder life in the valley.""
There are distant danger signs for Republicans, however, even in the farm belt. Among new voter registrations, only 22% are Republican and 29% are Democrats, according to Paul Mitchell, who heads Political Data Inc. More important, 40% are independent, shunning both parties, and 43% are Latino.
Economics professor Daniel Sumner, who heads the UC Davis Agriculture Issues Center, says the biggest immediate problem for California farmers with Trump's immigration and tariff policies is uncertainty.
""The rhetoric makes people nervous,"" Sumner says. ""Workers may leave California for places they feel are safer, like in the Midwest.""
Coverage of California politics »
The 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminum not only may spur foreign retaliation against California's $25 billion worth of annual agriculture exports, but will probably raise prices on farm machinery, Sumner adds.
""A tomato harvester is made of steel,"" the agriculture economist says. ""You may have an old one wrapped in bailing wire and are planning to buy a new one that costs $300,000. Then you find out it's going to be $320,000. That means one piece of expensive equipment doesn't get sold. And the whole economy operates less efficiently.""
Trump has exempted Canada and Mexico from the steel tariffs, at least initially. Sumner wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't soften the tariffs further when countries start to retaliate.
""Almost never does a president say, 'Gee, I was wrong. You win. You're tougher than I am,'"" he says. (And certainly not Trump.) ""What they do say is, 'We achieved our objective.' And that may well happen here.""
But even if Trump ultimately backs down, California agriculture could be hurt in the meantime.
""These things have consequences,"" Sumner says. ""People start buying from somewhere else. That can happen just with rhetoric, and that's the worry.""
California agriculture is looking for legislation that will provide legal documentation for current workers and ""bring them out of the shadows,"" Johansson says.
But that's seen as amnesty by many hard-liners and is politically toxic.
""I see it as common decency,"" Nassif says. ""There's no question the vast majority of field workers are falsely documented. I'd say of 500,000 farmworkers in the state, 70% are falsely documented.""
Falsely documented is a polite word for phony papers. Give them real ones.
Trump should book an August educational tour of dusty Central Valley farm fields. And leave his immigration agents at home.

        ""articleBody"": ""Can you guess which Southern California city has a John Wayne Day on the birthday of the late actor and staunch conservative?Clue: It&#039;s the same city that has a statue of former President Ronald Reagan.You&#039;re disqualified if you live in Newport Beach, which I visited Tuesday to test the water on how locals feel about President Trump. The president had just arrived at the Mexican border to inspect the prototypes for his big beautiful wall, and he wasn&#039;t on the ground long before he poked a stick in California Gov. Jerry Brown&#039;s eye.&#034;I think Governor Brown has done a very poor job running California,&#034; said Trump, who made a crack about high taxes and said once again that we are &#034;totally out of control&#034; here.I can think of a dozen things I&#039;d like to say about Trump judging anyone else&#039;s job performance, but I&#039;m not going to. California literally rained on Trump&#039;s parade Tuesday, relieving me of the need to mark turf.Instead, I&#039;m going to remind myself that while almost 9 million Californians voted for Hillary Clinton in a blowout, nearly 4.5 million voted for Trump. In Newport Beach, Trump had dissenters. But in most neighborhoods of the affluent community, Trump prevailed by a comfortable margin, even though Clinton won Orange County — which is much bluer than it once was — and became the first Democrat to do so since the Great Depression.On Balboa Island, under skies as gray as the shrunken California Republican Party, I found a 94-year-old gent strolling near the water. Sy Kimball said he once owned a convalescent home where John Wayne&#039;s mother was a resident.Reagan was a good man, Kimball said.I asked what he thought Reagan would make of Trump, and Kimball didn&#039;t have to think for long.&#034;Trump&#039;s more like Reagan than any president we&#039;ve had,&#034; said Kimball, who told me exactly what he likes about the man who currently calls the White House home.&#034;If he says he&#039;s going to do it, he&#039;ll do it,&#034; he said.Well, that&#039;s not true. But Kimball was such a genial guy, I wasn&#039;t going to argue with him.It&#039;s gotta be tough for older Californians to adapt to the kind of changes that have transformed the state. Between 1952 and 1988, Republicans won all but one presidential election. And we used to have Republican governors and statewide office holders rather than Democratic domination, so on tough issues, there was a healthy back and forth.We&#039;re too polarized now, with extreme and inflexible views on both sides of the aisle. President Reagan, for instance, signed a bill that made nearly 3 million illegal immigrants eligible for amnesty, and as governor, he signed an abortion rights bill.Fox News would ridicule and destroy a man like that.So let me repeat the question, this time for Patti Stern, president of the Newport Harbor Republican Women:What would Reagan make of Trump?&#034;I have no idea, and it&#039;s a very different country,&#034; said Stern.She&#039;s right about that. The country is much more diverse, for one thing, and Trump used that as a wedge from the first day of his campaign.Immigration is the &#034;primary topic of discussion this month,&#034; said the February newsletter for Stern&#039;s group. Stern, in her message to members, advocated for Trump&#039;s wall and his immigration policies.&#034;If we elect Republican officials who refuse to acquiesce to the Democrats&#039; kowtowing to their base, many of whom are here illegally and are breaking our laws, it will slow down illegal crossings,&#034; Stern wrote.That same newsletter carried a warning about a report that &#034;millennials are increasingly turning away from capitalism and toward socialism — and even communism as a viable alternative.&#034;Hey, it&#039;s Trump who seems to be in love with Vladimir Putin.

Can you guess which Southern California city has a John Wayne Day on the birthday of the late actor and staunch conservative?
Clue: It's the same city that has a statue of former President Ronald Reagan.
You're disqualified if you live in Newport Beach, which I visited Tuesday to test the water on how locals feel about President Trump. The president had just arrived at the Mexican border to inspect the prototypes for his big beautiful wall, and he wasn't on the ground long before he poked a stick in California Gov. Jerry Brown's eye.
""I think Governor Brown has done a very poor job running California,"" said Trump, who made a crack about high taxes and said once again that we are ""totally out of control"" here.
I can think of a dozen things I'd like to say about Trump judging anyone else's job performance, but I'm not going to. California literally rained on Trump's parade Tuesday, relieving me of the need to mark turf.
Instead, I'm going to remind myself that while almost 9 million Californians voted for Hillary Clinton in a blowout, nearly 4.5 million voted for Trump. In Newport Beach, Trump had dissenters. But in most neighborhoods of the affluent community, Trump prevailed by a comfortable margin, even though Clinton won Orange County — which is much bluer than it once was — and became the first Democrat to do so since the Great Depression.
On Balboa Island, under skies as gray as the shrunken California Republican Party, I found a 94-year-old gent strolling near the water. Sy Kimball said he once owned a convalescent home where John Wayne's mother was a resident.
Reagan was a good man, Kimball said.
I asked what he thought Reagan would make of Trump, and Kimball didn't have to think for long.
""Trump's more like Reagan than any president we've had,"" said Kimball, who told me exactly what he likes about the man who currently calls the White House home.
""If he says he's going to do it, he'll do it,"" he said.
Well, that's not true. But Kimball was such a genial guy, I wasn't going to argue with him.
It's gotta be tough for older Californians to adapt to the kind of changes that have transformed the state. Between 1952 and 1988, Republicans won all but one presidential election. And we used to have Republican governors and statewide office holders rather than Democratic domination, so on tough issues, there was a healthy back and forth.
We're too polarized now, with extreme and inflexible views on both sides of the aisle. President Reagan, for instance, signed a bill that made nearly 3 million illegal immigrants eligible for amnesty, and as governor, he signed an abortion rights bill.
Fox News would ridicule and destroy a man like that.
So let me repeat the question, this time for Patti Stern, president of the Newport Harbor Republican Women:
What would Reagan make of Trump?
""I have no idea, and it's a very different country,"" said Stern.
She's right about that. The country is much more diverse, for one thing, and Trump used that as a wedge from the first day of his campaign.
Immigration is the ""primary topic of discussion this month,"" said the February newsletter for Stern's group. Stern, in her message to members, advocated for Trump's wall and his immigration policies.
""If we elect Republican officials who refuse to acquiesce to the Democrats' kowtowing to their base, many of whom are here illegally and are breaking our laws, it will slow down illegal crossings,"" Stern wrote.
That same newsletter carried a warning about a report that ""millennials are increasingly turning away from capitalism and toward socialism — and even communism as a viable alternative.""
Hey, it's Trump who seems to be in love with Vladimir Putin. Why no mention of that?
On March 22, the Republican Women will host a visit from Juanita Broaddrick, who has alleged that President Bill Clinton raped her in 1977, when he was Arkansas attorney general.
If it's true, there's no defending Clinton.
But what does Stern have to say about allegations against Trump, who was heard on tape talking about how he grabs women, and who has given rise to the career of stripper Stormy Daniels, who says they had an affair?
""I'm not going to be discussing that,"" said Stern.
Getting back to immigration for a moment, I spotted three landscapers working in a Balboa Island yard and asked the crew chief what he thought about Trump's visit.
""It's not good,"" he said, telling me that he and the other two are all undocumented, and the idea of Trump being in the state was a little unsettling.
He didn't want to get in trouble with his boss, but he said he and his buddies get $11 an hour, or $16 if they drive the company truck. Legal residents make a few dollars an hour more, but complaining means losing your job.
California has exploited immigrant labor throughout its history, which is why immigration policy operates on a wink and a nod. Too many people benefit from it, including agri-business, the hospitality industry and homeowners who like cheap goods and low wages, otherwise we would have stopped sending mixed messages long ago.
A couple of miles away, I stopped at a house with an American flag and a sign that said ""Buy American."" I called to see if anyone was home, but there was no answer. A woman named Nancy came by, walking her dog, and when I told her about the landscapers I'd spoken to, she agreed that immigration can be complicated.
That's one reason she and her husband are big supporters. It's an issue crying out for someone to take charge.
Yes, she said, she thinks Trump had an affair with Stormy Daniels and is trying to cover it up, and yes he says stupid things, and yes he has ""issues of moral character.""
But she still likes what she sees.
""As taxpayers, we feel like our economy is going down,"" she said, which is a curious argument from a physical therapist married to a physician and living near the beach in one of the most expensive ZIP Codes in California.
""So many people are here that aren't part of the system. They get free schooling, they get free food.… Somebody has to stand up to them….
""That's basically why we're Trump supporters. We feel like everybody should have to pay their taxes and abide by the law, and it's not fair that our kids, when they apply to schools … a white male has no prayer of getting into any California school because it's all illegals who get first dibs, and then it's out-of-state students.""
Some readers, I'm sure, will cheer those sentiments.
For those who were depressed by them, I met a woman in her 20s two blocks away. She said she and the young people she knows, for the most part, don't hold those views.
The past can't hold.
The future is theirs.", politics

        ""articleBody"": ""He came, he saw, he raised money, he tweeted.And less than 24 hours later, President Trump is headed back East — after leaving Los Angeles smack dab in the middle of the morning commute.Trump&#039;s first visit to California was equal parts bravado and stagecraft, with a dash of campaign fundraising and a few jabs at the Golden State thrown in for good measure.Yes, there&#039;s also huge political news on the other side of the country for him to respond to once he&#039;s back in Washington: a Cabinet member who&#039;s gotten the ax and a too-close-to-call special election in a Pennsylvania House district that&#039;s been solidly Republican for a very long time.Sign up for the Essential Politics newsletter »But let&#039;s start in our own backyard, shall we? After all, our Times team of reporters and photographers were with Trump every step of the way — providing a lively news feed on all of Tuesday&#039;s presidential events.TRUMP TOUTS THE WALLThe unique nature of Trump&#039;s trip to California was evident from the very moment Air Force One landed near San Diego. There was no big welcoming party from state leaders, all Democrats. But even Republicans — both Californian Republicans who are holding office and GOP candidates — were absent from their party leader&#039;s visit.Reps. Duncan Hunter and Darrell Issa were some of the only elected officials or candidates spotted with Trump throughout the day.Not that the president was deterred on a trip primarily for him to get an up-close look at proposals for perhaps the centerpiece of his 2016 election: a massive new wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.And lest anyone think there wouldn&#039;t be anything unexpected during his visit to the site near San Diego where prototypes of new walls have been built, Trump offered a new rationale for the project — one without any proof.&#034;It will save thousands and thousands of lives, save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing crime, drug flow, welfare fraud and burdens on schools and hospitals,&#034; he said. &#034;The wall will save hundreds of billions of dollars — many, many times what it&#039;s going to cost.&#034;Yes, the president offered a little criticism of Gov. Jerry Brown, saying the Democrat is &#034;doing a terrible job&#034; of leading California. (Naturally, Brown responded with a slightly different take on how things are going in the state.)TRUMP&#039;S CASH GRABAfter his speech to Marines at Miramar, the president was off to Beverly Hills for a private fundraising dinner benefiting the Republican National Committee. His hosts for the evening were Edward Glazer, the co-chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and wife Sheri Glazer.It was clear there would be no leaked video of the closed press event. &#034;Absolutely no cell phones,&#034; read a sign outside of the venue.And yes, not everyone in the exclusive gated Beverly Park neighborhood was thrilled with the security impacts of a presidential visit.Trump spent the night at the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Los Angeles&#039; Wilshire Grand Building.THE PROTESTERSThe arrival of a president with a 26% approval rating among California adults in the most recent statewide poll undoubtedly was going to draw protesters, and plenty of people showed up to jeer Trump throughout the day.Near the border, protesters decided to cheer people who were crossing through the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The president&#039;s supporters were outnumbered.(There were protesters on the Mexican side of the border, too.)In Beverly Hills, the scene was as much a party as it was a protest.

He came, he saw, he raised money, he tweeted.
And less than 24 hours later, President Trump is headed back East — after leaving Los Angeles smack dab in the middle of the morning commute.
Trump's first visit to California was equal parts bravado and stagecraft, with a dash of campaign fundraising and a few jabs at the Golden State thrown in for good measure.
Yes, there's also huge political news on the other side of the country for him to respond to once he's back in Washington: a Cabinet member who's gotten the ax and a too-close-to-call special election in a Pennsylvania House district that's been solidly Republican for a very long time.

But let's start in our own backyard, shall we? After all, our Times team of reporters and photographers were with Trump every step of the way — providing a lively news feed on all of Tuesday's presidential events.
TRUMP TOUTS THE WALL
The unique nature of Trump's trip to California was evident from the very moment Air Force One landed near San Diego. There was no big welcoming party from state leaders, all Democrats. But even Republicans — both Californian Republicans who are holding office and GOP candidates — were absent from their party leader's visit.
Reps. Duncan Hunter and Darrell Issa were some of the only elected officials or candidates spotted with Trump throughout the day.
Not that the president was deterred on a trip primarily for him to get an up-close look at proposals for perhaps the centerpiece of his 2016 election: a massive new wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
And lest anyone think there wouldn't be anything unexpected during his visit to the site near San Diego where prototypes of new walls have been built, Trump offered a new rationale for the project — one without any proof.
""It will save thousands and thousands of lives, save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing crime, drug flow, welfare fraud and burdens on schools and hospitals,"" he said. ""The wall will save hundreds of billions of dollars — many, many times what it's going to cost.""
Yes, the president offered a little criticism of Gov. Jerry Brown, saying the Democrat is ""doing a terrible job"" of leading California. (Naturally, Brown responded with a slightly different take on how things are going in the state.)
TRUMP'S CASH GRAB
After his speech to Marines at Miramar, the president was off to Beverly Hills for a private fundraising dinner benefiting the Republican National Committee. His hosts for the evening were Edward Glazer, the co-chairman of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and wife Sheri Glazer.
It was clear there would be no leaked video of the closed press event. ""Absolutely no cell phones,"" read a sign outside of the venue.
And yes, not everyone in the exclusive gated Beverly Park neighborhood was thrilled with the security impacts of a presidential visit.
Trump spent the night at the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Los Angeles' Wilshire Grand Building.
THE PROTESTERS
The arrival of a president with a 26% approval rating among California adults in the most recent statewide poll undoubtedly was going to draw protesters, and plenty of people showed up to jeer Trump throughout the day.
Near the border, protesters decided to cheer people who were crossing through the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The president's supporters were outnumbered.
(There were protesters on the Mexican side of the border, too.)
In Beverly Hills, the scene was as much a party as it was a protest. Street vendors sold hot dogs, a live band played music, and a stage was set up for speakers.
And as many as 300 people were waiting for the nation's 45th president as his motorcade pulled into the downtown L.A. hotel Tuesday night, where their anti-Trump message was displayed in lights.
Be sure to check out the best of Trump's California day in photos. And peruse Trump's history of tweets about California, a list that grew even on the day of the trip.
TILLERSON IS OUT: THE 'REXIT'
For much of the nation, the Trump news of Tuesday that stood out was his decision to fire Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
The long-simmering conflict between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat finally came to a head, as the president confirmed the news via Twitter, about four hours after Tillerson cut short a weeklong trip to Africa and rushed back to Washington. The former CEO of Exxon Mobil will leave his post at month's end.
It is the latest in the long list — one you can see here — of notable departures from an administration that is still just 14 months old.
Once confirmed, the new secretary will be Mike Pompeo, currently serving as CIA director. And in Pompeo, the president gets someone on his ""wavelength"" who has political skills Tillerson lacked. That could help the former Kansas congressman, since foreign governments are likely to view him as speaking directly for Trump on Iran, North Korea and other key issues.
Pompeo's elevation means Trump needs a new CIA director, and he's chosen Deputy Director Gina Haspel, who would be the first woman to run the nation's premier spy agency. But her confirmation hearings may focus more on her role in the agency's torture of terrorism suspects and the destruction of key evidence more than a decade ago.
PENNSYLVANIA'S 18TH: DOWN TO THE WIRE
Everyone who follows politics has an opinion about what happened in the Pennsylvania special election held on Tuesday. The only thing anyone can safely say is that the House seat in play has long been safely ensconced in GOP territory … but not any longer.
Democrat Conor Lamb held on to a razor-thin lead as the night ended, but it was unclear whether it will be enough to hold off state lawmaker Rick Saccone.
Still, many saw it as another example of a troubling trend for Republicans with regular midterm elections right around the corner.
NATIONAL POLITICS LIGHTNING ROUND
-- Is Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin the next one to be shown the door in the Trump White House?
-- A previously withheld video has been released showing the heckling of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin during a recent speech about the economy at UCLA.
-- A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the bulk of Texas' crackdown on ""sanctuary cities"" in a victory for the Trump administration as part of its aggressive fight against measures seen as protecting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.
-- Is the NRA right when it says that Florida's new law raising the age limit on buying guns is unconstitutional?
DEADLINE DAY FOR THE LAST CALIFORNIA HOPEFULS
California election law makes today the last day for candidates to file in races where there's no incumbent. And all eyes are on a pair of Southern California House districts where Democrats think they have a chance to flip the map from red to blue.
That is, if a plethora of Democratic candidates don't split the vote so thinly that Republicans advance to November's election. On Tuesday, Democrat Jay Chen dropped out of the crowded race to replace retiring Rep. Ed Royce. National Democrats praised his decision.
We'll keep a close eye on developments all day on our Essential Politics news feed.
TODAY'S ESSENTIALS
-- Two prominent California Democrats quickly seized on the presidential visit Tuesday in hopes of generating a little buzz.

-- An Irvine-based website that links patients and consumers with marijuana providers has responded to a cease-and-desist letter from state cannabis regulators by arguing it is protected by federal law.
-- A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Francisco resigned his post, disillusioned by what he called falsehoods spread by Trump administration officials after a four-day sweep last month, according to reports.
-- Californians who buy guns or ammunition would have to pay a new fee to fund more counselors and safety officers at schools under a state Assembly bill proposed in response to the recent mass shooting at a Florida high school.
-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has endorsed Republican John Cox in the race for governor.

        ""articleBody"": ""On Sunday, I stood at the end of a barren cul-de-sac overlooking a field on the U.S. side of the border, staring toward Mexico.President Trump&#039;s border wall prototypes were off in the distance, about a mile away. This area — the ironically named &#034;Free Speech Zone&#034; — was as close as the public can get to the prototypes. (If you are on the Mexican side of the border, however, you can get a lot closer.) In anticipation of protests, temporary signs were posted on street poles, prohibiting the possession of firearms, daggers, slingshots, sticks, bats, pepper spray and other &#034;implements of riots.&#034;The 30-foot-tall segments stood out, like Cadillacs stuck in the desert floor. One day, perhaps they will be a reminder of a particularly hysterical American political moment: Trump&#039;s Folly.The wall, which began as a bit of campaign trail hyperbole, is an act of hostility toward Mexico and a sop to Trump&#039;s base. You can argue all you like about the integrity of national borders, but the wall is the physical manifestation of the racism that Trump has so often expressed toward the Mexican people, who, through no fault of their own, are not Norwegian.It is a waste of time, space and money.

On Sunday, I stood at the end of a barren cul-de-sac overlooking a field on the U.S. side of the border, staring toward Mexico.
President Trump's border wall prototypes were off in the distance, about a mile away. This area — the ironically named ""Free Speech Zone"" — was as close as the public can get to the prototypes. (If you are on the Mexican side of the border, however, you can get a lot closer.) In anticipation of protests, temporary signs were posted on street poles, prohibiting the possession of firearms, daggers, slingshots, sticks, bats, pepper spray and other ""implements of riots.""
The 30-foot-tall segments stood out, like Cadillacs stuck in the desert floor. One day, perhaps they will be a reminder of a particularly hysterical American political moment: Trump's Folly.
The wall, which began as a bit of campaign trail hyperbole, is an act of hostility toward Mexico and a sop to Trump's base. You can argue all you like about the integrity of national borders, but the wall is the physical manifestation of the racism that Trump has so often expressed toward the Mexican people, who, through no fault of their own, are not Norwegian.
It is a waste of time, space and money. It also is an affront to the environment.

I understand, though, that the wall is thrilling to people who think the country has suffered from illegal immigration, or feel that people who violate the rules should be punished, even as they put food on your table, build your houses and clean your homes. While I was peering at the prototypes, a few people pulled up next to me to check them out. Most, like an aerospace industry salesman named Don Johnson, approved.
""I think the wall should have happened 30 years ago,"" said Johnson, 52, who lives in Chula Vista. ""I'm a fan of what Donald Trump is trying to do. We need to know who is in our country.""
Baron Partlow, 55, who had arrived with two friends, agreed. “I really welcome President Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ platform,” said Partlow, a loquacious industrial marine painter and environmental activist who lives in Nestor, a residential neighborhood 1.8 miles north of the border. “Any way into the United States needs to be secured, especially in this day and age.”
I found these sorts of comments ironic. There is already a double fence separating this part of California from Mexico. It's 14 miles long, and runs from Otay Mesa into the Pacific Ocean. It's a scar on the land. Walls — or fences — like these create more problems than they solve.
Last week, my colleague Cindy Carcamo wrote a story about a wall that was erected on the U.S.-Mexico border near the town of Jacumba Hot Springs as part of the “Operation Gatekeeper” border fortification and immigration crackdown of the 1990s. The man in charge of that operation, Mark Reed, now retired, told her that the wall had unintended consequences.
In decades past, seasonal workers had been able to cross back and forth with relative ease. But after  President Reagan granted 2.7 million immigrants amnesty in exchange for tighter border security in 1986, the border became less porous and migrant workers were effectively locked inside the U.S. They smuggled their families in, laying the groundwork for later backlashes against illegal immigration.
“Instead of a single man making his way up, now you brought the whole family up and you stayed,”  Reed said. “That didn’t work out too well for us. Now we really created a mess.”
That's right. Bigger wall, bigger mess.
::
The problem with focusing on Trump's pipe dream of a wall is that real border problems that can actually be solved are being ignored.
The Tijuana River, for instance, which crosses the international border before reaching the ocean on the U.S. side, is said to be one of the most polluted waterways in the world. Untreated sewage flows from Mexico into the river valley, fouling the estuary, beaches and surf all the way up to Imperial Beach. For a huge chunk of the year, the water is too polluted to swim in.
As I chatted with Partlow, I  learned that he is the founder of one of several environmental groups fighting to get the U.S. and Mexico to fix the mess. His group has the catchiest name: Stop the Poop. He took me into the Tijuana River Valley to show me how awful the problem is.
A few miles west of Otay Mesa, we visited Smuggler's Gulch and Goat Canyon, just north of the border fence. Both are the site of catch basins that are fetid pools of muck. An expensive wastewater treatment plant was built on the U.S. side to handle Tijuana wastewater in the late 1990s, but the sewage spills have continued unabated.
Partlow said he was not politically engaged until one particularly disgusting day in February 2017, when he went to the beach to bodysurf and was overcome by the smell of poop. ""I couldn't breathe,"" he said. ""Couldn't even get close to the water.""
A massive spill had sent 143 million gallons of raw sewage into the Tijuana River, which forced the closure of beaches from the border all the way up to Coronado.
Last week, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against California, challenging the constitutionality of laws designed to protect immigrants.
A week earlier, a group of California officials sued the federal government. In their complaint, representatives from Imperial Beach, Chula Vista and the Port of San Diego allege the feds have violated the Clean Water Act by failing to take effective action against the water pollution that has ruined our state's southernmost beaches.
The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that the local Border Patrol union has also considered suing after some of its officers experienced respiratory problems and infections it blames on the toxic runoff. One former Border Patrol officer, Joshua Willey, said last week that he'd nearly lost his arm in 2010 after contracting an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria in the water off Coronado during a training exercise.
Don't count on any intervention from Trump. Dealing with stinky sewage and toxic sludge may be critical to human health. It just doesn't excite his base.

A judge has agreed to let five additional accusers of Bill Cosby testify at his April 2 sexual assault retrial.
Judge Steven O'Neill's ruling Thursday is a victory for prosecutors looking to portray the 80-year-old Cosby as one of Hollywood's biggest serial predators.
Prosecutors contend the alleged 2004 assault that led to Cosby's only criminal charges was the latest in a five-decade pattern of him drugging and attacking dozens of women.
Cosby's lawyers fought the move. They argued prosecutors were looking to bolster a weak case with ""ancient allegations"" that would confuse and distract jurors in the #MeToo era.
O'Neill limited prosecutors at Cosby's first trial last year to calling only the 2004 accuser and a woman who alleged a 1990s assault. That trial ended in a hung jury.", politics

WASHINGTON — Before Tuesday’s special election in Pennsylvania, most signs pointed to a Democratic wave in the upcoming midterm elections. But after Democrat Conor Lamb scored a razor-thin congressional victory in the heart of Trump Country, there’s a creeping consensus that the wave could become a tsunami. 
The political spin doctors were out in full force Wednesday, as Republicans licked their wounds from an embarrassing loss and Democrats bellowed with confidence after winning a Pennsylvania district that Donald Trump took by 20 points in 2016. 
Each side tried to parse what the results could mean for the midterm elections in November, when Democrats will attempt to wrest control of the House of Representatives from Republicans amid a growing backlash against the president.
In an ominous sign for the GOP, there are 114 districts currently held by Republicans where Trump’s margin of victory was smaller than in the Pennsylvania district won by Lamb Tuesday.
“The ground that Republicans are standing on is incredibly shaky, and we saw that last night,” said Douglas Heye, former communications director of the Republican National Committee. “The signs are pointing to a very bad November.” 
The Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, may still contest the outcome, but Conor Lamb’s 627-vote lead Wednesday afternoon appeared insurmountable.
Republican leaders, at least publicly, attempted to downplay the results, saying Lamb benefited from not having a primary opponent, which allowed him to stake out more conservative positions that were attractive to voters in that district. They also said the Republican in the race, state Representative Rick Saccone, was a uniquely bad candidate. 
Lamb held a 627-vote lead on Wednesday, leading several news organizations to declare him the winner. Lamb claimed victory, but Saccone has not conceded defeat. The margin was small enough for Saccone to call for a recount. 


Pollsters and other nonpartisan political strategists see the results in Pennsylvania as only the latest in a string of warning signs for Republicans that began shortly after the election of Trump. 
“We got our ass kicked,” Senator John N. Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said on Capitol Hill Wednesday, one of the rare unequivocal statements made by a GOP lawmaker. 

It was the latest in a series of Democratic wins during off-year elections. They swept to victory in governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey, and Senator Doug Jones surprised Republican candidate Roy Moore in the Alabama special election in December. 
Democrats have also won a spate of state legislature races around the country, including in districts that strongly backed Trump in 2016.
More importantly, pollsters say, are the demographic trends that have been constant throughout the races. From Virginia to Alabama and most of the special elections in between, the suburban voters who broke for Trump in the last days of the 2016 election seemed to have flipped to Democratic candidates. Additionally, Trump has inspired new energy among liberals, who now make up a greater share of the electorate.
“I’d put the probability that Democrats pick up the 24 seats they need for control of the House at almost 100 percent,” said Rachel Bitecofer, a pollster and the assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy in Virginia. “I think Republicans are going to lose control of the House, and then, beyond that, I’m thinking somewhere around 40 and 60 seats if the election is held today and Donald Trump is still the president. Because everything is conditioned on that.” 
Other political observers added caveats but offered similar predictions. Much can change between March and November, said one longtime Republican operative, who acknowledged the results are certainly bad signs for conserv-ative candidates. 
In Western Pennsylvania, “These were strong Trump base voters, and we couldn’t get enough of them to get our guy over the line,” said Stuart Stevens, an anti-Trump Republican operative and former top strategist for Republican Mitt Romney. “So there’s nothing positive.” 
House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a press conference Wednesday morning that many Republicans running in November would have the benefit of incumbency and he was unconvinced Democrats could replicate Lamb’s candidacy across the country. 
“This is something you’re not going to see repeated because [Democrats] didn’t have a primary and were able to pick a candidate that was able to run as a conservative — who ran against the minority leader [Nancy Pelosi] and ran on a conservative agenda,” Ryan said.
But even other conservatives disagreed with that analysis. While Lamb had some conservative positions, he also campaigned against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and vocally opposed the Republicans’ recently passed tax-cut legislation. 
Lamb did say he would not vote for Pelosi to keep her leadership post, but he also embraced several younger Democrats, including Massachusetts Representatives Joe Kennedy III and Seth Moulton. 
“This campaign has . . .  shown what Democrats can do when we’re willing to run everywhere,’’ said Moulton in a statement. He aggressively campaigned and fund-raised for Lamb, “The political establishment, on both sides, told Conor he couldn’t win. But by continuing to invest in the right candidates, challenging the status quo, and talking about a forward-looking message for the country, we can take back the House and hold President Trump accountable to the American people.” 
The race in Pennsylvania was also fought in a district that seemed primed to embrace Republican arguments on the tax reform bill passed last year as well as Trump’s recent decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum as a way to revitalize communities like suburban Pittsburgh, from where many of Tuesday’s voters came. The fact that Republicans have fared so poorly could be an indication of the limits of those political arguments.
Heye, the Republican consultant and former RNC spokesman, said he thought Ryan’s reading of the election was overly rosy. Heye expected Republicans to wake up Wednesday feeling more nervous about their midterm positions, saying they need to “deal with the reality on the ground” that Trump is not popular. 
Currently, Trump’s overall approval rating is 40 percent, almost 5 points lower than Barack Obama’s in 2010, when the Tea Party backlash in the midterms upended his presidency. 
As for the Democrats, the group has rarely been more confident. After their good showing in Pennsylvania, the Democrats’ campaign arm for House races — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — added 13 new districts to its “watch list.” 
One of the new additions: Ryan’s district in Wisconsin. 
“Hi, @PRyan, your own district is almost twice as competitive as #PA18. You may be in the state of denial, but our sights are set on the state of Wisconsin,” the group tweeted on Wednesday morning.
Another sign of the growing confidence: Representative Ben Ray Luján, the DCCC chair, spent Wednesday calling potential candidate recruits.  
But while Democrats and Republicans crowed back and forth, there was one notably silent voice Wednesday morning — President Trump. His normally active Twitter account often sets the news of the day or reacts to morning political shows, but the @realDonaldTrump account was quiet on the biggest political story of the day.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan is privately warning Republicans of a ‘‘bit of a wake-up call’’ as Democrat Conor Lamb edged past the Republican in the Pennsylvania special election.
Ryan told House Republicans on Wednesday they need to ‘‘get to work,’’ fundraise and not be caught off guard heading into a midterm campaign season where Democratic enthusiasm is real. That’s according to two people familiar with Ryan’s remarks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Publicly, Ryan was more upbeat, blaming the Pennsylvania outcome in a Trump-heavy district on Lamb’s centrist views. Ryan says, ‘‘you’re not going to see repeated’’ in November, as Republicans try to retain their majority.
Ryan urged colleagues to tout the GOP-passed tax plan and remind voters that Democrats opposed it.

WASHINGTON — The Senate passed bipartisan legislation Wednesday designed to ease bank rules that were enacted to prevent a relapse of the 2008 financial crisis that caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs and homes.
The Senate voted 67-31 for a bill from Republican Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho that would dial back portions of the law known as Dodd-Frank.
The legislation would increase the threshold at which banks are considered so big and plugged into the financial grid that if one were to fail it would cause major havoc. Those banks are subject to stricter capital and planning requirements. Lawmakers are intent on loosening the restraints on them in hopes that it will boost lending and the economy.
Republicans unanimously supported the bill, while Democrats splintered into two camps. One included several senators from rural states who worked out the compromise with Crapo. The other, led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, said the bill catered too much to the banks that contributed to the financial crisis and would increase the likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts.
‘‘Big banks and their lobbyists are about to score a touchdown at the expense of hardworking families across the country,’’ Brown said shortly before the vote.
The bill makes a fivefold increase, to $250 billion, in the level of assets at which banks are deemed to pose a potential threat if they failed. The change would ease regulations and oversight on more than two dozen financial companies, including BB&T Corp., SunTrust Banks, Fifth Third Bancorp and American Express.
Eventually, the exempted banks would no longer have to undergo an annual stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The test assesses whether a bank has enough of a capital buffer to survive an economic shock and continue lending. The banks also would be excused from submitting plans called ‘‘living wills’’ that spell out how a bank would sell off assets or be liquidated in the event of failure so that it wouldn’t create chaos in the financial system.
Crapo, chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, emphasized that the Federal Reserve would still have the authority to apply tougher standards for banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets. ‘‘This bill, Mr. President, is a bill designed to protect community banks and credit unions, and that’s why we have such bipartisan support for it.’’
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Dodd-Frank proved to be ‘‘too blunt’’ an instrument. He said it hurt smaller lenders who provide more than 50 percent of small business loans and more than 80 percent of agricultural loans.
‘‘Regulations meant for Wall Street are crushing Main Street,’’ McConnell said.
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said that while he had helped write some provisions of the Dodd-Frank legislation, he knew at the time it would have to be tweaked in the years ahead. He said the new bill is not designed to be an overhaul.
‘‘If the banking bill before us today becomes law, 90 percent of Dodd-Frank would remain unchanged,’’ Carper said.
In arguing against the bill, Brown noted that the Congressional Budget Office found that it would slightly increase the probability of a big bank failure, which would add to the deficit.
Other features of the bill would exempt certain banks and credit unions from requirements to report some mortgage loan data. That exempted data includes the age of a loan applicant, credit score, total loan costs and interest rate. Warren, an outspoken opponent of the change, said the bill would make it easier for banks to discriminate against minorities seeking home mortgages and go undetected.
In response to the Equifax breach that exposed personal information for more than 145 million Americans, the bill would require free credit freezes for all consumers affected by data breaches. Currently most states allow the credit reporting companies to charge consumers a fee for freezing their credit.
The House has already passed more a more expansive rollback of Dodd-Frank. Now, lawmakers will try to work out a compromise that both chambers can support. That may be difficult as negotiators try to appease GOP lawmakers without losing the support of the core group of Democratic senators who backed Crapo’s legislation.
In all, 16 Democrats and one independent senator voted with Republicans on the bill, a rarity for major legislation.
‘‘Many people are worried about the gridlock in Congress,’’ Crapo said. ‘‘This bill shows that we can work together and can do big things that make a big difference in the lives of people across this country.’’

WASHINGTON — Housing and Urban Development officials repeatedly consulted with Secretary Ben Carson’s wife about the prospect of redecorating his office last year, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.
The push to redecorate Carson’s office in the weeks following President Trump’s inauguration — even before the former pediatric neurosurgeon had taken office — has come under congressional scrutiny in recent weeks. HUD’s former chief administrative officer, Helen Foster, filed a complaint with the department’s special counsel last fall charging that she was demoted in part because she warned other officials the planned refurbishment would require congressional notification, because it would exceed $5,000.
The 163-page release, obtained by the left-leaning group American Oversight, includes e-mail exchanges over the course of last year in which top HUD staffers vet different furniture options and solicit input from Carson’s wife, Candy Carson, as well as the secretary.
In a Feb. 20, 2017, e-mail, for example, Sheila Greenwood — who at the time was serving on Trump’s HUD transition team — wrote to Aida Rodriguez, an administrative officer in the secretary’s office: ‘‘I think it was you who told me last week that there were some furniture board/choices for Mrs. Carson to see. I will see her tomorrow if I can get those in the morning. Thanks!’’
In her complaint, Foster said that shortly before Trump’s inauguration, soon-to-be acting secretary Craig Clemmensen told her Candy Carson wanted the office overhauled, and she needed to find money to fund the project. Ben Carson was nominated in December 2016 to lead the agency.
Foster wrote in a Feb. 22 e-mail that she had to answer ‘‘endless questions about why I won’t fund more than the $5000 limit’’ for redecorating the office. ‘‘I do like 3 meetings a day on that . . . I hate this.’’
Asked about Foster’s allegations late last month, HUD spokesman Raffi Williams said: ‘‘When presented with options by professional staff, Mrs. Carson participated in the selection of specific styles.’’
Earlier, he said that department staff had gone to considerable lengths to save taxpayers money in refurbishing the office, in part by bringing up furniture from HUD’s basement.
‘‘Secretary Carson, to our knowledge, is the only HUD Secretary to go to the subbasement of his agency to select the furniture for his office,’’ Williams said. ‘‘All the furniture in his office was purchased by the government prior to his arrival.’’

The newly released documents detail the hunt for used agency furniture, with Rodriguez expressing initial skepticism about the search. In a Feb. 21 e-mail, she wrote to Greenwood and others that the subbasement would have ‘‘nothing suitable for the Secretary’’ because ‘‘the nicest desks/conference tables are the [ones] that are currently occupying the Secretary and [deputy secretary’s] private offices.’’
Two days later, however, another HUD staffer reported that officials had located used furniture there that would be delivered to both the secretary and deputy secretary’s offices.
The furniture hunt did not end in February, however: An aging conference table and its accompanying chairs used for Carson’s private lunches with guests proved so problematic that his deputies decided to order a replacement, at a cost of $31,561. The set included a Newport dining table with a mahogany finish and upholstered chairs.
Carson’s wife weighed in on that purchase, as well, according to e-mails between Rodriguez and colleagues including Greenwood, currently the secretary’s chief of staff.
Austin Evers, American Oversight’s executive director, said in a statement that the effort to upgrade Carson’s immediate surroundings is at odds with some of his policy positions, including a quip he made during an interview with the New York Times in May that public housing officials should avoid creating ‘‘a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say: ‘I’ll just stay here. They will take care of me.’ ’’

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is reviewing a recommendation that it fire former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, days ahead of his scheduled retirement, amid an inspector general investigation expected to be harshly critical of him, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The recommendation from officials with the Office of Professional Responsibility was sent to Justice Department leaders but has not been acted on yet, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about an internal personnel matter.
McCabe, a frequent target of President Donald Trump’s criticism even before the election, has been on leave from the FBI since stepping down in January from his deputy director position. He is scheduled to retire on Sunday after a 22-year career.
The inspector general’s office, which for more than a year investigated the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, has concluded that McCabe authorized FBI officials to speak with a journalist for an October 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal. Though Trump has criticized McCabe as biased against him, the story in question actually undercut that narrative and suggested that FBI officials wanted to more actively probe the Clinton Foundation but were discouraged from more aggressive steps by the Obama Justice Department.
The person familiar with the matter said McCabe is suspected of having not been forthcoming with officials from the inspector general’s office who were investigating the media leak — an allegation he denies.
McCabe did not return a call seeking comment.
Trump has frequently singled out McCabe in arguing that FBI leadership is biased against his administration. He had attacked McCabe on the campaign trail, too, following the revelation that his wife had accepted campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally, during a failed state Senate run.
The FBI has said McCabe received ethics approval and was not overseeing the Clinton investigation at the time.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific recommendation from the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility, which is responsible for employee disciplinary matters and is made up of career employees.
‘‘The Department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated,’’ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. ‘‘That process includes recommendations from career employees and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.’’

These kids have found their cause.
On what would normally be a snow day spent at home, hundreds of students marched to the State House to call for stricter gun laws on Wednesday, part of a nationwide day of walkouts and demonstrations marking one month since 17 people were killed at a Florida high school.
The students — from Weston and Wellesley, Malden and Somerville, Roxbury and Dorchester — held handmade signs and chanted “What do we want? Gun control now!” and “Not in our schools! Not in our streets!”
The students were among tens of thousands across the country who walked out of their classrooms and massed on state capitols, angry and frustrated at the lack of federal action to stem gun violence, despite mass shooting after shooting.
In New York, hundreds of students marched in the streets, while in Washington, sign-clutching students gathered outside the White House and on Capitol Hill.
In nearly 3,000 protests nationwide, students from the elementary to college level are taking up the call in a variety of ways.
One of those marching to the Massachusetts State House was JQ Welch, an eighth-grader from Somerville, who was wearing a bulletproof backpack that his mother bought him a week after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. 
“I have to be careful when I walk the halls because someone could just walk into school with a weapon concealed in their backpack, take it out, and start firing wildly, and I don’t want to die,”  said Welch, 13. “That’s the main point. And if I die, then my blood will be on the conservatives’ hands, the GOP’s hands, the NRA’s hands.”
Nationwide, the demonstrations unfolded in different ways from city to city and school to school. In some schools, students chanted and held signs. At others, they stood in silence. In Atlanta, some students took a knee. 
In Newtown, Conn., where 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, hundreds of students filed out of Newtown High School just moments before 10 a.m. and gathered in a parking lot near the football field.
In Massachusetts, many students had also planned to walk out of classes at 10 a.m. for 17 minutes — one minute for each victim in the Florida shooting.
But with many schools closed because of Tuesday’s blizzard, students here postponed their walkouts and instead converged on the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, across Boston Common from the State House. 
From there, they marched up a snowy path into the State House — cheering and chanting — and gathered in a large auditorium, where a panel of legislators listened to them speak. 
Addressing the student assembly, Vikiana Petit-Homme, 16, a junior at Boston Latin Academy, acknowledged Massachusetts has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation and the nation’s lowest gun-death rate. But she said more can be done. 
“The fight is not over,” she said, as students snapped their fingers in approval. “The fight is ongoing in Mattapan, in Dorchester, in Roxbury, and other communities of color. As long as people are being killed with guns, then we are not doing enough. Massachusetts is not doing enough.”
After the speeches, the students, using paper maps to navigate the State House’s maze-like hallways, visited legislators’ offices to press their concerns further. 
Many were advocating for a federal assault weapons ban, stronger federal background checks, and the passage of state legislation that would allow family and household members to petition courts to temporarily remove guns from individuals who pose risks to the public or themselves.
As the students were lobbying, the Gun Owners’ Action League of Massachusetts, the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association, sent an e-mail to its members asking them to videotape their children’s walkouts. 
The e-mail asked parents to document “what’s being said, what the signs say, and what teachers/faculty/guests are saying.”
“If you see anything indicating that these walkouts are pushing an anti-civil rights agenda, please e-mail us information,” the group stated.
Jim Wallace, the league’s executive director, said the request to record the walkouts came from several members of his group who have expressed concern that school officials and teachers are backing the protests and pushing a biased agenda. 
“We’re very concerned that children were being bullied into participating in these events, and there are public resources being used to push these events,” Wallace said. “Are these students actually being educated on this issue, or are they being indoctrinated?”
Administrators in many districts have sought to inoculate themselves from such criticism. In e-mails to parents, they have said they want students to express their views but will not endorse their calls for gun control.
The walkouts have been organized by Empower, the youth wing of the Women’s March, which took place last year. Another series of anti-gun-violence marches is scheduled in Washington, Boston, and dozens of other cities on March 24.  
Wednesday’s march to the State House was student-led but supported by the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence and Stop Handgun Violence.
Many of the students said they found out about the march on social media and organized their friends and classmates to show up at the State House.
Remi Jacob, 20, a sophomore at Emerson College, said she was inspired by the survivors at Stoneman Douglas, who have been outspoken in calling for tougher gun laws. 
“If these people can do it, why aren’t we on their team, too?” said Jacob, who was wielding a bullhorn. “If we’re not going to accept this responsibility to change, who is?”

WASHINGTON — President Trump stressed the close ties between Ireland and America at a St. Patrick’s Day luncheon Thursday, though he joked that the country was a ‘‘tough one to compete with’’ on taxes.
Trump appeared with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar as part of a day of joint events marking the holiday, including a one-on-one visit at the White House. Both leaders spoke at a luncheon at the US Capitol with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.
After noting a number of famous Irish Americans, Trump said: ‘‘Whenever there’s a problem, you call, we’ll solve it.’’
Amid laughter, he added: ‘‘Except for trade. . . . They’ve got those taxes so low. You’re a tough one to compete with on the taxes.’’ 
Trump recently signed a massive tax cut into law, aimed at leveling the playing field with countries like Ireland that have low corporate taxes.
Varadkar — the recently elected Irish leader or Taoiseach — said the two had a good meeting, noting that they spoke about Irish people living in the US illegally, the negotiations over the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and trade.
‘‘I think we can have a new fair trade, free trade deal between Europe and America and there’s no better man to make a deal than President Trump,’’ Varadkar said.
Ryan also referenced trade, albeit in jest.
‘‘The Guinness does taste better in Ireland, but I realize this isn’t the year to bring up trade issues,’’ he said.
During a sit-down with Varadkar at the White House, Trump was asked if he would visit Ireland. The president said: ‘‘I will. I love it.’’ He offered no further details.
Trump said the two countries have an ‘‘outstanding relationship.’’
‘‘A tremendous number of Irish are living in New York, where I grew up and they’re living in the United States,’’ said Trump, who also owns a golf club in Ireland. ‘‘And these are truly wonderful people.’’
Trump was also pushed over whether he would visit the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a key unresolved issue in Brexit talks so far. He said that was ‘‘an interesting border also.’’

The 39-year-old Varadkar is Ireland’s youngest prime minister. He’s the son of an Indian immigrant and the first openly gay politician in the post. He noted that he was in Washington years ago as a congressional intern, but never saw the Oval Office.

When Frank Guinta first ran for the New Hampshire congressional seat he won eight years ago, he was quick to criticize one of his biggest challengers for being a lobbyist.
Now, after being defeated in 2016 . . . well, you know where this is going.
A full year out of office, Guinta has joined ML Strategies, the lobbying arm of the Mintz Levin law firm. ML Strategies is the largest lobbying firm in Massachusetts, according to the Boston Business Journal. He joins the firm’s Washington office.
In addition to serving two terms in Congress, Guinta also served as the mayor of Manchester.
“Frank is well-known and highly-respected by his former congressional colleagues,” said Stephen P. Tocco, chairman and chief executive officer of ML Strategies. “Frank will bring a great value to our clients given his years of experience in and his keen understanding of the intersection of business and government.”
Guinta could not be reached for comment.
Guinta had a rocky tenure in Congress. New Hampshire’s First Congressional District is the biggest swing district in the country; Guinta won two races for the seat and lost two. While he was in office, he admitted to filing improper campaign finance records in which he failed to properly record a loan from a family trust.
Prior to being mayor, he worked as a key congressional aide and in the health care industry.

There are now four candidates vying for the job held by Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, whose announcement last month that he will not seek reelection has sparked what is expected to be a heated race for the seat.
Rachael Rollins, former chief legal counsel of the Massachusetts Port Authority and former president of the Massachusetts Black Lawyers Association, is the latest candidate to announce her plans to run for the top prosecutor job in the county.
A former state prosecutor and federal prosecutor whose cases included white collar crimes, fraud, and drug and gun offenses, Rollins said she would create a more transparent office committed to criminal justice reform.
“The district attorney is charged with ensuring the safety of the residents of Suffolk County and obtaining justice for victims. They also serve as the moral backbone of the criminal justice system, assuring equity and fairness in the process for everyone,” Rollins said in a prepared statement. “We deserve a system where addiction, poverty, and mental illness are not criminalized; where socio-economic status and race don’t increase the likelihood that someone is incarcerated; and where the district attorney, prosecutors, and members of law enforcement are a true reflection of the rich diversity in the communities that they are sworn to protect and serve.”
Rollins joins a field that includes Suffolk prosecutor and former teacher Greg Henning; Shannon MacAuliffe, a defense attorney and former head of ROCA, a youth center based in Chelsea; and State Representative Evandro C. Carvalho, a former prosecutor in Conley’s office.
All four are running as Democrats who will compete in the September primary. District attorney races are normally a sleepy affair, but debates about criminal justice reform have brought about more interest in the seat.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which has launched “What a Difference a DA Makes” a campaign meant to increase voter awareness about the race, will host a debate for the candidates on June 7 at the Hiberian Hall in Roxbury.

Philips Hue Outdoor Lights
These folks are using the Apple Hue lights, which are compatible with just about every smart home platform you can throw at them.
Philips
Shouting commands at your smart home devices is supposed to be easier than flipping physical switches—you don’t even have to get up off your couch. But, the whole experience often still feels too segmented. If I want to turn off specific Philips Hue lights in my house without going through the trouble of assigning them to a group or zone, I have to shout repetitive commands like the loudspeaker at the airport.
This week, however, Google pushed out the Routines functionality for the Home platform, which allows for multi-step processes that fire with the prompt of a single voice command. The release comes roughly five months after Amazon pushed out a similar Routines feature to its Alexa-based Echo smart hubs. Apple’s Home has similar capabilities called Scenes baked into its Home app.
Here’s a look at how these multi-step routines work on the various platforms, as well as a few workarounds in case they still don’t do what you want.
Right now, there are six different Routines you can enable in Google Home:
Good Morning
Leaving Home
I’m Home
Commuting to Work
Commuting to Home
You can get a full rundown of what each one does in its default setup on the official Google help page. “Good Morning” for instance, takes your Android phone off silent mode, turns on smart devices like plugs, tells you about customizable information like weather, traffic, or your calendar, and then plays music, the radio, or even a podcast as the soundtrack for getting ready.
The Routines also tie into the Google-owned Nest thermostat, so you can set it to warm up or cool down, depending on what part of your day it is.
In order to set up Google Home Routines, you’ll have to use the Google Home App. You’ll also need the app to initiate the commuting-based Routines, which makes sense since you’re going to be on the road anyway.
One nice advantage for the Google Home routines comes from the fact that Google can recognize different voices and sync them to individual Google accounts. So, if you and your partner or roommate have different morning routines, the device will recognize who is speaking and take the correct action.
Alexa Routines
Saying ""good morning"" to a speaker and light bulb never made so much sense.
Amazon
Alexa has been triggering routines since last fall, so the service has had a little time to mature and grow. It has pluses and minuses when compared to Google’s system.
One of the big boons for Alexa is that the Routines are customizable. You can create custom smart home recipes that don’t have to remain tied to predetermined commands or arrangements.
Like with Google, Alexa’s Routines are a mixture of information and smart home control. So, you can easily make a custom morning sequence that turns off the smart plug powering your white noise machine, turns up your thermostat, and gives you information.
You can set the Routines to repeat on a daily basis, or on specific days, so if you want to use it as an alarm and wake up everyday for work, but not on the weekends, you can do that.
While the customizability is a success in some areas, it falls a little short in others, mostly due to compatibility issues. You can’t, for instance, have Alexa start playing music after your briefing is over. You also can’t integrate things like audiobooks into your Routines, so your “Alexa, read me a story” command won’t create the cozy listening atmosphere you want just yet, at least without a few voice commands. You also can’t trigger skills developed by third parties as part of a Routine for the time being.
Apple Scenes
Apple's Home app is the command center for its Scenes.
Apple
Siri and company over in Cupertino were grouping smart home commands together as part of the HomeKit platform before Google or Amazon. In order to enable this function, you have to create a scene in the Home iOS app by dragging and dropping icons for compatible devices into groups. Assuming you have all your devices setup properly and connected to Wi-Fi, it’s a very simple implementation.
You can trigger scenes with a tap in the Home app, or by asking Siri to set things in motion for you. Siri still can’t tell the difference between users’ voices, however, so you have to set them up separately for each.
The Home platform does a solid job allowing you to arrange your devices into separate rooms and zones, which you can use to specify where commands take effect. So, if you made an “I’m home” scene, you could turn on the lights by the door to see what you’re doing.
In terms of hardware, Apple is in a different situation than Google or Amazon, both of which primarily rely on dedicated home hubs and speakers, like the Google Home speakers or the ever-expanding line of Amazon Echo devices. Apple only offers the $350 HomePod as a dedicated speaker, but the company also deputizes other devices like the Apple TV to act as hubs for smart home control.
IFTTT
The If This Then That app allows you to make actions out of devices and services that may not be otherwise compatible.
IFTTT
Synergy between devices will improve as we go forward, but if you want an action now and it’s not specifically supported, check with a service called If This Then Than, or IFTTT (Android, iOS). It’s an external platform that creates recipes from individual actions. So, if you want to have your lamp send a tweet to your followers every time your turn on the lights, you could do it if you wanted to.
This is a good solution if you want to integrate Alexa skills into more complex actions, or you want to rope in third-party services like social media sites.
While your options are still somewhat limited at the moment, especially compared to the fully-automated, robotic smart homes of your dreams, the companies are constantly adding new functionality in order to try and rope users into their platforms. Keep your respective home apps updated and check the support pages from time to time to check for new stuff.

Some of the dumbest inventions of recent decades are bursting forth from that wonder of our age, the internet of things (IoT). Take, for instance, the connected “killer kettle”. You can turn it on at the click of a smartphone app – even when the kettle is empty, creating a fire risk.
Then there are smart sockets that can be activated by an app, perhaps turning on electric fires that your housemate has since placed near something flammable. And let’s not forget the colour-changing smart light bulbs that hand user …

Artificial intelligence is poised to take over earthquake monitoring. It can help better locate the origin of earthquakes and also predict how devastating they might be.
During an earthquake, different types of seismic waves travel through the earth. The first to arrive at any location are called P-waves, which compress and decompress the Earth’s crust, causing the ground to move back and forth. The more dangerous are the S-waves that come next, which cause the Earth to move up and down.

AI does the funniest things. Set a challenge for artificial intelligence to complete, and its solution can be clever, surprising, or outright funny. That’s what Joel Lehman and Jeff Clune at Uber AI Labs, and Dusan Misevic at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity in Paris, found when they compiled a list of the best tales of AI trickery throughout the years.

Vegan numbers are on the rise. To try to encourage everyone and their dog to join the movement, a startup in California are growing fungus-based dog food in bioreactors. Wild Earth touts its vegan food as ‘clean protein’ that has all the nutrients a dog needs, hoping to appeal to people concerned about the significant carbon footprint of pet food, as well as the use of low-quality animal byproducts.
The company makes the unusual food by pumping sugar into a bioreactor, a large cylindrical apparatus for growing fungi. This allows their fast-growing fungus …

XPRIZE
By Timothy Revell

A new $10 million XPrize competition wants anyone to be able to control a robot and carry out tasks from 100 kilometres away. Not just that, but untrained users should be able to feel, hear and touch their surroundings too.
This latest ambitious XPrize challenge  – the ANA XPrize Avatar Challenge – was launched by the non-profit today at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. It is sponsored by the Japanese airline ANA. Teams should submit their plans to a panel of expert judges by the end of January 2019.

In April 2020 and April 2021, teams will then have to show what their avatars can do with a $1 million prize purse available for the best performers available each year. Then, in October 2021, a bumper $8 million will be up for grabs, with teams tested over a five-day finale.
“Our ability to physically experience another geographic location, or to provide on-the-ground assistance where needed, is limited by cost and the simple availability of time,” says Peter Diamandis, one of the XPrize founders.
Eventually, XPrize hope that the technology developed for the competition will enable people to deploy immediate emergency response in natural disaster scenarios, without needing to send people around the world, or expose them to hazardous environments.
“The idea is that if there was another nuclear disaster like in Fukushima, we could send avatars instead of people,” says Jyotika Virmani, at XPrize.
Previous XPrize challenges have included the $30 million Google Lunar XPrize, which was shelved in January, after no team was able to be the first to put a private rover on the moon.

ISRO
By Leah Crane
A Silicon Valley start-up has been accused of sending four tiny satellites into orbit without permission. If it did so, this would be the first ever unauthorised satellite launch, and it could put other larger satellites in danger.
The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates commercial satellites from US companies, made the accusation in an email exchange with Sara Spangelo, CEO of Swarm Technologies, which was put online by IEEE Spectrum. The FCC had denied Swarm’s application for their “SpaceBee” satellites in December 2017.
A manifest released by the Indian Space Research Organisation indicated that the tiny satellites were aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle that launched from Sriharikota, India, on 12 January. The SpaceBees are communications satellites intended to provide connectivity for internet-enabled devices and sensors.

Swarm Technologies has not yet replied to New Scientist’s request for comment.
In the December denial letter, the FCC cited the diminutive size of the SpaceBees as troublesome. At only 10 centimetres square and 2.8 centimetres tall, they are too small to reliably track, making it difficult to be certain they won’t crash into other satellites.
The letter cites difficulty to “plan effective collision avoidance maneuvers” as one reason for denying approval for the launch. “Accordingly, we cannot conclude that a grant of this application is in the public interest,” the letter says.
According to an investigation by IEEE Spectrum, neither the Indian Space Research Organization nor Spaceflight, the firm that supplied the satellites, could confirm that they check FCC licences for all customers.
Swarm’s next launch, planned for April, is now in jeopardy. The FCC had previously granted a licence, but has now set aside that permission “in order to permit assessment of the impact of the applicant’s apparent unauthorized launch and operation of four satellites”.

Mass thought control may not be on the cards just yet, but mind-reading tech is developing fast. We need to be prepared
Bombaert Patrick/Getty

HOWEVER much technology knows about you – and you would be surprised how much it does (see “I exposed how firms and politicians can manipulate us online”) – there is one firewall that it can’t penetrate: your skull. Unless you choose to share your thoughts, they remain private.
But for how much longer? Increasingly, a combination of brain scanning and artificial intelligence is opening the black box, gathering signals from deep inside the mind and reverse-engineering them to recreate thoughts. For now, the technology is limited to vision – working out what somebody is looking at from their brain activity (see “Mind-reading AI uses brain scans to guess what you’re looking at”) – but in principle there appears no reason why the entire contents of our minds couldn’t be revealed.

This line of research inevitably raises fears about the ultimate invasion of privacy: mind reading. It is not difficult to imagine some sort of device that can simply be pointed at somebody’s head to extract their thoughts.
Not difficult to imagine, but extremely difficult to realise. At present, the scanning part is done by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This requires an extremely large and expensive piece of equipment and, crucially, the total consent of the brain being scanned. Subjects have to enter a narrow tunnel on a gurney with their head held perfectly still, and submit to a lengthy examination. On top of that, fMRI is still a fairly crude device for mind reading. It has been criticised for producing colourful cartoons of brain activity but not much actual data.
Other imaging techniques are available, but none could easily be turned into a portable device inconspicuous enough to use without the subject’s consent. The simplest, EEG, has to be donned like a cap or headband and is hopelessly inaccurate unless the subject is not moving.
“In principle there appears no reason why the entire contents of our minds could not be revealed”
Nevertheless, we should not dismiss mind reading as being forever confined to laboratory conditions. The AI side of the equation is a game changer: with enough training, perhaps it could learn to extract useful signals from a noisy EEG trace.
Even today, the combination of fMRI and AI could be developed for limited uses, such as accessing the thoughts of people in a minimally conscious state. This is possible to some extent now, and is already controversial.
Similarly, it may be feasible to develop polygraph-like tests for people accused of crimes, to assess what they really know. Again, this is not without precedent and is extremely contentious. A decade ago a US-based company called Cephos began selling fMRI scans to defendants. Around the same time, courts in India started accepting evidence from an extremely controversial brain scanning technique called brain electrical oscillation signature (BEOS) profiling.
Cephos ceased selling scans in 2010 after a court ruled the technology wasn’t permissible, but other companies have stepped in to offer similar things; BEOS profiling is still being used in the Indian legal system.
Mass surveillance mind-reading is not on the cards. But even the limited applications are troubling. That is one black box we should think very hard about opening.

The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will.
United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West’s critical facilities in the event of a conflict.
They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated.
In the following months, according to a  Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants.

Still, new computer screenshots released by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday made clear that Russian state hackers had the foothold they would have needed to manipulate or shut down power plants.
Advertisement
“We now have evidence they’re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,” said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, a digital security firm.
“From what we can see, they were there. They have the ability to shut the power off. All that’s missing is some political motivation,” Mr. Chien said.
American intelligence agencies were aware of the attacks for the past year and a half, and the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. first issued urgent warnings to utility companies in June. On Thursday, both agencies offered new details as the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations it accused of election meddling and “malicious cyberattacks.”
It was the first time the administration officially named Russia as the perpetrator of the assaults. And it marked the third time in recent months that the White House, departing from its usual reluctance to publicly reveal intelligence, blamed foreign government forces for attacks on infrastructure in the United States.
In December, the White House said North Korea had carried out the so-called WannaCry attack that in May paralyzed the British health system and placed ransomware in computers in schools, businesses and homes across the world. Last month, it accused Russia of being behind the NotPetya attack against Ukraine last June, the largest in a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine to date, paralyzing the country’s government agencies and financial systems.
But the penalties have been light. So far, Mr. Trump has said little to nothing about the Russian role in those attacks.
The groups that conducted the energy attacks, which are linked to Russian intelligence agencies, appear to be different from the two hacking groups that were involved in the election interference.

That would suggest that at least three separate Russian cyberoperations were underway simultaneously. One focused on stealing documents from the Democratic National Committee and other political groups. Another, by a St. Petersburg “troll farm” known as the Internet Research Agency, used social media to sow discord and division. A third effort sought to burrow into the infrastructure of American and European nations.
For years, American intelligence officials tracked a number of Russian state-sponsored hacking units as they successfully penetrated the computer networks of critical infrastructure operators across North America and Europe, including in Ukraine.
Some of the units worked inside Russia’s Federal Security Service, the K.G.B. successor known by its Russian acronym, F.S.B.; others were embedded in the Russian military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. Still others were made up of Russian contractors working at the behest of Moscow.
Russian cyberattacks surged last year, starting three months after Mr. Trump took office.
American officials and private cybersecurity experts uncovered a series of Russian attacks aimed at the energy, water and aviation sectors and critical manufacturing, including nuclear plants, in the United States and Europe. In its urgent report in June, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. notified operators about the attacks but stopped short of identifying Russia as the culprit.

By then, Russian spies had compromised the business networks of several American energy, water and nuclear plants, mapping out their corporate structures and computer networks.
They included that of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear plant near Burlington, Kan. But in that case, and those of other nuclear operators, Russian hackers had not leapt from the company’s business networks into the nuclear plant controls.
Forensic analysis suggested that Russian spies were looking for inroads — although it was not clear whether the goal was to conduct espionage or sabotage, or to trigger an explosion of some kind.
In a report made public in October, Symantec noted that a Russian hacking unit “appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so.”

The United States sometimes does the same thing. It bored deeply into Iran’s infrastructure before the 2015 nuclear accord, placing digital “implants” in systems that would enable it to bring down power grids, command-and-control systems and other infrastructure in case a conflict broke out. The operation was code-named “Nitro Zeus,” and its revelation made clear that getting into the critical infrastructure of adversaries is now a standard element of preparing for possible conflict.
The Russians have gone farther.
In an updated warning to utility companies on Thursday, Homeland Security officials included a screenshot taken by Russian operatives that proved they could now gain access to their victims’ critical controls.
American officials and security firms, including Symantec and CrowdStrike, believe that Russian attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and 2016 that left more than 200,000 citizens there in the dark are an ominous sign of what the Russian cyberstrikes may portend in the United States and Europe in the event of escalating hostilities.
Private security firms have tracked the Russian government assaults on Western power and energy operators — conducted alternately by groups under the names DragonFly, Energetic Bear and Berserk Bear — since 2011, when they first started targeting defense and aviation companies in the United States and Canada.
By 2013, researchers had tied the Russian hackers to hundreds of attacks on energy grid and oil and gas pipeline operators in the United States and Europe. Initially, the strikes appeared to be motivated by industrial espionage — a natural conclusion at the time, researchers said, given the importance of Russia’s oil and gas industry.
But by December 2015, the Russian hacks had taken an aggressive turn. The attacks were no longer aimed at intelligence gathering, but at potentially sabotaging or shutting down plant operations.
At Symantec, researchers discovered that Russian hackers had begun taking screenshots of the machinery used in energy and nuclear plants, and stealing detailed descriptions of how they operated — suggesting they were conducting reconnaissance for a future attack.
As the American government enacted the sanctions on Thursday, cybersecurity experts were still questioning where the Russian attacks could lead, given that the United States was sure to respond in kind.

“Russia certainly has the technical capability to do damage, as it demonstrated in the Ukraine,” said Eric Cornelius, a cybersecurity expert at Cylance, a private security firm, who previously assessed critical infrastructure threats for the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration.
“It is unclear what their perceived benefit would be from causing damage on U.S. soil, especially given the retaliation it would provoke,” Mr. Cornelius said.
Though a major step toward deterrence, publicly naming countries accused of cyberattacks still is unlikely to shame them into stopping. The United States is struggling to come up with proportionate responses to the wide variety of cyberespionage, vandalism and outright attacks.
Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, who has been nominated as director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, the military’s cyberunit, said during his Senate confirmation hearing this month that countries attacking the United States so far have little to worry about.
“I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,” General Nakasone said. He later added, “They don’t fear us.”

Encounters 
By                     
CAROLINE TELL

MARCH 16, 2018

Earlier this month, Karlie Kloss invited four teenage girls to her homey office on Lafayette Street in SoHo, where she runs Klossy, a fashion, multimedia and philanthropic organization.
Dressed in a navy blue blazer, black turtleneck and cropped jeans, Ms. Kloss, 25, breezed in and hugged the girls, complimenting one’s bright yellow sweater, another’s combat boots. “I feel like you’ve all grown so much since I last saw you,” she said.
She walked over to the pristine kitchen, with its white subway tile backsplash and restaurant-grade appliances, and grabbed some goodies. “But first, we cupcake,” Ms. Kloss said as she led the young women into a conference room decorated with a bronze chandelier, modern art and flower bouquets. Her campers turned giddy as they took their seats around a wooden table.
“Beyond just wanting to hang out with you guys, I want you to be a part of our big announcement,” Ms. Kloss said. “You’re the reason we want to keep growing this.”
Advertisement
She was referring to Kode With Klossy, the coding camp she started in 2015 to empower girls to learn to code and become leaders in tech. Ms. Kloss went around the room, asking what each had been up to since attending her coding camp last summer.
Advertisement
Valeria Torres-Olivares, 18, from Princeton, N.J., was first to speak. She was accepted to Princeton University, where she’ll major in computer science. The room erupted into cheers. She also talked about the coding class she started at the Princeton Public Library with her younger sister Kyara, 14, a fellow camper.
“We made it girls-only so our students would have an environment they feel safe in,” Ms. Torres-Olivares said. “When boys are in the classroom, it’s harder.”
Another camper, Hope Dunner, 19, had completed a computer science internship at Microsoft. Victoria Johnston, 17, finished an internship at Viacom and now wants to use coding to pursue activism. “I’m creating a documentary series that combines fashion and personal stories, like what makes you different and unique,” Ms. Johnston said. “I’m also learning to come out of my shell.”
Ms. Kloss beamed. “This is so awesome, you guys.” she said.
A model of 11 years (she was discovered at a benefit fashion show in her hometown, St. Louis), Ms. Kloss became the face of brands including Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Versace. In her travels, she often found herself hobnobbing with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, and realized how technology was transforming society.
“I remember I had met Kevin Systrom, the founder of Instagram, and I said, ‘You created a product that touches hundreds of millions of people,’” she said. “‘What do you know that these hundreds of millions of people don’t know?’ I wanted to understand that language and skill set.”
Ms. Kloss took a two-week class at the Flatiron School, a coding boot camp in Lower Manhattan where she learned to build web apps using the program Ruby. Ms. Kloss said she has always been fascinated by how things work. “I’ve always been interested in science and math,” she said. “That’s where I excelled as a student long before my modeling career.”
The next year, she started her coding scholarship program at the Flatiron School, which has since expanded to 50 camps in 25 cities, where 1,000 girls this summer can learn basic HTML/CSS, Ruby and JavaScript, virtual reality programs, gaming and even artificial intelligence.
Advertisement
“I love that they’re taking their experiences as 15-year-old girls in America and translating them into actual projects,” Ms. Kloss said. “They’re going to build the algorithms of our future because they have different life perspectives of the world.”
Ms. Kloss has a worldly perspective herself. A full-time model, she is on the road for much of the year. “Yesterday I woke up in Paris, and today I woke up in New York,” she said.
Her closest friends include Taylor Swift. They have vacationed together and have sat courtside at a New York Knicks game. Despite internet gossip suggesting otherwise, the pair continues to be good friends and they talk frequently. “Don’t believe everything you read,” Ms. Kloss said.

She is also close with Serena Williams. They sit on the board of Oath, the Verizon subsidiary that owns AOL, Yahoo and other digital content brands. “Serena is one of the most extraordinary women on the planet,” Ms. Kloss said. “She challenges the status quo in so many ways, and I learn from her constantly.”
What has people talking, however, is Ms. Kloss’s longtime boyfriend, Joshua Kushner, 32, a venture capitalist and a founder of the health insurance start-up Oscar Health. His older brother is Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to President Trump and the husband of Ivanka Trump.
Ms. Kloss refused to comment on her relationship. “My relationship has nothing to do with this interview,” she said.
But she has not been shy about sharing her political views on Instagram. She recently posted an image for March for Our Lives, a protest against gun violence planned by teenage survivors of a Florida high school shooting, as well as a photo from the 2018 Women’s March. On Election Day 2016, she posted a photo of herself voting with the hashtag #ImWithHer.
Joshua Kushner’s Instagram feed is less overtly political, but he reportedly donated $50,000 to March for Our Lives.

After the girls’ introductions, the campers made their way to a small room and assembled on a beige couch. They gathered to record a 45-second video, shot on a smartphone, to invite girls to apply for this summer’s camp.
“I have to do this type of stuff all the time, and I always get nervous,” Ms. Kloss said. “We’ll do as many takes as we need.”
The group did a few sequences, with each girl flubbing a line and breaking into nervous laughter. Ms. Kloss extended a swanlike arm to create the perfect selfie angle, and tapped record.
“You know that feeling when you’ve got all your girls by your side and you feel like anything’s possible?” Ms. Kloss said into her iPhone. “Well that’s me right now.”

SAN FRANCISCO — There is little doubt that the Defense Department needs help from Silicon Valley’s biggest companies as it pursues work on artificial intelligence. The question is whether the people who work at those companies are willing to cooperate.
On Thursday, Robert O. Work, a former deputy secretary of defense, announced that he is teaming up with the Center for a New American Security, an influential Washington think tank that specializes in national security, to create a task force of former government officials, academics and representatives from private industry. Their goal is to explore how the federal government should embrace A.I. technology and work better with big tech companies and other organizations.
There is a growing sense of urgency to the question of what the United States is doing in artificial intelligence. China has vowed to become the world’s leader in A.I. by 2030, committing billions of dollars to the effort. Like many other officials from government and industry, Mr. Work believes the United States risks falling behind.
“The question is, how should the United States respond to this challenge?” he said. “This is a Sputnik moment.”

The military and intelligence communities have long played a big role in the technology industry and had close ties with many of Silicon Valley’s early tech giants. David Packard, Hewlett-Packard’s co-founder, even served as the deputy secretary of defense under President Richard M. Nixon.

But those relations have soured in recent years — at least with the rank and file of some better-known companies. In 2013, documents leaked by the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services, including monitoring the users of several large internet companies.
Two years ago, that antagonism grew worse after the F.B.I. demanded that Apple create special software to help it gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a gunman involved in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.
“In the wake of Edward Snowden, there has been a lot of concern over what it would mean for Silicon Valley companies to work with the national security community,” said Gregory Allen, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security. “These companies are — understandably — very cautious about these relationships.”
The Pentagon needs help on A.I. from Silicon Valley because that’s where the talent is. The tech industry’s biggest companies have been hoarding A.I. expertise, sometimes offering multimillion-dollar pay packages that the government could never hope to match.
Mr. Work was the driving force behind the creation of Project Maven, the Defense Department’s sweeping effort to embrace artificial intelligence. His new task force will include Terah Lyons, the executive director of the Partnership on AI, an industry group that includes many of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies.
Mr. Work will lead the 18-member task force with Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Moore has warned that too much of the country’s computer science talent is going to work at America’s largest internet companies.
With tech companies gobbling up all that talent, who will train the next generation of A.I. experts? Who will lead government efforts?

“Even if the U.S. does have the best A.I. companies, it is not clear they are going to be involved in national security in a substantive way,” Mr. Allen said.
Google illustrates the challenges that big internet companies face in working more closely with the Pentagon. Google’s former executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, who is still a member of the board of directors of its parent company, Alphabet, also leads the Defense Innovation Board, a federal advisory committee that recommends closer collaboration with industry on A.I. technologies.
Last week, two news outlets revealed that the Defense Department had been working with Google in developing A.I. technology that can analyze aerial footage captured by flying drones. The effort was part of Project Maven, led by Mr. Work. Some employees were angered that the company was contributing to military work.
Google runs two of the best A.I. research labs in the world — Google Brain in California and DeepMind in London.

Top researchers inside both Google A.I. labs have expressed concern over the use of A.I. by the military. When Google acquired DeepMind, the company agreed to set up an internal board that would help ensure that the lab’s technology was used in an ethical way. And one of the lab’s founders, Demis Hassabis, has explicitly said its A.I. would not be used for military purposes.
Google acknowledged in a statement that the military use of A.I. “raises valid concerns” and said it was working on policies around the use of its so-called machine learning technologies.
Among A.I. researchers and other technologists, there is widespread fear that today’s machine learning techniques could put too much power in dangerous hands. A recent report from prominent labs and think tanks in both the United States and Britain detailed the risks, including problems with weapons and surveillance equipment.
Google said it was working with the Defense Department to build technology for “non-offensive uses only.” And Mr. Work said the government explored many technologies that did not involve “lethal force.” But it is unclear where Google and other top internet companies will draw the line.
“This is a conversation we have to have,” Mr. Work said.

In August, a petrochemical company with a plant in Saudi Arabia was hit by a new kind of cyberassault. The attack was not designed to simply destroy data or shut down the plant, investigators believe. It was meant to sabotage the firm’s operations and trigger an explosion.
The attack was a dangerous escalation in international hacking, as faceless enemies demonstrated both the drive and the ability to inflict serious physical damage. And United States government officials, their allies and cybersecurity researchers worry that the culprits could replicate it in other countries, since thousands of industrial plants all over the world rely on the same American-engineered computer systems that were compromised.
Investigators have been tight-lipped about the August attack. They still won’t identify the company or the country where it is based and have not identified the culprits.
But the attackers were sophisticated and had plenty of time and resources, an indication that they were most likely supported by a government, according to more than a dozen people, including cybersecurity experts who have looked into the attack and asked not to be identified because of the confidentiality of the continuing investigation.

The only thing that prevented an explosion was a mistake in the attackers’ computer code, the investigators said.

The assault was the most alarming in a string of hacking attacks on petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia. In January 2017, computers went dark at the National Industrialization Company, Tasnee for short, which is one of the few privately owned Saudi petrochemical companies. Computers also crashed 15 miles away at Sadara Chemical Company, a joint venture between the oil and chemical giants Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical.
Within minutes of the attack at Tasnee, the hard drives inside the company’s computers were destroyed and their data wiped clean, replaced with an image of Alan Kurdi, the small Syrian child who drowned off the coast of Turkey during his family’s attempt to flee that country’s civil war.
The intent of the January attacks, Tasnee officials and researchers at the security company Symantec believe, was to inflict lasting damage on the petrochemical companies and send a political message. Recovery took months.
Energy experts said the August attack could have been an attempt to complicate  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to encourage foreign and domestic private investment to diversify the Saudi economy and produce jobs for the country’s growing youth population.
“Not only is it an attack on the private sector, which is being touted to help promote growth in the Saudi economy, but it is also focused on the petrochemical sector, which is a core part of the Saudi economy,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on Middle East energy at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Saudi Arabia has cut oil exports in recent years to support global oil prices, a strategy central to its efforts to make a potential public offering of shares of government-controlled Saudi Aramco more attractive to international investors. The kingdom has tried to compensate for its lost revenue by expanding its petrochemical and refining industry.
Some technical details of the attack in August have been previously reported, but this is the first time the earlier attacks on Tasnee and other Saudi petrochemical companies have been reported.

Security analysts at Mandiant, a division of the security firm FireEye, are still investigating what happened in August, with the help of several companies in the United States that investigate cyberattacks on industrial control systems.
A team at Schneider Electric, which made the industrial systems that were targeted, called Triconex safety controllers, is also looking into the attack, the people who spoke to The Times said. So are the National Security Agency, the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has been supporting research into forensic tools designed to assist hacking investigations.
All of the investigators believe the attack was most likely intended to cause an explosion that would have killed people. In the last few years, explosions at petrochemical plants in China and Mexico — though not triggered by hackers — have killed several employees, injured hundreds and forced evacuations of surrounding communities.
What worries investigators and intelligence analysts the most is that the attackers compromised Schneider’s Triconex controllers, which keep equipment operating safely by performing tasks like regulating voltage, pressure and temperatures. Those controllers are used in about 18,000 plants around the world, including nuclear and water treatment facilities, oil and gas refineries, and chemical plants.
“If attackers developed a technique against Schneider equipment in Saudi Arabia, they could very well deploy the same technique here in the United States,” said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
The Triconex system was believed to be a “lock and key operation.” In other words, the safety controllers could be tweaked or dismantled only with physical contact.

So how did the hackers get in? Investigators found an odd digital file in a computer at an engineering workstation that looked like a legitimate part of the Schneider controllers but was designed to sabotage the system. Investigators will not say how it got there, but they do not believe it was an inside job. This was the first time these systems were sabotaged remotely.
The only thing that prevented significant damage was a bug in the attackers’ computer code that inadvertently shut down the plant’s production systems.

Investigators believe that the hackers have probably fixed their mistake by now, and that it is only a matter of time before they deploy the same technique against another industrial control system. A different group could also use those tools for its own attack.
The August attack was also a significant step up from earlier attacks in Saudi Arabia. Starting on Nov. 17, 2016, computer screens at a number of Saudi government computers went dark and their hard drives were erased, according to researchers at Symantec, which investigated the attacks.
Two weeks later, the same attackers hit other Saudi targets with the same computer virus. On Jan. 23, 2017, they struck again, at Tasnee and other petrochemical firms, deploying a computer virus known as Shamoon, after a word embedded in its code.
The Shamoon virus first surfaced five years earlier at Saudi Aramco, wiping out tens of thousands of computers and replacing the data with a partial image of a burning American flag. Leon E. Panetta, the United States defense secretary at the time, said the attack could be a harbinger.
“An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,” he said.
Government officials and cybersecurity experts in Saudi Arabia and the United States attributed the 2012 Shamoon attack to Iranian hackers.
“Another attacker could have adopted that code” for the January 2017 attacks, said Vikram Thakur, a senior researcher at Symantec, “but our analysis showed the likelihood it was the same perpetrator was pretty high.”
The attack in August was not a Shamoon attack. It was much more dangerous.
Investigators believe a nation-state was responsible because there was no obvious profit motive, even though the attack would have required significant financial resources. And the computer code had not been seen in any earlier assaults. Every hacking tool had been custom built.
Advertisement
The attackers not only had to figure out how to get into that system, they had to understand its design well enough to know the layout of the facility — what pipes went where and which valves to turn in order to trigger an explosion.
Investigators believe someone would have had to buy the same version of the Triconex safety system to figure out how it worked. The components, investigators said, could be purchased for $40,000 on eBay.
The attack has also shown the challenge of attributing with unquestionable evidence an attack to one country.
Security experts said Iran, China, Russia the United States and Israel had the technical sophistication to launch such attacks. But most of those countries had no motivation to do so. China and Russia are increasingly making energy deals with Saudi Arabia, and Israel and the United States have moved to cooperate with the kingdom against Iran.
That leaves Iran, which experts said had a growing military hacking program, although the Iranian government has denied any involvement in such attacks.
Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have steadily escalated in recent years, and the conflict has drifted online.
United States officials and security analysts blamed Iranian hackers for a spate of attacks on American banks in 2012 and more recent espionage attacks on the airline industry. Iranian hackers were blamed for the 2012 Aramco attack and are also the leading suspects in the more recent Shamoon attacks.
The August attack was far more sophisticated than any previous attack originating from Iran, Mr. Thakur of Symantec said, but there is a chance Iran could have improved its hacking abilities or worked with another country, like Russia or North Korea.
Tasnee said in an email that it had hired experts from Symantec and IBM to study the attack against it. The company said it had also “completely overhauled our security standards” and started using new tools to prevent attacks.

“Being a global business,” the company said, “we believe that cybersecurity is a concern wherever you are in the world.”

SAN FRANCISCO — The ride-hailing service Lyft has agreed to alliances with just about anyone working on driverless car technology. Its latest partnership aims to make its autonomous vehicle technology available to any car manufacturer.
Lyft said Wednesday that it had reached a deal with Magna International, one of the world’s biggest auto suppliers, to jointly develop and manufacture self-driving car systems.
The companies said they will work together to introduce autonomous vehicles to Lyft’s ride-hailing network. At the same time, Magna can sell the driverless-car technology to any customer — including other technology companies.
Magna also said it would invest $200 million in Lyft’s latest fund-raising round, lifting the San Francisco-based company’s valuation to $11.7 billion.

The partnership reflects Lyft’s open-arms approach to autonomous vehicles.
Lyft has opened its ride-hailing network to other companies working on self-driving cars, including Ford and General Motors, a major Lyft investor, so they can gain real-world experience by picking up passengers and collecting data.
Advertisement
Uber, Lyft’s main rival, has been developing self-driving technology mostly on its own. Waymo, a Lyft partner, is slowly introducing its own ride-hailing service using autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans equipped with Waymo’s own hardware and software.
The hype over self-driving cars has made development of the technology challenging for some traditional automakers. Car companies face huge salaries for top artificial intelligence engineers and limited access to data and key components. The competitive landscape is so charged that it has already given birth to at least one high-profile lawsuit.
As a result, automakers are confronting a choice: Pay big for a technology start-up or risk falling behind. Last year, Ford announced it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. GM acquired Cruise for an estimated $1 billion in cash, stock and incentive packages in 2016, the same year it invested $500 million in Lyft.
After lagging behind Uber, Lyft has recently made a concerted push into self-driving cars. The company opened a research facility in Palo Alto, Calif., and has aggressively recruited engineers.
It also has a major asset for self-driving technology — a ride-hailing network picking up and dropping off passengers 10 million times a week. This provides Lyft with a customer base to introduce and test the vehicles and a way to collect information that can be used to “train” autonomous cars.
But Raj Kapoor, Lyft’s chief strategy officer, said it would be a few years before truly autonomous vehicles were ready for the road.

“I believe this relationship will get us there faster,” Mr. Kapoor said.
Magna, a Canadian auto parts maker, already supplies a wide range of driver-assist technology to its customers, including a system for staying in lanes, automatic emergency braking and rearview cameras. It also builds entire vehicles for customers like Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar — a capability that has made the company a potential partner for a new entrant like Apple.
Magna has already been working on hardware for self-driving cars, including radar and lidar — an abbreviation for light detection and ranging — that help the vehicles see the world around them.

But Magna said the partnership with Lyft would be essential to helping it push further into autonomous vehicles, combining its automotive and manufacturing experience with Lyft’s ride network to better understand the many situations that a self-driving car will encounter.
“The question isn’t whether autonomous vehicles are going to happen but how long the transition is,” said Swamy Kotagiri, Magna’s chief technology officer.
Under the partnership, Lyft would take the lead in developing self-driving car technology while Magna would oversee manufacturing of the systems. The two companies would share the development costs and the resulting intellectual property.
Lyft compared its strategy of operating its own self-driving cars as well as welcoming driverless cars from other companies to the way Amazon is both a retailer selling products to customers directly and an online virtual mall, providing space for other companies to sell goods on the site.

THE SHIFT
MARCH 14, 2018

Several years ago, a plastic figurine began appearing around Google’s offices, an aging alien with gray hair, a Google Glass headset and a sign that read, “Get Off My Lawn!”
The doll, a special edition of Google’s Android mascot, was a jokey tribute to the Greyglers, a group for the 40-and-over crowd at Google, and the doll hinted at how it felt to be an older worker in tech: funny, self-conscious, a little out of place.
The Greyglers still exist, but they’re no longer such an anomaly. Sundar Pichai, Google’s 45-year-old chief executive, would fit in the group. So would Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded the search engine as graduate students two decades ago; Susan Wojcicki, an early employee who runs YouTube; and most of the company’s other high-ranking executives.
For years, the self-appointed leaders of Silicon Valley were young people — mostly men — with age-appropriate behavior. They adopted brash mottos like “move fast and break things” and eschewed work-life balance in favor of all-night hacking sessions in offices that looked more like college dorms. Their successes were cheered, and their sins were shrugged off as the cost of innovation.
Advertisement
“Young people are just smarter,” Mark Zuckerberg crowed back in 2007, when he was the 22-year-old wunderkind behind a fledgling social network.
Advertisement
Now, of course, Facebook is a global powerhouse, and the company’s pursuit of growth at all costs has led to some truly dire consequences around the world and fueled a larger backlash against tech. At the same time, Mr. Zuckerberg has disproved his own theory. Now 33, he is still not old by any measure (except perhaps his own). But he is a smarter and more self-aware leader than he was a decade ago, and he has shown more willingness to accept responsibility for the company’s mistakes. After years of moving fast and breaking things, Facebook is at least acknowledging its flaws and trying, albeit clumsily, to fix them. That’s a start.
There’s a lot of growing up happening in today’s tech industry, where former whiz kids made their fortunes and are now settling down, starting families and starting to think about their legacies. Tech’s work force remains young — according to PayScale, the median employee at the five largest tech companies is around 30, roughly a decade younger than the median American worker — but the industry’s leaders have gotten older, and are seemingly more attuned to the power they wield.
“Five years ago, there was no talk of empathy or moral responsibility,” said Om Malik, a venture capitalist who has written about the tech industry for years.
Certain corners of the start-up world, such as cryptocurrency ventures, are still filled with reckless renegades. But the industry’s largest companies are now mature, bureaucratic businesses whose daily decisions are heavily scrutinized. That’s a good thing, since the issues many of these companies now face — global information wars, regulation and privacy concerns, diversity and sexual harassment challenges, and worries about technology’s effects on billions of people’s brains — will require thoughtful, grown-up solutions.
In recent weeks, I spoke to numerous industry insiders about this coming of age. Here’s what I learned.
Tech leaders are becoming more realistic and introspective.
Gregor Hochmuth, 33, an early engineer at Instagram, said some of today’s internet giants had grown up with positive-thinking cultures that left them vulnerable to abuse.
“The idea that a product could make your life worse was not in anyone’s perception,” said Mr. Hochmuth, who left Instagram in 2014.
Advertisement
That perspective helps explain the shock many founders felt when the internet grew into the foundation of global culture and commerce, and products they had built as quirky experiments became pieces of critical infrastructure.
“No one was thinking about ‘Wow, in 15 years, billions of people are going to be using this site every day,’” said Andrew McCollum, 34, one of Facebook’s founders, who left the company in 2006 and is now the chief executive of Philo, an internet TV company. “The goal was ‘How do we create something great?’ — not ‘What’s our plan for world domination?’”
Twitter, another company started by young idealists, is the latest tech giant to put itself under the microscope. In a series of tweets early this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, said the company was trying to improve the health and civility of its platform after years of neglect.
“We didn’t fully predict or understand the real-world negative consequences,” Mr. Dorsey, 41, wrote. “We acknowledge that now, and are determined to find holistic and fair solutions.”
You could chalk these statements up to self-interest. But Maureen Taylor, a leadership communication expert who frequently coaches tech executives, said this kind of earnest self-examination was becoming more frequent among founders.
“As you get older, you realize your responsibilities are bigger,” she said. “People are becoming very thoughtful about the ramifications of technology, and remembering that the whole point was to make the world a better place.”
Their new outlook is making them more protective and risk-averse.
The tech industry’s stereotypical accessory used to be the hoodie. Today, it might as well be the Baby Bjorn. There are a lot of new parents among tech elites, including Mr. Zuckerberg and Kevin Systrom, 34, a co-founder of Instagram. (Evan Spiegel, the 27-year-old chief executive of Snap, is expecting his first child this year.) And parenthood seems to be shaping their attitudes. In an interview with The New York Times this year, Mr. Zuckerberg cited his children as one of the reasons he was so focused on fixing Facebook.

“It’s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.
Advertisement
Chamath Palihapitiya, 41, an early Facebook executive who now leads the venture capital firm Social Capital, told me that becoming a father had transformed his outlook on technology. He avoids screen time for his children, and is more wary of the tools he helped build.
“Before fatherhood, I believed that enabling my children to grow and explore through technology would be an obvious edge and something I’d support,” Mr. Palihapitiya said. “Increasingly, what I see is a detached generation of kids living behind screens.”
As their executives pursue personal growth, some of Silicon Valley’s large companies are also professionalizing their workplaces by cutting back on frivolous perks and enforcing stricter rules on sexual harassment and other forms of employee misconduct. (You could call this the “Uber effect.”)
Industries run by older executives aren’t necessarily paragons of virtue, either. (See: Wall Street.) But there is something to be said for caution, and tech companies now seem aware that they’re playing with live ammunition.
“You become more responsible when you have more to lose,” Mr. Malik said.
It also may make their companies more vulnerable.
Silicon Valley works a bit like a forest — as old trees decay and die, they decompose and fertilize the next generation of growth. And today’s largest tech companies are beginning to show their age. Facebook is 14 years old, and Twitter is 12. Google, at 20, is now nearly as old as Microsoft was in 1998, when Google was started.
The tech industry’s maturity may be a sign of cyclical renewal. Fifteen years ago, Larry Ellison — the billionaire co-founder of Oracle, and the enfant terrible of an earlier generation of tech moguls — denounced what he saw as Silicon Valley’s slow-footed stagnation. (The tech industry was “as large as it’s going to be,” he predicted.)
Mr. Ellison was wrong, of course. Tech wasn’t stagnant, but the generation of mature companies that included Oracle was on its way to being eclipsed by newer and scrappier ventures.
If history is any indication, that cycle will repeat itself and a new crop of young tech leaders will emerge. But hopefully they’ll learn from the mistakes made by their predecessors. Technology is too important now, and we can’t afford another generation of naïveté.

SAN FRANCISCO — Google is joining Facebook in banning advertising for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Google, the largest provider of digital advertising on the internet, announced on Tuesday that it plans to change its advertising policy for certain financial services, including cryptocurrencies, starting in June. The new restriction would apply both to space on Google’s platforms, like YouTube, and to third-party websites where Google sells advertising space.
Facebook announced in January that it would ban all ads for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in order to stop misleading and deceptive promotions. Together, Google and Facebook account for the majority of advertising on the internet in terms of revenue.
The short announcement on Google’s advertising policies page did not specify why Google planned to turn away that advertising. The company said the ban also applied to content related to cryptocurrencies “including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets and cryptocurrency trading advice.”

The frenzy around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about scammers using online advertisements to recruit potential marks enticed by the surge in prices for most virtual currencies. Advertising for new virtual currencies exploded late last year when prices jumped.

Some of that activity drew skepticism from regulators. Many start-ups sold their own custom virtual currencies in so-called initial coin offerings, which became a popular way to raise money to fund new software projects. Online advertising was a popular way to market the coins to new customers.
In recent months, American regulators have made it clear that many of the coin offerings were most likely illegal. That has pushed down the prices of most virtual currencies and dampened the market for the ads.

The restrictions on cryptocurrency advertising are similar to limits Google places on other forms of ads, including the promotion of counterfeit items or sexually explicit content.

When your laptop is lost or stolen, you aren’t just out $800 (or more). Your personal information is also accessible to whoever takes it, even if you have a password.
“Unfortunately, a typical password-protected user account does nothing to protect your data,” says Dennis Stewart, a security engineer at CipherTechs. “While the password will prevent someone else from logging into your computer, an attacker can still use other methods to copy files off.” If thieves remove the hard drive and put it into another computer, they have access to any files you have stored on it. In some cases, they can even reset the password on your PC and gain access to your email, passwords and other personal information.
Thankfully, you can protect your data against both of these types of attacks with encryption. “Encryption is a mathematical process used to jumble up data. If important files or whole devices are encrypted, there is no way to make sense of them without the key,” Mr. Stewart said. That means if thieves try to access your information, they’ll find only a jumbled mess unless they have your password, and they won’t be able to simply reset that password if the device is encrypted.
Encrypting your hard drive isn’t some super-technical process that only security experts can perform, either — anyone can do it on his or her computer at home, and it should take only a few minutes to get up and running.
Advertisement
If you have a Windows laptop, you have a few options. Some Windows 10 devices come with encryption turned on by default, and you can check this by going to Settings > System > About and scrolling down to “Device Encryption.” You’ll need to log into Windows with a Microsoft account in order for this feature to work, but if your laptop offers it, it’s an easy and free way to protect your data.
A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

If your laptop doesn’t support Device Encryption, you can use Windows’ other built-in encryption tool: BitLocker. BitLocker is available only on Professional versions of Windows and above (a $99 upgrade for Home edition users), but it’s incredibly easy to set up. Just head to Windows’ Control Panel > System and Security > Manage BitLocker. Select your operating system drive and click the “Turn On BitLocker” button, following the prompts to create a password that will function as your encryption key. Be sure to store your BitLocker key in a safe place — somewhere not on that computer — in case something goes wrong!
Advertisement
If neither of those is an option, a free program called VeraCrypt can encrypt your entire hard drive, requiring your password when you boot your computer. It’s not quite as simple, straightforward and built-in as Windows’ Device Encryption and BitLocker, but if it’s your only option, it’s worth looking into.
Mac laptops are much more straightforward: All modern Macs (since about 2003) have a feature called FileVault that encrypts your entire system drive. Just open your Mac’s System Preferences, head to Security & Privacy and select the FileVault tab. Click the “Turn On FileVault” button to create a password and begin the encryption process. Store your key in a safe place (not on that computer) in case you ever get locked out.
Thankfully, modern iPhones and Android phones will automatically encrypt your data as long as you use a PIN or password, so you need to worry about enabling the feature only on your desktop and laptop computers. If you have an Android phone with an SD card, however, you can enable encryption for the SD card manually from the Lock Screen and Security settings.
There is one catch to encryption: Your password is much, much more important to remember. Data may be protected from intruders, but it’s also impossible for you to access should you forget your password or recovery key. “If a user forgets or loses their key, they’re out of luck,” says Mr. Stewart. “If a bad actor can’t get at your data without the key, you can’t, either.” Some businesses may grant IT departments a master key, but not all do, and this can’t be done retroactively.
So if you’re the type of person who forgets passwords often, it’s incredibly important you write it down — along with the recovery key you were given when you performed the above steps — and keep it in a safe place. Don’t keep it on the computer you encrypted and don’t keep it out in plain sight — put it in a physical safe that only you can access. And no matter what, always keep a good backup of your data, either on another hard drive (which you should also encrypt) or with a cloud service like Backblaze that keeps your data secure.

In a sunny office in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Mike Schmidt spends his time ferreting out fake Instagram accounts.
Some are obvious, like the one that had never posted a photo and lacked a profile picture yet followed about 7,500 accounts — the maximum allowed by the social media site. Others are trickier. Mr. Schmidt had to scroll down a little on an account with the name @ailebnoblk before the same stock image of a car showed up three times in a row, a clue that there was no real person behind the profile.
“The amount of bot activity that’s happening on these platforms is pretty insane,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Just the amount of new accounts and times these folks are liking and commenting with spam and positive comments and happy-face emojis.”
Dovetale, a four-person software company Mr. Schmidt co-founded in 2016, has devised a range of tactics to identify large numbers of fake accounts that follow popular Instagram personalities. It then packages that information for marketers, who are increasingly skeptical of the audience numbers that often determine how much money social media stars can command from advertisers.
Marketers are flocking to businesses like Dovetale, prompted by revelations like those in a recent investigation by The New York Times that detailed the booming industry of people buying fake followers and fraudulent engagement on Twitter and other social media sites. Some of these fake accounts, in an attempt to seem legitimate, use personal information from real people without their knowledge. That has provoked concern among brands and their agencies, which often rely on metrics like the number of followers an account has when hiring people on YouTube and Instagram to promote their products. These social media stars can often fetch thousands of dollars for one post promoting a product.
“We knew this kind of day of reckoning would come,” said Erick Schwab, the co-founder of Sylo, which vets influencers for fraud and aims to assign a numerical score to their content akin to a Nielsen rating. “We’ve gotten tons of brands, agencies, vendors emailing us, who we’ve been having conversations with for a while, but now they’re sort of like, this is being demanded.”
Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, which connects brands with influencers, has seen a surge in requests for fraud detection from agencies. “Everyone is definitely scrambling because they don’t want to be held responsible,” he said.
The interest in such firms reflects how easy it is to fake popularity on platforms like Instagram, where bots seem to run unchecked even on accounts where people have not paid for them. While many advertisers have become aware of this, and tried to place more emphasis on content quality or favorable comments, follower numbers still tend to loom large.
“Even though brands are looking for engagement more, the actual pay and compensation that influencers are getting is still based on the follower number,” said Alivia Latimer, a photographer with about 102,000 Instagram followers. Ms. Latimer, who has worked with brands including Lush Cosmetics and Hollister, said that she charged about $1,200 for a branded post. She added that she knew people with two million followers who charge $40,000 per post.
That means new kinds of detective work are needed for brands that still want the endorsements of the young and hip online. Dovetale said it uses more than 50 metrics to analyze the Instagram followers of popular accounts, including the language in the bios, the rate at which they hit “like” and “follow,” and their country of origin. (An influencer with a high number of followers from Turkey, Brazil and China, for instance, can raise red flags for Dovetale, which has frequently seen fake followers come from those countries.)
The clues can be complex. Dovetale flagged one account that claimed to be someone named Meg Cragle because it was part of a group of profiles that had made one or two unrelated posts and contained similarly worded bios of exactly 99 characters that ended with ellipses. The discovery was reinforced by a Google search for phrases in the account’s bio like “award-winning bacon fanatic,” which matched the terms in a now-deleted Twitter bio generator online.
Dovetale acknowledged that its methods were not foolproof, but they are valuable enough in a murky landscape that the agency 360i said it was now unlikely to hire influencers for campaigns if Dovetale’s database said more than 2 to 3 percent of their followers were bots. Dovetale said that, on average, 16.4 percent of the followers on Instagram’s top 20 accounts were fraudulent.
Sylo, which requires influencers to share access to their public and private post statistics, said it had rejected 77 percent of influencers who have tried to register on its platform after their accounts showed issues like abnormal spikes in engagement on posts or a large number of generic, emoji-laden comments that bots are known for.
“In the absence of direct pressure on the platforms, it’s a way for advertisers to take more control of their own spend and not be at the mercy of the platforms themselves,” said Jeff Semones, head of social media at MediaCom, which has recommended Sylo to clients. While he said Instagram had removed many accounts that were flagrantly violating its terms and conditions, “a lot of one-off activity goes unchecked.”
A spokeswoman for Instagram said that the platform’s “internal estimates show that spam accounts make up a small fraction” of Instagram’s 800 million monthly users.
Some believe that the new awareness around bots highlights the misguided expectations that marketers have for how many people they can reach through influencers.
Changes to algorithms on Facebook and Instagram have significantly reduced the number of people who will see a person’s posts without paid promotion. And unless advertisers are paying Instagram for the information, they typically have to rely on screenshots from influencers for data on how many people saw a post. Influencers like Ms. Latimer said that even then, not all brands request those screenshots.
Tyler Stark, director of marketing at Traeger Grills, said that many influencers, particularly on Facebook, reach only 2 percent of their audience. That has made smaller influencers more appealing and put a focus on engagement, he said, with the thought that a post with a large number of likes and comments will end up in the feeds of more people.
Still, Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said that he recently heard a major retailer recommend that brands work only with influencers who have at least 200,000 followers.
“Most brands would say that a follower is someone who’s definitely going to see the post,” Mr. Gilbreath said. “Not only are most people not seeing the posts even if they’re real people, but many of them are not real people.”
Soapbox Influencer Marketing, a company that connects brands with influencers, features a case study on its website for a new hummus from Bush’s Beans. The site claims that the campaign, which featured 519 influencer posts, resulted in a whopping 891 million impressions — nearly triple the American population.
When asked about the figure, Beth Stephens, the company’s president, said it was “incorrectly listed on our website and needs to be corrected.” She added that Bush’s Beans also worked with “a number of other influence and social service providers,” making it difficult for Soapbox to directly assess the figure. Bush’s Beans didn’t return requests for comment.
Others tout the “total reach” of fashion and food influencers on their websites. In other types of media and Instagram’s own business analytics, “reach” refers to the number of different people who actually saw an ad. But in influencer marketing, it often refers to an aggregation of followers across platforms and can even include monthly unique visitors to blogs.
Mr. Gilbreath is still a proponent of the work that comes out of social media mavens, but has instead focused on hiring creative “micro” influencers with 10,000 or more followers. The firm pays to promote their recipes or tips and tracks subsequent visits to their websites, he said, adding that the data is otherwise too unreliable.
Corey Martin, head of influencer marketing at 360i, said that the agency was increasingly paying Instagram to promote posts from influencers, which allows the agency to “track and trace consumer behavior in a way we previously hadn’t.”
Some hope for more action from Instagram, especially since it plans to restrict access to some of its data later this year, which may impede the work of bot-hunters like Dovetale.
“It will be unfair until Instagram really just cleans out the bots and the lurkers,” said Caitlin Sakdalan, who runs the account @BeFatBeHappy. “There’s so many different programs that people use and algorithms and we can all say this and all say that, but until Instagram itself kind of does it for the community, I think it will be an unfair playing field.”

A. Keeping deceptive and malicious apps out of online stores in a continuing battle for Google, as it is for Apple, Microsoft and other companies that invite outside developers to create and sell applications through official channels. Scammers have recently added new tactics to get their wares onto devices, like hiding code in flashlight and utility apps and releasing “multistage” malware that shows no initial security threat — but gradually updates itself with more sinister software once it is installed.
Last year, Google announced a new security service for Android devices called Google Play Protect, which tries to thwart more malicious activity. Google Play Protect scans apps for safety before you download them to your device and then scans the apps on your device for malware to warn you of any security concerns. Newer forms of malicious software were originally able to evade detection, but after third-party security researchers notified the company of the deceptive apps, Google used its Play Protect software to remotely remove the malware from devices.
You can see the Google Play Protect settings on your device by opening the Google Play store icon, tapping the menu button in the upper-left corner and selecting Play Protect. The Play Protect screen shows the apps that Google has scanned recently for security issues and includes controls for disabling the scans after apps have been downloaded.

Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World

Throughout U.S. history, marriage has been tied to religion and religious institutions. Today, virtually all faith traditions have rules and ceremonies regarding marriage and, in the United States as well as in many other countries, clergy of different religious groups are authorized by the government to perform weddings.
In the U.S., roughly half of all American adults (48%) say they are married, according to the 2014 Religious Landscape Study. Much smaller shares of U.S. adults say they are living with a partner (7%), are divorced or separated (13%), or are widowed (7%). A quarter of Americans say they’ve never been married.

In certain U.S. religious groups, a higher-than-average share of adults say they are married. For instance, six-in-ten or more Mormons, members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America are married. The same holds true for Hindus, Southern Baptists and members of the Episcopal Church.
By contrast, fewer than four-in-ten atheists, agnostics and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” are married. Similarly, Buddhists (39%) also are less likely than the general public to be married.
Religious groups whose share of married adults is comparable to shares seen in the general population include Catholics (52%) and Orthodox Christians (48%).
Of course, there are many factors associated with marriage rates. For instance, Americans who have a college education are more likely than those with less education to be married.
Age also is a big factor in determining which religious groups have a higher or lower share of married adults. In short, those groups that have more young people tend to have a smaller share of married adults and vice versa. That’s in part because younger Americans are less likely than their older counterparts to be married. In fact, among adults between the ages of 18 and 29, just 16% are married, compared with a majority (57%) of adults over the age of 30.
Atheists and other religiously unaffiliated adults are a case in point. The median age of atheists is 34, much younger than the median age of the population as a whole (46 in the 2014 Landscape Study). And while only 8% of the youngest atheists (those under age 30) are married, 54% of those 30 and older have a husband or wife. A similar relationship between age and marriage exists among agnostics and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular.” And the same holds true among members of most other religious traditions analyzed in the Landscape Study.
But the survey shows that even after age is taken into account, there are still significant differences in the share of married adults across religious groups. Even when the analysis is restricted to adults over the age of 30, self-identified atheists, agnostics and those whose religion is nothing in particular are still somewhat less likely than Mormons, Jews, evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants and Catholics to be married.

“The Good Place” stars Kristen Bell and Ted Danson.
 
NBC’s comedy The Good Place is that rare combination: it is 1) smart; 2) hilarious; and 3) getting robust ratings. (Please don’t let me jinx things by openly praising it; it’s happened before that just as soon as I discover a show, the Powers That Be cancel it post haste. It’s hard not to feel personally responsible. RIP Veronica Mars, Firefly, etc.)
The show, starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, begins when Eleanor Shellstrop (Bell) opens her eyes after dying and discovers to her relief that she’s been sent to “The Good Place.” There Eleanor finds lovely neighborhoods with individually tailored homes and an abundance of frozen yogurt shops, because OF COURSE.
The problem? She’s pretty sure there’s been a mistake. So she tries to hide her true identity from the resident bureaucrat-cum-archangel Michael (a bowtie-rocking Danson) while she takes a crash course in how to be a better person.
This is an entertaining and surprisingly thoughtful show for just about everybody, but Mormons in particular may appreciate a few of its key points.
Tired of adopting your fake curse words from Napoleon Dynamite, which is so 2004? Eager to beef up your alt-vocab with some Mormon-approved sauciness? Look no further than The Good Place, where Eleanor can no longer swear but gamely keeps on trying. The parameters of heaven just won’t quite let her get away with that kind of language, which she thinks is a load of bullshirt.
In the show’s calculus, every action yields a positive or negative value that affects a person’s eternal destiny, whether it’s gaining .54 points for singing to a child or losing 53.83 for disturbing a coral reef with your flipper. You can gain points for purifying the water source for a whole village (+277) or lose it all and then some for sexual harassment (–731.26). Moral actions make a difference—an approach that Mormons will find familiar.
On the other hand, as we learn through the series as it progresses, those good works also aren’t enough.
(In the spirit of my own eventual reckoning, I am not revealing any spoilers about how these various elements play out over time, including the awesome what-the-fork plot twist at the end of season 1. Depriving others of their own enjoyment of the show would result in a -7846.29 deficit in my eternal arithmetic, and that’s a risk I cannot afford.)

Mormons are very into the idea of a two-by-two heaven, and The Good Place does not disappoint. Everyone finds their soulmate there, at least in theory. What’s vastly different from Mormonism is that no one seems to have had those relationships (or any prior relationships, weirdly) before arriving at the Good Place.
It’s what Mormons always knew, right? Everything you learned and did here is portable to that magical afterlife.
Chidi, Eleanor’s assigned soulmate, was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy in life. So who better to tutor Eleanor in the finer points of rudimentary moral behavior as she tries to become a person who deserves residence in the Good Place? Good thing he remembers everything he ever knew–and that he brought all his books with him.
One of the neatest things about watching the show is seeing how Eleanor grows and changes after her death. In fact, all the main characters do. Eleanor has to unlearn much of what she thought and believed in her human life, which was primarily about putting herself first. But she learns and matures, becoming more selfless, especially through her newfound friendships.
Eleanor is not a fan of the universe’s binary theology, which only appears to have a Good Place and a Bad Place. Is it really fair that a tiny fraction of the population gets ushered to the Good Place while the other 99+% are being tortured by, say, bears with two mouths down below?
“I wasn’t freakin’ Gandhi, but I was OK. I was a medium person,” Eleanor insists in the pilot episode. “I should get to spend eternity in a medium place. Like Cincinnati! Everyone who wasn’t perfect but wasn’t terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.”
The show’s binary theology makes Mormonism’s multi-tiered afterlife look better and better. In the Mormon scenario, a whole heck of a lot of us are headed for the terrestrial kingdom, and it’s actually a pretty great place to be. (Like Cincinnati, which I’m proud to say is my own city. Living in Cincinnati for all of eternity would be pretty darn great, especially now that we have Fiona the Hippo.)
Season 2 of The Good Place won’t be available on Netflix until September, which is kind of bullshirt in my opinion. That’s a purgatory of waiting. But if you absolutely can’t last that long you can buy access for $19.99 on Amazon.

Professor Stephen Hawking smiles during a news conference at the University of Potsdam, near Berlin, Germany, on July 21, 1999. Hawking, whose brilliant mind ranged across time and space though his body was paralyzed by disease, has died, a family spokesman said early Wednesday, March 14, 2018.(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)
(RNS) — Say the words “British,” “scientist” and “atheist” and the first person to come to mind probably isn’t Stephen Hawking.
But while Hawking, the theoretical physicist who died Wednesday (March 14) at age 76, was certainly overshadowed in the atheist department by his countryman, the evolutionary biologist and atheist activist Richard Dawkins, Hawking’s atheism was more of a slow simmer than Dawkins’ explosive ire.
“What could define God (is thinking of God) as the embodiment of the laws of nature. However, this is not what most people would think of that God,” Hawking told Diane Sawyer in 2010. “They made a human-like being with whom one can have a personal relationship. When you look at the vast size of the universe and how insignificant an accidental human life is in it, that seems most impossible.”
One reason Hawking’s atheism was less well-known was he seemed to fudge the question of God’s existence for years. In his 1988 seminal best-seller, “A Brief History of Time,” he wrote, “The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a certain underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired.”
Later in the book, he writes of the quest for a unifying theory of the universe: “It would be the ultimate triumph of human reason — for then we should know the mind of God.”
Some saw those statements as proof that Hawking held private religious beliefs. He fed that idea with a few statements over the years — “The laws may have been decreed by God,” he told Reuters in 2007, “but God does not intervene to break the laws” — and even titled a 2005 book “God Created the Integers.”
He also went to the Vatican and met briefly with then-Pope Benedict XVI in 2008.
Then, in 2010, with the publication of “The Grand Design,” Hawking seemed to have begun a sort of atheist striptease, slowly revealing his nonbelief:
“Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing,” he and co-author Leonard Mlodinow write. “Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.”
Within a year, Hawking said in a Discovery Channel documentary: “We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate.”
And just in case that wasn’t clear enough, Hawking dropped the last veil in a 2014 interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo.
“What I meant by ‘we would know the mind of God’ is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God. Which there isn’t. I’m an atheist.”
After his death, some atheists remarked that Hawking’s outlook on having just this one life, which was marked, for him, by debilitating Lou Gehrig’s disease, fortified their own lack of belief.
“Hawking had to aggressively face his own mortality every single day, it would have been understandable for him to abandon evidential reasoning and fall into the old adage that there are ‘no atheists in a foxhole,'” Lianna Brinded, an atheist, wrote in the online magazine Quartz. “Instead, he continued to approach his stance on religion with scientific evidence-based reasoning.”

 Religion News Service (https://religionnews.com/2018/01/02/evangelicals-surprising-view-of-science-and-what-it-may-mean/)

(RNS) — Ask fans of New Atheist scientists Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris what religious Americans think of science and there’s a good chance you’d get something to the effect of “religious people hate science.”
Yet what do we actually know about what religious Americans think about science, particularly evangelicals, who are often the implicit or explicit focus of such discussions?
Not much, it turns out.
Sure, there are loud voices that seem to feed into certain conclusions about what religious people think about science and scientists. (Consider creationist Ken Ham’s attempts to discredit the theory of evolution.) But, as with any issue, the loudest or most prominent voices are not necessarily the most representative.
Over the past five years we have conducted hundreds of interviews, visits to houses of worship and a survey of over 10,000 U.S. adults representing a wide range of religious perspectives, all with the goal of better understanding how Americans understand the relationship between religion and science. What we found does not support the conclusion that religious people are hostile toward, disinterested in or pessimistic about science.
We asked our survey respondents how they personally view the relationship between religion and science. Rather than saying that the two are in conflict, evangelicals were the most likely to say that they view religion and science as having a collaborative relationship in which the two spheres support each other (48 percent of evangelicals) or that religion and science are each independent and refer to different aspects of reality (21 percent of evangelicals).
Indeed, our in-depth interviews showed us that many evangelicals see support for their faith in science. As one evangelical we talked to said, “Science is fantastic and I thank God for this. … It isn’t as if He didn’t want us to find out about His incredible creation.”
Our research does show, though, that for evangelicals in particular, interest in science increases when they can see it connecting to concerns informed by their faith, such as serving others or alleviating suffering.
For instance, we asked survey respondents if they would recommend young people enter basic and applied science occupations such as biology or physics. Evangelicals were less likely to say they would recommend a young person pursue such careers compared with the nonreligious.
But when it came to more applied scientific occupations, such as medicine, evangelicals were just willing to recommend a career as a physician.
Of course, both career paths involve significant scientific education, but one is seen as more obviously redemptive (medicine). This provides insight into potential ways to leverage the interest and energy of evangelicals in support of science.
Our survey and interview data do highlight tensions. For example, our survey asked whether people thought “scientists should be open to considering miracles in their theories and explanations.” About 60 percent of evangelicals agree with this statement, a much higher rate of support than among people of other religions.
This makes sense given that evangelicals — and many other religious Americans –believe in a God who has been and can be involved in the world and in their lives. This starting assumption inevitably shapes how they view and interpret the scientific process and scientific claims.
Many religious Americans, though, are quite willing to try to reconcile their starting assumptions about God with any scientific claims presented to them.
For example, our interviews and survey data show that, when it comes to issues like the origins of the universe and life, religious Americans appear rather flexible in their willingness to say that different origin narratives could be true as long as they leave room for God’s role in the world, even if this role is part of their personal and private interpretation of that origin narrative.
To be clear, we are not suggesting that scientists or science classrooms can or should start talking about miracles. Nor are we saying that only applied forms of science are worthwhile. But any attempt to connect scientific and religious communities, including the evangelical community, will be more productive if it begins by shedding the stereotypes presented by the loudest voices in society, and also understanding those communities’ core interests and worldviews.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (RNS) — The trickling sound echoed through Zonnebloem Estate’s chapel as the Anglican bishop of Table Bay, the Rt. Rev. Garth Q. Counsell, slowly poured one pitcher of water into another. 
This sound of running water, once considered soothing, now triggers anxiety in drought-stricken Cape Town, where residents are hoarding bottled water and showering over buckets in anticipation of “Day Zero.” 
Currently estimated for mid-May, Day Zero would mark the unprecedented moment when engineers close most of the city’s faucets. Nearly 4 million residents would be left to fetch daily water rations of just 25 liters (6.6 gallons) from fewer than 200 central collection points until rains resume or alternative sources come online.

Government officials have provided scant details for Day Zero logistics. Rather than communicate a clear plan of action, some are invoking fear with comparisons to World War II and 9/11. 
Major political parties and faith groups in South Africa have long recognized the toll climate change is taking on citizens and the environment. As tensions rise and politicians point blame in every direction, faith groups are working across spiritual divides to offer their flocks hope and a way forward.
Counsell’s deliberate water display and opening sermon kicked off the Anglican Diocese of Cape Town’s Water (In)Justice Conference on Saturday (Feb. 3). More than 120 lay and clergy members joined the event, aimed at infusing the upcoming Lenten season with messages and prayers around water’s sacredness, scarcity, sanitation, biodiversity and sustainability.

“We have stopped major crises in the history of our country, and even this one will come to pass,” Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba told the room, later referencing the HIV/AIDS epidemic and apartheid. Makgoba takes issue with the apocalyptic connotations of the name “Day Zero” and suggested parishioners consider “Day One” —  his preferred term for the same scenario — as an opportunity for action.
“From a biblical perspective, the concept of void and nihilism does not sit well, because we take the creation story seriously,” he explained. “Zero has the connotation that this is the end. It doesn’t give us hope. But we are responsible. We can do something. We can avert it.”

The Rev. Rachel Mash, environmental coordinator for the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and Green Anglicans, organized the conference, which featured practical water-saving tools and ideas. Goody bags included dense green plastic blocks participants were advised to drop in their toilet tanks at home to save water. 
“Our job as the church is to reduce water ourselves, inspire others to reduce water, share ideas on how to do that, get the message out into the community, and avert Day Zero,” Mash said. 
The Anglican Diocese is performing environmental audits on individual parishes and fixing leaks. If or when the countdown to Day Zero drops below 30 days, Mash said the denomination plans to install crisis committee representatives at each parish to help coordinate water home delivery for vulnerable people of all faiths and none.

“If we do need to be queueing for water, it would be helpful if faith leaders are there to help marshal and to make sure the elderly, vulnerable, pregnant mums, etc., aren’t standing in the hot sun for hours,” she said. 
Mash invited fellow Anglican and “water prophet” Kevin Winter of the Future Water Institute at the University of Cape Town to address the conference.
“We’ve always imagined climate change as being a slow-moving bus, but we need to recognize that there are speed bumps along the way, and we’re going through one right now,” he said.
Winter’s ultimate message: “Keep calm and save water while we have it.”  
The Rev. Ronald Dias attended the conference from St. Dominic Church Parish in the township of Hanover Park, where he says water quality is already a problem. 
“We have a borehole (water well) at the church, but the police stopped us from using that,” he said. “The water is running very low, and the pressure is very low. What will happen to our soup kitchen on Wednesday mornings? That requires water.” 

New water restrictions came into effect Feb. 1, regulating the use of borehole water wells and limiting Cape Town residents to just 50 liters (13.2 gallons) of water per day. By comparison, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that Americans use 80 to 100 gallons of water each per day.
These numbers, and the growing panic in Cape Town’s wealthy and middle-class neighborhoods, belie a grim reality, Mash is quick to point out. 
“Because Cape Town is such an unjust society, the leafy suburbs have always had enough water for swimming pools and totally ignored the fact that on the other side of the city people don’t have enough water to even throw into their toilet, and they’re sharing one toilet between 20 families,” she said.
On Sunday, the Muslim Judicial Council South Africa joined Habibia Soofie Masjid and Masjidul-Quds to lead more than 1,000 Muslims in an early morning prayer for rain.

Men at the front, women at the back, gathered on green patches of grass at the Rylands sports complex, where signs warned that the nonpotable grey water keeping the field alive is “not suitable for human consumption.”
Presiding sheikhs offered an emotional refrain that highlighted sin and redemption.  
“Each and every person must ask, ‘Where did I go wrong?’ We have done so much wrong. The consequences have brought us to where we are today,” said Sheikh Moegamad Moerat of Zeenatul Islam mosque. “Once we live in halal, Allah will send us beneficial rain.” 
“The root cause is the way we live, the sins we commit,” added Sheikh Riad Fataar, second deputy president of the judicial council. “You have a hand in it, and you can correct it.” 
Several imams encouraged worshippers to pay zakat, obligatory alms, citing a hadith attributed to the Prophet Muhammad that Allah withholds rain for those who withhold their charity.

Pressed about the water crisis’ practical implications for Muslims — supply restrictions on ablution water used for ritual washing before prayer, and questions about whether alcohol-based hand sanitizer, now replacing soap and water in many public restrooms, is halal — Masjidul-Quds President Hafiz Mahmood Khatib said sometimes necessity makes the impermissible permissible.
“The importance of washing ourselves and obtaining a state of purity is important, but more important is finding spiritual purity. Islam enjoins us that when water is scarce you can make your ablution with pure sand,” he said.
For now, many mosques throughout Cape Town have installed aerators on taps or are providing worshippers with spray bottles or single cups of water to perform ablutions. 
Cape Town’s predominantly Orthodox Jewish community has also held several gatherings and half-day fasts to pray for rain. Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein’s office circulated a rain prayer to synagogues and now plans to launch a nationwide daily psalm. 
“We are praying not only for G-d to bring the rain, but also for G-d to give wisdom and insight to all levels of government – national, provincial and city – to guide them in the right direction to find solutions for the water crisis,” Goldstein told RNS by email. 
Beyond individual faith groups’ efforts, several ecumenical and interfaith initiatives have emerged to address the water crisis and “soak the city in prayer.” In May, Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille hosted interfaith leaders at the foot of Table Mountain to pray for rain. 
On Monday, interfaith leaders gathered at St. George’s Cathedral to offer leadership in advancing water justice and averting Day Zero. 
“When the interfaith voice opposed apartheid as a movement, it worked,” Archbishop Makgoba said. “This is a struggle and a crisis. We need to be good stewards. It’s a beautiful opportunity for South Africans to come together. And therein lies our hope.”

(RNS) — Over the past two decades, many Christians have made a dramatic public conversion to environmental causes.
In Protestant churches across the country, they have gone on carbon fasts, planted church vegetable gardens, and struck alliances with Native Americans and others to protect the country from the environmental harm caused by drilling, fracking, mining and building underground gas pipelines.
Following Pope Francis’ lead, Catholic bishops in cities such as Atlanta, Cincinnati, Des Moines, Sacramento, San Diego and others, have ordered churches to undertake energy audits, install solar panels and transition to wind energy.
But despite widespread efforts to advance environmental awareness in churches and seminaries, a new study shows that two decades of advocacy have not made Christians any greener in their outlooks.

The study, a longitudinal look at Gallup’s annual surveys on the environment, reveals that Christians have not become more concerned about the environment, and in some cases have become less so.
Although the study is limited — it was not tailored to religious people but to Americans generally and it did not drill down into particular denominational affiliation — it suggests that the dangers of climate change may not be registering with church members.
“The idea was to see if attitudes have changed over time,” said David Konisky, a political scientist at Indiana University and the author of the study, which is to be published in a forthcoming issue of Environmental Politics.
“In fact, the trends move in the opposite direction. People’s concern over issues such as pollution, in the air, water or toxic waste, their concern about climate change and its urgency, those have all been declining over this time period studied.”

The latest study adds to two previous but less exhaustive studies examining data from the General Social Survey that show similar results.
Konisky’s study examined Gallup environmental surveys during three years during the 1990s and then annually from 2005 to 2015. About 1,000 U.S. respondents each year were asked whether they worried about water, air, soil or toxic waste pollution, whether they see global warming as a threat, and whether they participate in the environmental movement.
The overall pattern that emerged is that concern about the environment has been flat over the past two decades, and in some cases declined. For example, more Christians prioritized economic growth over protecting the environment in 2015 than they did in 1990.

The study does not reflect the impact of “Laudato Si’: On Care for Our Common Home,” Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical on the environment, which was published after the Gallup Poll’s 2015 survey — the last one examined in the study. (The Gallup surveys broke down Christianity into Catholics and Protestants but attitudes toward the environment were similar in both groups.)
Advocates working at the intersection of the environment and religion were sanguine about the study’s findings.
“This involves long-term change and that’s not going to happen in 10 or 20 years,” said Mary Evelyn Tucker, co-director of the Yale Forum on Religion and the Ecology. “All social movements have had pushback. That’s going to happen. But change will go forward.”
Tucker pointed to programs such as Yale Divinity School’s master’s degree in religion and ecology, which trains future ministers to view the environment as a critical component of faith formation.

But others questioned whether the Gallup surveys reliably reflect the concerns of religious people. For many evangelicals, words in the survey like “climate change” and “global warming” invoke pitched political and ideological battles. They may have been more responsive when asked about environmental stewardship — or, in the more common Christian parlance, “creation care.”
That’s the language evangelicals such as Richard Cizik, Rick Warren, and Joel Hunter have used to argue that Christians have a religious duty to be stewards of God’s creation.

Words matter when talking to evangelicals, said Emily Wirzba, a lobbyist with the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker organization.
“We did find that framing it as a moral issue or a faith and religious issue and using ‘creation care’ helps provide political cover and the support members of Congress need to be more vocal on the issue,” she said.
A waning concern on environmental issues may also have something to do with the massive public relations campaign developed by several industries, such as tobacco, gasoline and coal-burning power plants, to sow doubt and confusion about scientific data.
It’s possible that Christians’ lackluster responses to climate change are an indication that these disinformation campaigns were ultimately more successful than the sermons they may have heard in church, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and an evangelical who works to convince Christians about the reality of global warming.

“We have to consider all the important factors that influenced the trajectory of people’s opinion,” Hayhoe said. “We can’t leave out the negative factors, especially when we know they exist and we know they work.”
In the past two decades the environment has become politicized, with Republicans often assailing environmental agencies and regulation and Democrats generally fighting for greener policies. A Pew Research poll this month found that 81 percent of Democrats say protecting the environment should be a top priority, compared with 37 percent of Republicans.

Those divisions affect many Christians too, especially white evangelicals, loyal Republicans who helped elect President Trump.
For these evangelicals, partisanship trumps religious considerations when it comes to the environment.
“Religion is not a very powerful predictor and ideology is,” said Aaron McCright, a sociologist at Michigan State University who co-authored a similar 2014 study finding lower levels of environmental concern among Christians based on the General Social Survey.
All of which means political partisanship may have played a larger role in many respondents’ answers, McCright suggested.
For these more politically minded Christians, environmental awareness may be a much more difficult sell.
The lesson for environmentalists in all this?
“The political Christians are not changing and I do not expect them to change,” said Hayhoe. “They won’t change until the leadership tells them it’s OK to say this.”

The Kentucky Legislature is considering mandating an annual day of student prayer. Image courtesy of Google Maps
(RNS) — The Kentucky Legislature is considering mandating an annual day of student prayer.
House Bill 40 would make the last Wednesday in September “A Day of Prayer for Kentucky’s Students” and would require the state’s governor to proclaim it as such every year.
The bill passed the Kentucky House last week by a broad margin and is now in the state Senate.
Regina Huff, a Republican representative from Williamsburg, Ky., who is one of five Republican sponsors of the bill, told a local news outlet that the proposed law is nondiscriminatory because it does not mention a specific religion but allows students to pray or meditate “in accordance with their own faith and consciences.”
Students would participate in the Day of Prayer before the regular school day, she said.
“Their event at school will be student-initiated and -conducted, and always before the start of the school day,” Huff said.
Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican elected in 2014, has declared the last Wednesday in September a day of prayer for Kentucky students for the last two years.
The Supreme Court ruled against school-sponsored prayer in public schools in Engel v. Vitale in 1962.
But courts have generally rejected challenges to “See You at the Pole” events, in which students who want to pray gather at their school’s flagpole outside of class time. And the Supreme Court has generally upheld student-led prayer as long as it is not compulsory or organized by school officials.

 Religion News Service (https://religionnews.com/2018/03/19/dc-councilman-apologizes-for-claiming-the-weather-is-controlled-by-jews/)
WASHINGTON (RNS) — A city councilman in the nation’s capital has apologized for propagating a conspiracy theory that Jewish financiers control the weather.
On Sunday (March 18), D.C. Council member Trayon White Sr., a Democrat, posted a video to Facebook shortly after snow flurries began to fall in the region. The clip, which was published at 7:21 a.m., featured a narration by White as the camera was pointed out a car windshield to showcase wintry conditions.
“Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,” White said. “And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.”
Mayer Amschel Rothschild was a Jewish banker in 18th-century Frankfurt, Germany, who, with his wealthy family, has long been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. “In the literature of bigots,” the Rothschilds have been targeted in attacks on Jews as manipulators of global events, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Blowback to White’s remarks — which included outcry from at least one local rabbi — was swift. Although White initially told The Washington Post he was unsure why the video was being framed as anti-Semitic, he issued an apology hours later.
“I work hard everyday to combat racism and prejudices of all kinds. I want to apologize to the Jewish Community and anyone I have offended,” White told the Post on Sunday.
“The Jewish community have been allies with me in my journey to help people. I did not intend to be anti-Semitic, and I see I should not have said that after learning from my colleagues.”
I really do apologize. I work very closely with the Jewish community and never want to offend anyone, especially with Anti-Semitic remarks. pic.twitter.com/TvUgf55UeF

 Religion News Service (https://religionnews.com/2018/03/19/modest-streetwear-for-muslim-women/)

(RNS) — If you’re part of the modest fashion circle on Instagram, then you know that indie apparel brands aimed at Muslim women are now a dime a dozen. There’s Vela Scarves, Austere Attire, Urban Modesty, Haute Hijab, Ahfif, Culture Hijab, Infinite Abaya — the list goes on and on.
Since Seek Refuge Co.’s crowdfunding initiative launched in February, though, the clothing line has stood apart from the crowd. Vogue dubbed it the “first modest streetwear brand” because of its uniquely edgy style: tees with slick graphic prints, a black hoodie with bell sleeves. But Seek Refuge’s founder, Shazia Ijaz, told Religion News Service she would instead define her brand as the world’s first streetwear brand for Muslim women.

Why? The difference, she says, is that she’s not trying to compete with modest fashion brands. “We’re saying this is a brand for Muslim women regardless of the level of modesty they follow,” she says.
Because for her, designing clothes for Muslim women is less about a modest fit and more about carrying out an Islamic ethic. Of course, it’s also about style.
“The modest fashion industry didn’t have anything that was speaking to the fashion-forward and edgy Muslim girl,” Ijaz says. “They’re all speaking to a person that I would see as my mom or my aunt.”

Ijaz, a 25-year-old Pakistani-American entrepreneur, moved to Silicon Valley after earning her degree in business. There, she worked in marketing for the app Poshmark, a social marketplace for fashion, until a horse-riding accident made it difficult to hold a typical 9-to-5 job.
That’s when she realized she would have to start her own company to put her health first – and to fulfill her own sky-high ambitions. And so, armed with new knowledge of social marketing and the fashion industry, she started designing products for her new line.
Now, less than a year later, an online crowdfunding campaign has raised more than 100 percent of the $20,000 she needs to move to production.
Part of the reason her project line has been so successful is because she’s catering to a different fashion sense than other indie brands aimed at Muslims. You won’t find any lace, frills or elegant pleats on her designs, and that’s done on purpose.
Ijaz says the U.S. modest fashion industry’s style has developed through self-reinforcement. Until major Muslim bloggers and hijab-wearing style influencers began emerging online, modest fashion wasn’t something many people were paying attention to.

“What Muslim women were wearing as ‘modest fashion’ at that point was just clothes designed with a different, more mainstream audience in mind, but happen to meet their modesty requirements,” Ijaz explains. “So the clothing that worked for them ended up being very elegant, very feminine in design.”
That feminine look – think elegant maxi dresses, flowy ankle-length skirts and long cardigans – became the style of the woman who wanted to dress modestly, because it was what was available to her in department stores like Macy’s and Nordstrom.
When the modest fashion industry began taking off, new specialized clothing lines such as Aab and Inayah only reinforced that default style. “They didn’t focus on the fact that modest fashion doesn’t need to have a feminine and frilly aesthetic, and that probably the millennial Muslim girl doesn’t want to dress that way.”
Even as major clothing companies are slowly realizing the buying power Muslims have, the clothing styles being offered remain largely the same. Uniqlo’s partnership with British Muslim designer Hana Tajima mostly sells flowy, long tunics and dresses; Ramadan collections from Zara, Tommy Hilfiger, DKNY and other big names mostly feature maxi skirts and dresses. Even Macy’s high-profile new collaboration with Muslim designer Lisa Vogl of Verona Collection sells satin hijabs, long cardigans and elegant, ruffled blouses.
Ijaz aims to fill that gap in the market with Seek Refuge’s oversized denim jacket (“meticulously designed to be both modest and edgy”), a hoodie that references the evil eye and T-shirts designed to represent the spiritual journey to finding God.

And all her pieces, which she designed herself, can work for Muslim women who follow any level of modesty — not just ones who wear hijab or the robelike abaya. Maybe they cover their legs but wear short-sleeved shirts, or maybe they wear slouchy tops that cover their hips.
Catering to that full spectrum is important to Ijaz, who says that the hijab has been seen as the defining aspect of being a Muslim woman in popular culture and in the fashion space. “Muslim woman who don’t wear hijab and still want to express their religion and their culture didn’t really have an outlet to do that,” she says.
But everything about the Seek Refuge clothing line is designed to promote an Islamic ethic that goes beyond hijab.
The brand name draws on the words of a common Islamic prayer for God’s protection (“I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan”) as well as a poem by a Syrian refugee (“We cried peace but in bloodshed / That oh, we’d better seek refuge”).

“We’re not just catering to aesthetic,” Ijaz told Religion News Service, fresh from her third volunteer trip to Guatemala with the faith-based humanitarian relief organization Humanity First. “We’re really aligning our values with our consumers’ Islamic values from end to end.”
That means no fast fashion and no harmful labor practices. She’s working with an ethical manufacturing facility in Istanbul that employs resettled refugees. At least 10 percent of her company’s proceeds will be donated to two of Humanity First’s refugee schools in Jordan.
That mission of refugee aid carries over to Ijaz’s designs as well. The back of Seek Refuge’s flagship denim jacket is emblazoned with that same poem by a Syrian refugee, which is written in Arabic by a Muslim calligrapher.

As a member of a minority Muslim group, Ijaz grew up exposed to a refugee crisis her entire life, seeing members of her community facing religious persecution and being driven from their homeland. And while the White House has slashed the number of refugees the U.S. will accept, the global refugee crisis has reached historic proportions: Every single minute, about 20 people are being forcibly displaced from their home, she says, citing U.N. data.
“A majority of these refugees are Muslim, and young Muslims care about helping them,” Ijaz says. “So we built that into both our supply chain and our designs.”

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Stung by accusations of spreading “fake news,” the Vatican on Saturday (March 17) released the complete letter by Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI about Pope Francis after coming under blistering criticism for selectively citing it in a press release and digitally manipulating a photograph of it.

The previously hidden part of the letter provides the full explanation why Benedict refused to write a commentary on a new Vatican-published compilation of books about Francis’ theological and philosophical background that was released to mark his fifth anniversary as pope.
In addition to saying he didn’t have time, Benedict noted that one of the authors involved in the project had launched “virulent,” ”anti-papist” attacks against his teaching and that of St. John Paul II. He said he was “surprised” the Vatican had chosen the theologian to be included in the 11-volume “The Theology of Pope Francis.”
“I’m certain you can understand why I’m declining,” Benedict wrote.

The Vatican’s Secretariat for Communications said Saturday it was releasing the full text of the letter due to the controversy over the “presumed manipulation” of information when the volume was launched Monday with great fanfare on the eve of Francis’ anniversary.
It said its decision to withhold part of the letter at the time was based on its desire for reserve, “not because of any desire to censor.”
The “Lettergate” scandal has embarrassed the Vatican’s communications operations and fueled the growing chasm between supporters of Francis’ pastoral-focused papacy and conservatives who long for the doctrine-minded tenure of Benedict.
A Twitter hashtag #releasetheletter went viral among Catholic conservatives as the scandal widened.
The Secretariat for Communication, in particular, was accused of spreading “fake news” for having omitted key parts of Benedict’s letter and — as The Associated Press reported — digitally blurring a photograph of the document where Benedict started to explain why he wouldn’t comment on the book.
Photojournalism industry standards forbid such manipulation of a photo, especially if it alters the content and meaning of the image, as it did.
Many commentators noted the irony of accusations that the Vatican’s communications office was spreading “fake news,” since Francis dedicated his annual message for the church’s social communications day to fighting “fake news” and the distortion of information. Francis has frequently criticized journalists for only giving half of the story.
The scandal began when the prefect of the communications office, Monsignor Dario Vigano, read part of Benedict’s letter aloud at the book presentation Monday. Vigano explained that he had sent Benedict the 11-volume set months ago in hopes of eliciting a theological commentary from the retired pope.
In the parts of Benedict’s letter that Vigano chose to read, Benedict confirmed that Francis has a solid theological and philosophical training and he praised the book initiative for showing the “interior continuity” between the two papacies. He wrote it was “foolish prejudice” to paint Francis as only a practical man devoid of theology and Benedict as a mere academic who knew nothing of the lives of ordinary faithful.
Vigano held up the letter as evidence of the theological continuity between the two papacies, an effort to blunt conservative critics of Francis’ mercy-over-morals priorities and emphasis on “discernment” over hard-and-fast doctrine.
But Benedict’s full caveat about his refusal to comment on the volume was never made public in Vigano’s presentation, press release or accompanying photo. That omission left the impression that the 91-year-old retired pope had read the volume and fully endorsed it, when in fact he hadn’t.
As a result, Vigano’s effort to show papal continuity effectively backfired. Benedict’s harsh criticism of German theologian Peter Huenermann, who penned one of the 11 books, laid bare the differences in theological approaches of the two popes.
The first hint there was more to the initial story came when a longtime Vatican reporter, Sandro Magister, published a transcript of what Vigano had read aloud at the presentation, which was more than what was included in the Vatican’s press release. Magister’s transcript of the letter contained Benedict’s initial explanation that he couldn’t read the 11 volumes due to his age and other commitments, and therefore couldn’t comment on it.
Magister on Saturday reported that the omitted paragraph concerned Benedict’s objection to Huenermann, who has joined leading European progressive theologians since the 1980s in penning open letters attacking the policies of John Paul and Benedict.
Left unsaid is who was responsible for selecting Huenermann to write one of the 11 books in Francis’ anniversary anthology, given the author’s past attacks on the retired pope, who lives just across the Vatican gardens from Francis.

BALI, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia’s normally bustling Bali has shut down social media, turned away flights and shuttered all shops for a Day of Silence that marks the new year on the predominantly Hindu island.
“Nyepi” began at 6 a.m. on Saturday (March 17), emptying streets and beaches for 24 hours except for special patrols to ensure silence is observed. This year for the first time, phone companies have agreed to turn off the mobile internet on the island that’s home to more than 4 million people.
Aside from no Facebook, Instagram or instant messaging apps, television and radio broadcasts cease and Balinese stay indoors, covering the windows and not even turning on a light, for the day of reflection that is the most sacred in Balinese Hinduism.
“Nyepi is the time for us to wash our hearts and minds of bad thoughts and deeds, plead with God to purify ourselves, human beings and the universe,” said Kadek Chantini, a Bali tour guide.
Not everyone was happy with the decision to disrupt internet access, saying it was going too far and an inconvenience for tourists and non-Hindu residents of Bali, but others welcomed it.
“It will certainly provide a quieter atmosphere so we can focus and concentrate on perfecting our meditation and prayers,” said Komang Suda, a resident of Denpasar, the Bali provincial capital.
“The decision also really helps us in disciplining our teenagers who sometimes sneak off to play with their gadgets during Nyepi,” he said.
The night before Nyepi is marked by noisy “ogoh-ogoh” processions of giant scary figures representing evil spirits.

(RNS) — One of the two Bibles Donald Trump used to take the oath of office is joining others used by American presidents at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.
The Revised Standard Version edition Bible given to the future 45th president of the United States by his mother when he was a child is the same Bible he used when he attended First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, N.Y.

In January 2017, President-elect Trump showed the hard-bound Bible to David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network and described an inscription Trump said was made by his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, who died in 2000.
“It’s amazing and all written out sort of like so that I always know that it is mine,” Trump said, showing a white flyleaf inscribed with handwritten cursive. “But it is special and I open that and I look at it a lot.”

The Bible also has the Trump name etched on the front cover. Upon his graduation from Sunday school — in 1955 at age 9 — it was signed by his pastor and Sunday school teachers.
At his inauguration, the president also took the oath of office on the Lincoln Bible, which was also used by President Obama at his 2009 inauguration.

The Revised Standard Version was a new version of the Bible when Trump was a child. Its New Testament was published in 1946, the year of Trump’s birth, and it was published in full in 1952. It was the standard Bible used in most mainline Protestant churches through the 1970s and into the 1980s.
The Trump Bible joins other presidential Bibles on display on the second floor of the Museum of the Bible, a private institution that opened on the Washington Mall in November. The collection includes Bibles from Presidents George W. Bush, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

“We are honored to add this piece of our nation’s history to our growing exhibit of presidential Bibles,” Museum of the Bible President Cary Summers said in a statement.

Reggie Wilson’s Platform for Danspace Project considers the importance of houses of worship in the largely secular world of contemporary dance.
By Siobhan Burke
When you step into St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery, you might not know that you’re standing on what was once the farm of the Dutch director-general Peter Stuyvesant. Or that the balcony in the church sanctuary was once known as a slave gallery. Or that the modern dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis performed there in 1933, long before it became home to Danspace Project in 1974. 
You might not know that before 1959, the church had separate Sunday services for black and white congregants, or that in 1970 the Black Panthers held meetings in the rectory basement. And if you’re there for a performance presented by Danspace, you might not realize that the church still functions as a church.
“Some folks assume that the church doesn’t have a congregation or that it’s deconsecrated,” the choreographer and performer Reggie Wilson said on a recent afternoon. “That’s really not true. It’s a very active and politically active church.”
Mr. Wilson is the curator of “Dancing Platform, Praying Grounds: Blackness, Churches and Downtown Dance,” a series of performances, conversations and walking tours that will unfold in and around St. Mark’s over the next three weeks. Organized with Danspace’s executive director, Judy Hussie-Taylor, the series examines, among other themes, the connections between houses of worship and experimental dance in New York, with a focus on the history of Danspace, St. Mark’s and their surrounding blocks.
“It’s one of these things that’s right in front of us, but it doesn’t seem like anyone is talking about,” Mr. Wilson said about the importance of religious spaces in the largely secular world of contemporary dance. 
“Considering how prevalent it is in New York, you’d think there would have been a lot more interrogation: the positive and negative relationships, the challenges, why it consistently happens,” he said. The program for “Dancing Platform, Praying Grounds,” he added, “is about cracking that open.”
St. Mark’s, as dancegoers know, is not the only church in which downtown dance has thrived. The other prime example: Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, where the trailblazing Judson Dance Theater sprang up in 1962, giving rise to postmodern dance, and where Movement Research has hosted free weekly showings for over 25 years. A new partnership in a similar vein has been developing at Cadman Congregational Church in Clinton Hill, home to Brooklyn Studios for Dance since 2015.
Mr. Wilson said he was intrigued not just by churches but also by other spiritual sites hospitable to not-necessarily-spiritual arts, such as the Jewish-affiliated 92nd Street Y and the former Sufi mosque in SoHo that once housed Dia Center for the Arts. For Ms. Hussie-Taylor, the complex subject always leads back to St. Mark’s: “Where are we actually standing?” she said. “What is this place? You could go in a million directions, but that’s a question we’ve returned to again and again.”
Mr. Wilson, 50, who grew up in Milwaukee and founded the company Fist & Heel Performance Group in 1989, has long explored spiritual traditions in his own work, particularly within African and African-American cultures. He said his dances are guided by two lines of inquiry: “What is the relationship between postmodern dance and African diasporic culture? And what is the relationship between Protestant Christianity and African diasporic religions? Even if the piece seems like it has nothing to do with either of those, they creep back in there.”
“Dancing Platform, Praying Grounds” — which runs through March 24, culminating in a new work by Mr. Wilson — is the latest in the Platform series initiated by Ms. Hussie-Taylor in 2010. Each platform, organized by a guest artist-curator, revolves around a particular theme or set of questions.
Ms. Hussie-Taylor approached Mr. Wilson after seeing his 2013 work “Moses(es)” twice, first at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, then at St. Cornelius Chapel on Governors Island. In the afternoon light of the chapel, it struck her differently than it had in the theater. “It makes sense,” she said, “that Reggie’s work would read and resonate in a church space.” 
Mr. Wilson said that he at first resisted taking on a curatorial role, preferring to stay focused on the time-consuming process of creating his own work. But, through discussions with Ms. Hussie-Taylor, the idea grew more appealing.
While Mr. Wilson led the platform planning, it was Ms. Hussie-Taylor who invited him to show a new piece of his own, which will have its premiere March 22. The site-specific “…they stood shaking while others began to shout,” for eight dancers and three singers (including him), stems from his research into Black Shakers, chiefly the religious activist Mother Rebecca Cox Jackson.
“When I first heard about her, I was like, ‘a black Shaker!’ — that’s the biggest contradiction I’ve ever heard,” he said. “I just always imagined Shakers as white people, like Puritans.” 
In an early rehearsal four dancers shuffled buoyantly through crisscrossing patterns based on a reconstructed Shaker dance, circling their arms in the air. The choreography will likely evolve. “I’ve always made my own folk dances,” Mr. Wilson said. “People are like, ‘Oh my God, where did you get that dance?’ ”
In excavating the history of St. Mark’s and its neighborhood, Mr. Wilson and the curatorial team — which also includes Lydia Bell and Kristin Juarez — worked with Prithi Kanakamedala, a historian and professor at the City University of New York, who assembled a dossier of readings to share with the platform artists. Ms. Kanakamedala, whose research interests include New York's 19th-century free black communities, is one of several scholars and artists who will lead walking tours of the East Village and Harlem as part of the platform.
“New York City’s churches have always been open to far more radical activity than I think people recognize,” she said. “We have this very Victorian idea of what a church is. But there’s something to be said about churches as radical spaces, in which dance just naturally becomes part of that radicalism.”
For three nights beginning March 8, five choreographers — Beth Gill, Jonathan Gonzalez, Miguel Gutierrez, Angie Pittman and Edisa Weeks — will respond to the dossier materials in a program titled “The Dossier Charrette: a series of working dance essays.” (A term from architecture, a charrette is an intense period of collaborative problem-solving.) The 10-minute works will be followed by discussion among the artists, audience members and Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilson laughed at the heft of the dossier — which covers “the ice age to the present,” he said — and described it as “a set of points of departure for the artists to get more obsessed with.” Ms. Pittman, for instance, said she was most drawn to writings about precolonial Manhattan and its indigenous people, the Lenape. 
The platform themes, she added, connected to her own history; some of her earliest dance experiences were as a liturgical dancer in a predominantly black church. In praise dance, she said, “you’re there to illustrate the presence of a higher power, or deflect attention from you to something that’s bigger than you. That’s huge for me as I engage with dance right now.”
The platform also includes a daylong symposium on March 10; an evening shared by Keely Garfield, Same As Sister (Hilary Brown and Briana Brown-Tipley) and Ni’Ja Whitson (March 15-17); and the publication of a companion catalog. 
“I’m terrified, and I’m terribly excited,” said Mr. Wilson, adding that as both a curator and choreographer, he’s not seeking perfection. 
“The platform for me isn’t trying to answer anything or display anything,” he said. “Hopefully it’s a way of opening more doors for conversation.”

First,  Jared Kushner has some significant problems, even if we don’t yet know exactly what they are. He has lost his top-secret security clearance, and several foreign governments — including China’s — believe his business interests have made him vulnerable to manipulation.
In any other White House, Kushner would either be out of a job or temporarily step away from matters of national security, writes Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post. In this White House, President Trump may decide to leave Kushner in his senior role and even continue showing him top-secret information, explains Lawfare’s Susan Hennessey.
Once again, Trump is putting the interests of himself and his family over those of the country.
The benefits of faith. In his Sunday column this week, Ross Douthat issued something of a challenge to secular liberals. They think of themselves as empiricists, Ross wrote, but they’re actually close-minded about several powerful forces for good, starting with religion.
“When people and societies are genuinely curious,” he continued, “they are very reasonably curious about everything, including things happening in their bodies and their consciousness and more speculative realms.”
The column reminded me of a pattern that, as a secular liberal myself, I’ve long found inconvenient: Religion is correlated with a lot of healthy behaviors and positive outcomes. All else equal, religious people have higher educational attainment, earn more money, use drugs and alcohol less and commit fewer crimes, according to a long line of social-science studies (that have frequently been done by secular liberals).
The question about these findings is the old correlation-causation question: Does religious faith lead to these healthy behaviors? Or is something else, independent of faith, causing them?
A clever new study tries to offer some answers. It’s not anywhere near the last word on the matter, obviously, but it is intriguing.
The three economists who conducted the study sound like something out of a bad bar joke, as one of them, Dean Karlan, remarked to me: “an atheist, an evangelical Christian and an agnostic Jew.” To do the research, they partnered with an evangelical anti-poverty group, International Care Ministries, in the Philippines.
The group taught 15 weeks of classes to more than 6,000 very poor Filipinos. Some of the students received a version that combined religious teachings with advice on health and employment. Others received only the nonreligious parts. By comparing the different batches of students, the economists hoped to isolate the effect of religion.
The results: Six months later, those who received the religious education indeed reported feeling more guided by religion. They were also earning more money, largely by shifting from agricultural work to higher-paying jobs, such as fishing or self-employment. And even small pay increases can be a big deal for people living in extreme poverty.
The results did come with some contradictions. Several other measures of well-being, like food consumption, didn’t change. A few measures, like the frequency of arguments with relatives, looked worse for the religious group. But crosscurrents like these are normal in academic work. Overall, the findings are “cautiously positive” for the power of religion, said Karlan, a professor at Northwestern (and the self-identified agnostic Jew).
No study is definitive. But I do find the overall evidence of religion’s ancillary benefits to be strong. That evidence hasn’t made me personally religious. I’m still quite comfortable with my secularism. But the evidence has made me more humble and open-minded about how the world can go about solving some of its problems.
You can read more about the study at the Innovations for Poverty Action website. In addition to Karlan, the researchers are James Choi of Yale and Gharad Bryan of the London School of Economics. The researchers are continuing to follow the people in the study.
Speaking of correlation and causation, Paul Krugman has a short bonus column (known in the old days as a blog post) on “the very bad, no good job much of the media initially did” covering the effects of the Trump tax cut.

Millions of Jewish families all over the globe are prepping for Passover — an eight-day religious festival that, once a year, turns matzo into one of the most popular commodities at certain grocery stores.
This year, Passover starts the evening of Friday, March 30 and ends at sundown on Saturday, April 7. Those observing Passover will celebrate by eating matzo and holding Seder meals, while sticking to common kosher practices — which means they’ll be avoiding certain foods, specifically leavened breads. But what does keeping kosher even mean — and do foods like rice, corn and oatmeal count as unleavened bread?
Keeping kosher requires that observers — among following other religious practices — refrain from eating pork or shellfish and to only eat meat that has been slaughtered according to specific rules, which includes a rabbi supervising to make sure the meat is kosher. Kosher food rules also extend to the way foods are prepared and served — for example, those who keep kosher can’t eat dairy and meat at the same time.
But during Passover, there’s an additional rule — for those who keep kosher and those just observing the annual Jewish holiday. For eight days, observers are basically on a gluten-free diet as well and have to avoid all unleavened breads. It can be tough to tell which foods are and aren’t kosher for Passover, especially common items like rice, corn, beans and oatmeal. And it turns out the answers vary, and typically depend on a person’s Jewish ancestry.
Ashkenazi Jews, who are of European descent, have historically avoided rice, beans, corn and other foods like lentils and edamame at Passover. The tradition goes back to the 13th century, when custom dictated a prohibition against wheat, barley, oats, rice, rye and spelt, Rabbi Amy Levin said on NPR in 2016. Because rice and legumes were sometimes mixed with wheat — which is avoided during Passover unless it’s in its unleavened form, matzo — those items were avoided, too, according to the Times of Israel.
The kosher food rules have been controversial for about as long as Passover has existed, Levin said, “simply because the custom prohibits foods that are, according to Torah law, which is like the Jewish Constitution, permitted to be eaten.” According to the rabbi, the rule was “geographically limited.”
But the kosher food rules have since changed. In 2015, the Rabbinical Assembly, a global group of Conservative Jewish rabbis, ruled that rice, corn, beans, popcorn and other similar items that were previously prohibited would be allowed at Passover Seders, NPR reported.
These new kosher foods have always been a part of the diet of Sephardic Jews, whose ancestry goes back to the Middle East, North Africa and other areas around the Mediterranean Sea. Legumes and grains are considered kosher, and rice, bean and lentil dishes have long been served at Passover.
So, if you’re hosting a Seder dinner this year, feel free to add a rice and beans dish to the table.", religion

The 10-car motorcade carrying the body of America’s most famous evangelist wound its way 130 miles through North Carolina. Down mountain roads and interstates, the cortege passed thousands of men and women who raised Bibles and American flags in tribute. Pallbearers carried the pine plywood casket into his family library in Charlotte, where former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton arrived to pay their respects. Then Billy Graham flew one last time to Washington, to lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol’s Rotunda, a recognition usually reserved for Presidents.
Graham’s final journey befitted his legend. A humble, golden-haired farm boy once felt a call from heaven, and left home to tell the world. He became one of the most charismatic figures of the 20th century, a confidant to Democratic and Republican Presidents alike. More than 215 million people over six decades flocked to hear him preach forgiveness in person. Rulers sought his counsel. He made evangelicalism relevant in the halls of power and around the world.
But in the wake of Graham’s death at age 99 on Feb. 21 comes discord. His prodigal firstborn son has risen as heir to his religious empire. And yet it is difficult to imagine most anything that Franklin Graham says coming from the mouth of his father. The elder Graham rose to the heights of religious power in America by uniting evangelicals after a fundamentalist crisis in the early 20th century. His son has risen to prominence by embracing the divisions of our time. He defends President Donald Trump amid allegations of affairs and hush-money payments. He rails against the Supreme Court’s ruling to legalize same-sex-marriage. He says Muslims have “hijacked Abraham,” the patriarch shared by Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
It is not just outsiders who know that the house of Graham has entered a new era of division. The difference between father and son is impossible to ignore, even for those who love Franklin most. “Daddy’s style was so gentle, maybe not in the beginning, but loving and warm,” Franklin’s sister Anne Graham Lotz told TIME in 2016. “You think of Daddy speaking at the National Cathedral after 9/11,” she said. “That is Daddy, and Franklin is just not that.” Lotz, whom Billy once called the “best preacher in the family,” has at times tried to temper Franklin’s firebrand approach but remains largely offstage as head of her own small ministry in Raleigh, N.C.
The fractured Graham legacy is about more than just the first family of American Christianity. The Grahams represent the state of evangelicalism in the U.S., pulled apart by the extremism of the day. Without their unifying senior statesman, American evangelicals today are fighting over politics, the President, Islam, women’s leadership, same-sex marriage and what the very basics of Christian witness should be. “There won’t be another Billy Graham,” says Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif. “The world has changed.”
Franklin, called by his father’s middle name, has long been the heir apparent to the family’s religious empire. As a young man, he was a college dropout with a taste for whiskey. When he was finally ordained at age 29, his father called the occasion “a culmination of my life’s work.” In recent years, Franklin, now 65, has run the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) as well as his own international Christian humanitarian organization, Samaritan’s Purse, while his father lived quietly with caretakers at his mountain home in Montreat, N.C.
Unlike his father, Franklin gravitates to the edge. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he launched a vote-your-values bus tour to all 50 states to push evangelicals to the polls. Technically, he wasn’t affiliated with the GOP, but he made his political allegiances known. In an interview with TIME on the tour, Franklin voluntarily brought up Trump more than any other Republican candidate. He called for a ban on Muslim immigration six months before Trump did and criticized people who “demonized” the police in protests over racial bias.
Franklin’s voter-mobilization efforts worked: more than 80% of white evangelicals voted for Trump. Franklin believes that God put Trump in office. He darkly declares that the U.S. has deteriorated since his father’s day, and he sees that fact as license to say what he wants. “People don’t want to be told they are sinning,” he told TIME in 2016. “I just don’t care.”
Not all of Billy’s followers respond to such rhetoric. Lotz said during the campaign that she did not think her father would have done her brother’s get-out-the-vote tour, and she raised her concerns to both Franklin and the BGEA board, on which she also serves. But like her father, Lotz is diplomatic, and she believes God is using her brother. “As my mother would say, He goes where angels fear to tread,” she said. “One of the issues we have today is that so many of the political issues are moral issues, and you have to take a stand.”
Lotz, 69, has never been her family’s public protagonist. She leads her own Christian organization, AnGeL Ministries, headquartered in an unassuming building near a Raleigh strip mall. Like Franklin, Lotz worries about abortion and same-sex marriage. But she rarely mentions culture-war issues. Even talking about evangelicals as a voting bloc concerns her. When pressed, she says she would have voted for Carly Fiorina had she survived the primaries. “Politics is not our message,” she said in 2016. “If evangelicals are all aligned with ‘this,’ then how can we reach the people over there, on the other side of the aisle, with our message?”
Lotz prefers to follow the model of a biblical prophet who wept and prayed over society’s sins instead of losing his temper and pointing fingers. But that leaves her, and those like her, wandering in the wilderness of today’s American evangelical landscape, far removed from the movement’s fiery leaders, including her brother. Her organization takes in a mere $1 million a year, a fraction of the BGEA’s annual revenue of about $100 million. Even if she had a wider cultural following, most evangelical churches do not let women preach.
The difference between father, son and daughter says as much about the changing nature of the U.S. as it does about the Graham family. Both Billy and Franklin are creatures of their generations. Billy rose to greatness by giving evangelicals a vision beyond the fundamentalism that had taken hold during the evolution and creation debates and the Scopes trial of 1925. He navigated a path through the civil rights era, holding racially integrated crusades across the South but stopping short of marching with Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. He was no saint–tapes secretly recorded by Richard Nixon revealed Billy making anti-Semitic remarks with the famously bigoted Republican President. But Graham’s light touch gave his followers a way to embrace traditional American revivalism outside of the hot political issues of the day.
The American religious landscape was changing in Billy’s final decade. More than a third of millennials identify as religiously unaffiliated, more than any previous generation, according to the Pew Research Center. Only 41% of millennials say religion is very important to them, compared with 72% of the Greatest Generation. The youngest evangelicals are increasingly diverse and more open to same-sex marriage than their elders. At the same time, and perhaps in response, their elders have dug in. Billy’s alma mater, the evangelical Wheaton College in Illinois, made national headlines in recent years not for spiritual revival but for opposition to the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate and for the racial tensions driven by the contentious departure of its only black tenured female professor in 2016.
Nothing has revealed evangelicalism’s divisions more than Trump’s rise. If the white evangelical base that for decades looked to Billy for inspiration began to fracture as he aged, it flat out splintered in the 2016 presidential primaries. Some of the faithful opted for more traditional representatives of the conservative social agenda, like Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. But a large contingent of white, blue collar, non-college-educated evangelicals united around Trump. And once atop the GOP ticket, Trump attracted new fundamentalist forces into an alliance with more traditional evangelicals. Prosperity gospel and Pentecostal pastors found political power attaching themselves to a thrice-married, foulmouthed businessman.
In this environment, Franklin’s way found success. His hard-edged politics earned him the President’s ear. His Facebook following has roughly doubled since his 2016 tour, from 3.4 million to 6.5 million. His daily, often controversial posts earn tens of thousands of likes and shares, evangelizing a new, different audience from that of his father. At the same time, Billy’s passing leaves many less strident evangelicals without a leader. Lotz has chosen prayer amid the rancor. Warren hopes to find a way for evangelicalism to rebuild “credibility and trust.”
And so Billy Graham’s journey, ironically, ends amid the divisions he once healed. His burial makes that clear. Even a decade ago, when people imagined Billy’s funeral, it was a given that all living former Presidents would attend. Now, when Franklin eulogizes his father on March 2, the only Commander in Chief expected in the audience is Trump.

After Billy Graham, Rick Warren may be the most famous, living evangelical in the world.
The day Graham died at age 99, Warren, the pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, and the author of the bestselling The Purpose Driven Life, shared his memories of America’s most famous evangelist with TIME.
“Billy was my hero and my model,” Warren says. “It would be hard to overestimate Billy Graham’s influence on my life and ministry.”
Warren admired Graham from an early age. He read his first Graham book Peace With God when he was in the 6th grade. At 17, he heard Graham speak for the first time at the Oakland California crusade. While still in high school, Warren began to speak to youth groups and churches. “Growing up in a Baptist home, Billy Graham was our pope,” Warren says.
Warren first met Graham personally when he was 20. By then, Warren had preached at more than 120 youth crusades on the west coast. Graham noticed, and took an interest in the young preacher. “That began a mentoring relationship with him, very close, for the next 40 years,” Warren recalls.
Like most in his generation of evangelicals, Warren looked to Graham to learn how to preach. “As I grew older, it really was his character more than even his preaching that became a model for me, his integrity, his humility, his generosity,” Warren says. “I wanted these things in my life.”
Graham invited a college-age Warren to teach thousands of Christian leaders at one of his evangelism conferences in Amsterdam after Warren wrote his first book on how to study the Bible. “I thought, I didn’t feel good about my writing, but if Billy Graham thinks it’s okay, it must be okay,” Warren remembers. “Purpose Driven Life may have never been written if I hadn’t had that encouragement.”
Once Warren flew to Graham’s home in North Carolina after Graham asked him for an update on his PEACE Plan, a global initiative for churches to change things like poverty and disease in their local communities. “He said, ‘Rick this is the greatest vision I’ve ever heard, I just wish I was around long enough to see it happen’,” Warren remembers. “I’m sure I wasn’t the only one who received that kind of encouragement.”
Today, Warren says that some of his most valuable possessions are the personal cards and notes Graham would send him over the years. “One he wrote to me, I think it was the first time I was interviewed on the Larry King show on CNN,” Warren says. “It is framed in my office, between a note from Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa.”
When Warren prayed at President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009, Graham sent him the hat he had worn to pray at inaugurations past, with a handwritten note. “He said, Rick, I wore this hat to all the inaugurations I’ve prayed at. You are the man now, I love you like a son in the Lord, God bless you, I’m all for you, Billy,” Warren recalls. He wore Graham’s hat on the inaugural dais.
On American evangelicalism’s civil war over President Donald Trump, with Graham’s son Franklin standing by the commander-in-chief, Warren has stayed largely quiet. “I’m not on the record on anything about the President but I have very strong opinions about that guy,” he says.
Warren attributes much of his approach to his mentor. “By not getting involved in partisan politics, he ministered to politicians clearly,” Warren says. “He knew what it meant to be a bridge builder and a unifier, rather than a divider.”
For now, Warren is focused on building evangelical momentum behind the scenes to combat racism, to support immigrants, and to speak out on sexual abuse and harassment.
“He taught me to avoid the flatterers, ignore the critics, ignore the cheers and the jeers on the sideline, just keep focused on your purpose,” Warren says. “That humility allowed him to learn from anybody. I’ve adopted that.”
If there is a Bible passage that comes to mind about Graham, Warren says it is in the New Testament book of Acts: “David served God’s purpose in his generation, and then he died,” it reads.
Every Christian must serve God in his or her own time, Warren says, learning to serve God’s eternal causes in a changing world.
“That is what Billy did,” says Warren. “And then, he died. To me, that would be a great thing to have on your tombstone.”

We are told that one should avoid discussing two things at the dinner table: religion and politics. Clearly they have never eaten at our dinner tables. Religion and politics can be polarizing, precisely because they deal with important matters that are deeply personal and close to our passions. But these discussions do not have to be polarizing or combative. Intolerance of another person’s faith is a personal choice, not a legal requirement.
We are also told that we “should not mix religion and politics.” Again, this saying has a powerful truth: that when religion is used for political purposes, it empties religion of its eternal meaning and becomes just one more cynical method of acquiring power.
But there is also a disclaimer hidden in that phrase: that sometimes when people say “Don’t mix religion and politics,” they actually mean “Don’t bring your faith into the public square where I can see it.” In other words, hide your faith outside of your place of worship because we have a “separation of church and state.” Separation of church and state is too important a concept to be misused — especially not as a tool for silencing opposing views. As a matter of fact, on National Religious Freedom Day, it just might be as important as ever to consider the true meaning of church/state separation and religious freedom.
Congress’s 1992 resolution that made Jan. 16 as Religious Freedom Day — a designation reaffirmed by every President since — was based on the anniversary of the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, originally authored by Thomas Jefferson. This act inspired and shaped the guarantees of religious liberty eventually found in the First Amendment.
The text of the 1786 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom gives great insight into our nation’s First Amendment right. It reads: “… no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced … in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.”
In short, the act affirmed what we should recognize in every era: the right to practice any faith, or to have no faith, is a foundational freedom for all Americans. This right is also behind what Jefferson meant when he spoke of a “wall of separation” between the church and the state.
Jefferson’s famous phrase came in an 1801 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut. The Baptists were worried about the freedom to practice their faith, writing to Jefferson that “what religious privileges we enjoy, we enjoy as favors granted, and not as inalienable rights,” which is “inconsistent with the rights of freemen.”
Jefferson wrote back that religious liberty, free from state tampering, would be a key part of the American vision. The Constitution, he wrote, would “restore to man all his natural rights.” In this same letter, Jefferson explained the intent of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which reads: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…” This, he said, built a “wall of separation of church and state.”
Jefferson was not suggesting that religious people or religious motivations should be exiled from public debate. As a matter of fact, the letter was from a religious people appealing to an elected official for their rights — an elected official who, by the way, attended church services during his administration inside the United States Capitol.
In its day, a constitutional prohibition that the state would not establish or restrain personal faith was truly revolutionary. Sadly, in many countries today, religious freedom is still revolutionary. America has the obligation to live this truth and demonstrate the depth of this powerful human right.
Unlike many places in the world, our government is not prohibited from referencing or accommodating religion, nor is the government compelled to scrub all religious references from the public square. Rather, the First Amendment ensures both that the government does not show preference to a certain religion and that the government does not take away an individual’s ability to exercise religion. In other words, the church should not rule over the state, and the state cannot rule over the church. Religion is too important to be a government program or a political pageant.
Thankfully, the Courts have affirmed this time and time again.
In 2014, the Supreme Court held in Town of Greece v. Galloway that “it is an elemental First Amendment principle that government may not coerce its citizens to support or participate in any religion or its exercise.”
In the recent Trinity Lutheran case, the Court held “that denying a generally available benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion… The exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.”
These cases not only explain the religion clauses of the First Amendment, but they also affirm the separation of church and state. In Town of Greece, the Court was clear that the government cannot coerce someone to participate in a particular religion, but it also should not attempt to restrict all acts of faith from the public square. The concept of a “separation of church and state” reinforces the legal right of a free people to freely live their faith, even in public; without fear of government coercion. Free exercise means you may have a faith and you may live it.
Before he died, Thomas Jefferson left instructions that in his grave’s epitaph, he wished to be remembered for three things — one of them being the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. On Religious Freedom Day, we should do just that, look back with gratitude for a nation that guarantees a free church in a free state. Separation of church and state doesn’t shut down our debates over religion in the public square; it guarantees the freedom for us to respectfully have those debates. Faith is worth talking about in many places in American culture and, yes, maybe even at the dinner table.", religion

Thomas S. Monson, president of the Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter Day Saints, died on Jan. 2 at the age of 90, the Church announced.
Monson, who was named the Church’s 16th president in 2008, died at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah, the church-affiliated Deseret News reported. His death was announced by a church spokesperson and on the organization’s official Twitter feed.

Testimonials poured in praising the “bear-hugging” Monson’s approachable and down-to-earth manner, which he retained even as he rose through the hierarchy of the 16-million-strong Church over the course of his 50 year career. Under Monson’s aegis, the Church’s threefold mission — proclaim the gospel, perfect the saints, and redeem the dead — was bolstered by a fourth, “outreach to the poor and less fortunate,” Stuart Reid, a former state legislator, told The Salt Lake Tribune.
“More than anything else during a lifetime of ministry, President Monson will be known for his charitable acts,” Reid said.
The Mormon Church, as the LDS is also known, also faced “some of the most intense public scrutiny in its history” under Monson’s decade-long tenure as the church’s senior figure, the Tribune wrote, including the rise of a Mormon president candidate — former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney — and a controversial decision on marriage equality that saw same-sex couples excommunicated from the Church.

In January 2011, my husband, son and I went to church for the first time. We’d chosen an Episcopal parish for our potential spiritual home. At the communion rail, I tried to get Tain, then 6 years old, to dip his wafer into the wine, but he wanted to chew on the morsel dry and then sip from the cup. A woman lowered the silver chalice to his lips. Tain tasted the wine and recoiled. He didn’t spit it out — a relief — but his face exploded with disgust, and he rose from the kneeling cushion with his mouth open, his tongue hanging out. My husband took him to the bathroom to wash away the sting.
Already I was wondering what we’d gotten ourselves into.
We were there because I had jumped on Tain’s innocent query, “What’s Sunday school and can I go?”
“Yes!” I said. “What a great idea! We’ll all go!”
I know personal faith is important, and I wanted Tain to understand his own. But let’s not kid ourselves: developing a spiritual life for your child in this boisterously secular world is kind of like being Noah building the ark. You have the feeling people are looking at you strangely. What do you need that for? That thing is huge, unwieldy, unnecessary. What a waste of time! 
There’s little to counteract this attitude — especially when Sundays are taken up with sports and homework. The concept of Sabbath went out the window long ago. But psychologist Lisa Miller insists there is scientific support for raising children with religion. The research in her book The Spiritual Child showed that children who have “a positive, active relationship to spirituality are…”
Still, the secular world presses in. Building that ark can feel like a quixotic endeavor. But here’s the thing:
Eventually, it will rain. And for my family, it fell torrentially.
Nearly two years after that first communion, Tain was sitting in his third-grade classroom in Sandy Hook Elementary when a gunman blasted his way into the building and killed 26 adults and children — including Tain’s godbrother, Ben. I barely have words for the grief that washed over us. We lived in an ocean of tears. I thought my heart would turn to stone, and I would sink forever.
One night, not long after the tragedy, I was putting Tain to bed, and I asked how he was doing, how he was feeling about Ben. I wasn’t sure if this was the right thing to ask, and I didn’t know what he would say. But he looked at me, his brown eyes wide with wonder.
“Mama, I just have the feeling I’m going to see Ben again. He’s going to come down from heaven, and he’s going to be here with all of us.”
“Yes,” I told him. “I think you’re right.”
I realized this is what faith does: It provides buoyancy, allowing you to rise to the surface and not drown in grief. In our ark we have a community including our pastor, family and friends who support us and affirm this sense of grace and God’s message that says, as the Christian writer Frederick Buechner put it, “Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid. I am with you.”
I believe all children have some connection to a higher power. It’s just a matter of encouraging them to know it is real and giving them a space to explore it. But even so, I was surprised by how quickly Tain grasped it and could call upon his faith as a source of strength and comfort.
I know many parents are at a loss as to how to help their children develop faith, especially if their own is wanting. All I can suggest is this: begin. Whatever your religion or spiritual orientation, just start walking the path. You’ll see right away it’s neither straight nor perfect. But in a world that does little to prepare us for devastating loss nor for appreciating life’s light and joy, it’s a path that makes sense.", religion

Pope Francis said the death penalty is “inadmissible” and called for changes to church doctrine to prohibit it, the church’s strongest comments yet on the controversial issue.
“It must be strongly stated that condemning a person to the death penalty is an inhumane measure,” Francis said Thursday at a conference in the Vatican, CNN reports.
The event was held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Catholic Catechism, a guide for teaching church doctrine published under Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, lending significance to Francis’ suggestion that the rules be altered.
Both of his predecessors, John II and Benedict XVI, spoke out against the death penalty, but Francis’ comments were the strongest yet, calling for possible changes to the Church’s doctrine.
“Doctrine cannot be conserved without allowing it to progress,” Francis said, further recommending that the church’s principles should be allowed to evolve over time.
The Catholic Church currently allows the death penalty but says cases whereby capital punishment is deemed an “absolute necessity” are “very rare if not practically nonexistent.”
U.S. Catholics are strongly divided on the issue: 43% support the death penalty, while 46% are opposed, according to a 2016 Pew Research Poll.", religion

Brigham Young University has ended a decades-long policy barring caffeinated soft drinks from its campus.
To those unfamiliar with the practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that may not seem like a big deal. But to Mormons, students and alumni, the decision is so earth-shattering that some on social media have come to the conclusion that the end of the world must indeed be near.
BYU, which is owned by the Church, will now serve sodas on its Provo, Utah, campus as a result of increased demand, perhaps due to clarifications over what drinks can be consumed by members of the Church. The school decided against selling caffeinated soft drinks in the mid-1950s, and did not receive requests to do so until recently, according to a post on BYU’s Dining Services website.
It’s happening. https://t.co/ZjomHCrYCo pic.twitter.com/KOyikaZ0l4

Members of the Church follow a dietary code called the Word of Wisdom, which prohibits the consumption of beverages like alcohol and “hot drinks,” which have been interpreted as coffee and tea. But in a 2012 post correcting news reports on the subject, Church officials said the guidelines had been misinterpreted to suggest that it bans the consumption of all caffeinated beverages, including soft drinks. “The Church revelation spelling out health practices does not mention the use of caffeine,” officials wrote at the time.
The clarification spurred discussion within the Mormon community, since some practitioners view drinking any caffeinated beverages as forbidden — a practice that was further perpetuated by outsider stereotypes of the religion. That confusion was furthered by BYU’s longstanding decision not to sell caffeinated beverages, according to the Salt Lake City Tribune. But prohibiting the sale of those drinks was “not a university or a church decision, but made by dining services, based on what our customers want,” a school spokesperson told the Tribune in 2012.
Now, some soft drinks are already for sale on campus, with more on the way, the school said. To some, that’s cause for celebration. To others, it’s unbelievable.

The following story is excerpted from TIME's special edition, The Science of Happiness, which is available at Amazon.
It’s right there, the first of the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha: “Existence is suffering.” If that’s not your bag, you can turn to the wisdom of Ecclesiastes, the preacher who said, “I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.” In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells his disciples the parable of the rich man who built a prosperous life, only to hear from God, “ ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’"" Across the spectrum of organized religions, the message is clear: the observant should be prepared for their allotment of unhappiness in this mortal vale of tears and put their faith in a happier life to come.
Which should perhaps make it surprising that scientists have found, again and again, that those with a spiritual practice or who follow religious beliefs tend to be happier than those who don’t. Study after study has found that religious people tend to be less depressed and less anxious than nonbelievers, better able to handle the vicissitudes of life than nonbelievers. A 2015 survey by researchers at the London School of Economics and the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands found that participating in a religious organization was the only social activity associated with sustained happiness—even more than volunteering for a charity, taking educational courses or participating in a political or community organization. It’s as if a sense of spirituality and an active, social religious practice were an effective vaccine against the virus of unhappiness.
I’ve experienced that phenomenon for myself. A few years ago, suffering a mix of anxiety and depression—or maybe just the toll of living too long in New York City—I made an appointment with a psychiatrist. I thought I might end up taking antidepressants, as more than 13% of Americans do. But before going down the drug route, my doctor prescribed something different—a morning meditation routine, to calm the kind of racing thoughts that can lead to a downward spiral.
I’m not sure if it was the calming effects of steady, deep breathing. Or the mental training that comes with meditation—focusing on the present moment rather than getting caught up in regrets about the past or fears about the future. Or the fact that even though I was doing it alone, the app I used to time myself told me how many other people were meditating at the same time I was, making me feel a part of a community of people who also struggled to find that inner calm. Whatever it was, it worked.
It turns out my story is not unusual; a review published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that even small amounts of meditation training can help with anxiety, depression and pain. But that doesn’t mean scientists know exactly why it works.
The same goes for the protective qualities of religious belief and spirituality. Some experts think that believing in a religion gives you a greater sense of purpose and meaning in life than a secular viewpoint alone does, and that can help carry you through the low periods and elevate the higher ones. It could be that belief in an afterlife—something nearly all mainstream religions have in common—can make you happier in this one, knowing that you’re headed for something better. (This would be the opiate that Karl Marx believed religion offers to the oppressed masses.) Jesus told his faithful their “reward is great in heaven,” but that promise seems to pay off in the here and now as well.
Indeed, there appears to be something to the idea that faith makes us happier. And it appears that one of the main reasons is that there’s strength in numbers.
Many religions proscribe vices that over time can damage health and, with it, happiness. For instance, Mormons—who aren’t allowed to smoke or to drink alcohol or caffeine—tend to have much lower mortality rates than nonobservers, and much the same is true for abstaining Seventh-day Adventists, who follow vegetarian diets and don’t drink. “Thou shalt not” may seem like a bummer, but scientists have come to understand that the abundance of possible decisions in a free, consumer-driven society can actually weigh us down. (It even has a term, popularized by Swarthmore College psychology professor Barry Schwartz: “the paradox of choice.”) It’s possible that the strictures of religion can help relieve that burden—especially if those strictures, and the religious community that enforces them, discourage unhealthy behaviors.
When it comes to religion and spirituality, it may not be what you believe or how you believe it that protects you from unhappiness so much as the fact that you believe at all—and that you practice those beliefs with other people. Scientists have long known that having strong social ties is one of the greatest guarantors of happiness. Religion isn’t the only social tie that binds—you can join a volunteer group or a bowling league or the parent-teacher association, and you’ll likely be better off than you would be alone.
As anyone who grew up religious knows, though, there’s something about ties of faith that make them particularly sticky. We can grow out of school ties or a hobby or an allegiance to a sports team—less so our faith. Religion derives from the Latin term religio, which means “to bind together.” Atomistic individuals are linked to family—family now and their ancestors—along with friends and community and congregation. It’s not for nothing that Jesus told some of the earliest Christians that “where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among them.”
Without that sense of community, religion may not be as strong a protector against unhappiness. In a survey of U.S. adults conducted in 2006 and 2007, researchers led by sociologist Chaeyoon Lim of the University of Wisconsin–Madison found that 33% of those who attended religious services every week and reported having close friends at church said they were extremely satisfied with their lives, while only 19% of those who went to church but had no close connections to the congregation reported the same satisfaction.
“To me, the evidence substantiates that it is not really going to church and listening to sermons that makes people happier,” Lim told TIME, “but making church-based friends and building intimate social networks there.”
In fact, it’s those who are suffering the most in this life who seem to benefit the most from the protective quality of religious community. In a 2011 paper that analyzed self-reports from hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, researchers found that the connection between religious faith and happiness was strongest among people living in difficult conditions—fear, poverty, hunger.
Think of it as scientific proof of the old saying that there are no atheists in the foxhole. When life is hard, the communal support of a religious community—and, presumably, the hope for something better to come in an entirely different world—is especially valuable, maybe even impossible to give up. That may be one reason religious community was so important to slave populations throughout history, from the ancient Israelites under the pharaoh’s boot in Egypt to African Americans trapped in the antebellum South. It may also be why even now in the U.S., states with lower life expectancies and higher poverty rates have the largest proportion of religious people. A rich man may find it harder to get into heaven than a camel does passing through the eye of a needle, but he may not think he needs to count on heaven in the first place.
In well-off but secular countries such as France and the Netherlands, both the religious and the nonreligious report about the same level of happiness and social support. In fact, Gallup data shows that some of the happiest nations in the world—Nordic countries such as Denmark and Sweden, which perennially score high on well-being—are comparatively abundant in atheists. Being completely unreligious—and presumably not worrying much about any kind of afterlife—didn’t seem to stop them from enjoying this life.
You don’t need to be a Marxist to believe that materialism matters to happiness and that people who live in a safe and wealthy country are on the whole going to be happier than those who do not. (If religion provides a kind of existential security in poor countries, the welfare state may do the same in rich ones.) The comparatively low levels of inequality in those unreligious Nordic nations likely play a role too.
Studies also point to the fact that the protective social qualities of religion work best in societies where religion is widely practiced. In other words, it’s important to get right not just with God but with your fellow man. In a fairly religious country like the U.S., it makes sense that being religious would make you happier—you’re with the majority, and studies have repeatedly shown that being in the minority is potentially stressful.
The opposite is true in a country such as the Netherlands, where atheism is widespread. There, a practicing religious person would be in the minority, and instead of that warm communality with your fellow believer, you’d find yourself out of step. Those religious social ties are weaker—and with them, the protective qualities of spirituality.
Another report, from the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that people living in an area with a higher density of co-religionists are more likely to participate in religious activities. There’s also a strong correlation between that religion density and positive economic outcomes, including higher incomes, lower rates of divorce and a higher likelihood of having a college degree. The value of religion depends in part on the cultural values behind it.
Of course, aren’t these concerns all a bit worldly for something that should be a matter of the spirit, not economic statistics?
The idea that happiness should be the goal of religion is a fairly recent one, and it would have been unrecognizable to the stern Protestants who landed on Plymouth Rock, who believed that the point of existence was the glorification of God—not human happiness. That’s the past, though; today, many of the descendants of those flinty Protestants now preach the prosperity gospel, which explicitly links material success in this life to God’s grace. In this telling, religion doesn’t just deliver community—it can deliver cold, hard cash.
And while the prosperity gospel may be an extreme version, other spiritual practices today explicitly teach happiness as a goal. One of the best-selling books written by the Dalai Lama is called The Art of Happiness. In it, the Buddhist leader describes why happiness is so important. “Isn’t a life based on seeking personal happiness by nature self-centered, even self-indulgent?” he writes. “Not necessarily. In fact, survey after survey has shown that it is unhappy people who tend to be most self-focused and are often socially withdrawn, brooding and even antagonistic.”
Happiness in this worldview isn’t just a possible by-product of religion—it’s practically a duty. But maybe this isn’t about religion so much as it is about those underlying cultural values. Howard Cutler, a psychiatrist who co-authored the book with the Dalai Lama, has said he suggested that it not open with the rather unhappy first Noble Truth that “existence is suffering.”
“I began with the more positive states and made my way into how we all want to be happy but have to deal with suffering,” Cutler told TIME. “It was very American.”", religion

In a groundbreaking address to the American Psychological Association in 1998, Martin Seligman called for the creation of “positive psychology,” a reoriented science that focused less on individual’s defects and more on their successful qualities — optimism, hardiness and the capacity for growth. The explosion of research into happiness and mindfulness that followed brought renewed attention to timeless thinkers like Confucius, Mencius and Marcus Aurelius.
But even this welcome attention to the past missed what may be the signature example of positive psychology in the ancient world. Adam and Eve are near-perfect role models for the healthy, resilient, loving relationship we all say we crave.
I spent the last few years traveling in the footsteps of history’s first couple, from the Garden of Eden in Iraq to the Sistine Chapel to Mae West’s Hollywood, trying to figure out what the first relationships can teach us about relationships today.
What I found is that Adam and Eve introduced the idea of love into the West. They were the first to grapple — sometimes successfully, other times not — with the central mystery of being alive: being un-alone.
Yet instead of celebrating this achievement, history has blamed them for bringing sin, lust, even death into the world. This is the greatest character assassination ever.
More important, it’s allowed us to overlook that the earliest figures to grapple with a long-term relationship embody the exact qualities that the latest research suggests we all need to follow. So what can Adam and Eve teach us about love?
1. The Power of Connectivity.
A seminal findings of positive psychology is that relationship are central to well-being. George Valliant, who ran the famed Grant Study of 268 men at Harvard, said the 75 years and $20 million expended point to “a straightforward five-word conclusion: ‘Happiness is love. Full stop.’”
At the same time, the biggest threat to happiness is feeling isolated, left out, alone. Those with higher rates of loneliness have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and hostility, along with increased rates of dying from heart disease, cancer, and every other cause of death studied. Social isolation is on par with high blood pressure, obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking as a risk factor for illness and early death.
Why? John Cacioppo of the University of Chicago has shown that being lonely triggers cellular changes in the body that make the immune system less able to protect vital organs.
The first thing God says about human beings in the Bible, after creating Adam, is “It’s not right for humans to be alone.” Hebrew Scripture got there 3,000 years before modern science. From Eve’s risky reach for knowledge to the unbearable pain of losing a child at the hand of another, the first couple are constantly wrestling with loneliness.
God clearly wants them to find refuge in each other. The aching question: Can they find a way?
2. The Need for Autonomy.
Another pillar of psychology is that being emotionally healthy requires a high degree of self-directedness. Edward Deci, of the University of Rochester and the founder of this line of thinking, told me that hundreds of studies across culture, gender and age have shown that people prefer being motivated from within and need to feel autonomous.
This, too, is a major theme of Adam and Eve. The two begin life crazy for each other. Eve is “the one,” Adam enthuses. But Eve craves independence, wanders off and eats the fruit. Since the text says she gains knowledge with this act, Deci thinks she’s seeking more meaning. “For Eve, eating the fruit appears to be an autonomous choice.”
The same applies to Adam, who given the option to eat, chooses companionship over duty. “He makes the autonomous decision to be with Eve,” Deci said.
Only when Adam and Eve face death alone can they face life together. “Learning to be oneself,” wrote Thomas Merton, “means learning to die in order to live.” Only when they fall from grace can they fully fall in love with each other.
3. The Importance of Co-Narration.
The great Swiss child psychologist Piaget coined the phrase “collective monologue” to describe how preschoolers play, meaning they gather together but talk only to themselves. Love is the opposite of this. It’s “collective dialogue.” Two voices construct a shared story.
Creating this shared story — what psychologists call “co-narration” — is the last great quality of romantic love, and the one Adam and Eve are most responsible for introducing. From the moment God divides them in two, they alone are responsible for writing their own narrative. Theirs is the first joint byline.
This need to author your own intermingled experience is the final lesson from the oldest couple: Love is a story we tell with another person. It’s co-creation through co-narration.
And it’s a reminder that sometimes the timeliest wisdom comes from timeless sources. Adam and Eve are the first love story. The story we need today.", religion

When 19 college guys go to Jamaica for spring break, they usually hit the bar and the beach.
Not Nicholas Morrison and his friends. Their trip to Montego Bay this March was far more medieval. Every morning they rose at 5:30 a.m. and prayed. Then they visited abandoned children with disabilities and dug an irrigation trench to protect the kids’ homes from flooding in the coming summer rains.
The young men joked as they moved 100 lb. boulders without machinery, naming one rock “Happy Birthday” and another “JP2,” a nickname for Pope John Paul II. Their chosen spring-break hashtag? #SemsOnMission.
Morrison and his friends are Catholic seminarians, studying to become priests. Philosophy majors at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., they live and study at the nearby St. John Paul II Seminary, which opened six years ago to meet a growing demand from millennial men who want to join the priesthood.
Millennial priests are products of the Church, and the 21st century. They use Facebook and Snapchat, and text their friends funny GIFs. Some brew their own beer, protest at Black Lives Matter rallies, or go to the shooting range with Marine buddies. Some are comfortable with legalizing recreational pot.
They are more likely to wear their clerical attire than jeans in public, faster to share details of their prayer life than to keep them private and keener to give their Friday nights to the homeless than to Netflix. When it comes to politics, they are hard to pin down as liberal or conservative, and not all think preaching antiabortion homilies is a good idea.
Instead they speak openly with their supervisors about their struggles with chastity, and some even discuss their struggles with sexual orientation. Perhaps most importantly, there are more than there were before: 1,900 men under age 30 were enrolled in graduate-level Catholic seminaries in 2016, up from 1,300 in 2005, according to Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. This June the next wave of graduates packs up to move to churches across the nation.
This shift comes at a time when Pope Francis, who became the Pontiff in 2013, is calling for a new kind of priest to serve in parishes across the world. His papacy is just four years old, and the millennial priests are not a homogeneous group, but already, they share a mission.
Forget the old stereotypes of the priesthood—reserved men, removed and dogmatic, who present themselves at the lectern to guide their congregations. The next generation heeding the Francis call looks a lot like Father Chris Seith, the parochial vicar at Our Lady of Mercy in Potomac, Md. Seith, now 28, does CrossFit, rides a bike through the halls of his parish’s Catholic school donning a goofy fake mustache and gondolier’s hat to greet all the students, and bakes cakes on Catholic feast days to encourage people to celebrate holy days as real parties.
Pope Francis’ mission of mercy and first major writing, The Joy of the Gospel, guides his purpose. “Joy is contagious, energy is contagious,” Seith says. “I just want to be the face of that joy.”

Last year, a gunman stormed into the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, a place frequented by many in the gay community, and killed 49 people. It was the largest mass murder in US history. In response, many religious leaders expressed sympathy for the people of Orlando, as well as for the LGBTQ community.
Many Catholic leaders did the same. But of the over 250 Catholic bishops in this country, only a handful mentioned the words gay or LGBTQ. It was as if speaking those words would signal a tacit approval of a group that the Catholic Church has long held at arm’s length. 
To me, it was a confirmation of what many Catholics already knew: There is no group more marginalized in the church today than the LGBTQ community. Even in death they remained invisible.
In my almost 30 years as a Jesuit, I have heard the most appalling stories of LGBTQ people being ignored, excluded and insulted by the church. Last week I received a message from someone who said that a gay friend of hers was dying in a hospice in the Southwest US. Did I know, she wondered, a priest who would pray with him? The priest assigned to the hospice, she said, was refusing to. Because he was gay.
How unchristian this is! And how unlike what Jesus would want us to do. 
In some parts of the Gospels, Jesus’s actions remain somewhat mysterious. Or open for interpretation. And the question “What would Jesus do?” can occasionally be hard to answer. But one thing about his ministry is clear: Jesus continually reached out to people who were on the margins of society–men and women who were ignored, excluded and insulted. Much like LGBTQ people are today. 
The Gospel of Luke recounts the story of Zacchaeus, the chief tax collector in the ancient city of Jericho. In that time and culture, because he would have been colluding with Rome, he would also have been seen as the “chief sinner” in the city. Zacchaeus, described as “short in stature,” climbs a sycamore tree to “see who Jesus was,” as the miracle worker from Nazareth passed through his town. 
When Jesus spies the tax collector perched in the tree, he doesn’t shout out, “Sinner!” He says something more surprising. “Hurry and come down,” says Jesus, “for I must stay at your house today.”
 What’s he doing? He is offering Zacchaeus a public sign of welcome. 
The townspeople “grumble,” the Gospel tells us. They don’t like what Jesus is doing. In response, Zacchaeus “stands his ground” and says he will repay all his debts. So for Jesus, it is usually community first, conversion second. Welcome comes first. 
Catholics are growing in their recognition of the need to welcome their LGBTQ brothers and sisters. Why? Mainly because more of their family members and friends are coming out, and being open about their sexuality and identity. A few decades ago many Catholics would have considered themselves “safe” from the “problem” of LGBTQ people. No longer.
A few months ago, after a talk at Yale University’s Catholic Center, an elderly woman approached me. With white hair and a twinkle in her eye, she looked like the quintessential grandmother. I had just given a lecture on a book I had written on Jesus, so I thought that she would say something like, “I just made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.” Or “Let me tell you my favorite Gospel passage.” Instead she said something surprising.
“Father,” she said, “my grandchild is transgender, and I love her so much. All I want for her is to know that God loves her, and that she’s welcome in our church.” 
A few years ago, her grandchild may never have shared that with her. So for this elderly woman the issue of LGBTQ people might have remained one that did not touch her life. But today more and more Catholics are affected. 
This means that ministering to LGBTQ Catholics means ministering not simply to the relatively small percentage of Catholics who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, but to a whole constellation of people touched by the issue: grandparents and parents, aunts and uncles, sisters and brothers, college roommates, coworkers, friends and fellow parishioners. 
Why should Catholics accept and love LGBTQ people? For countless reasons, but let me suggest three. First, they are our brothers and sisters. Second, Jesus would ask us to reach out specifically to those who feel they are on the margins, and today this means LGBTQ person. 
Third, and most importantly, for Jesus there is no one who is outside the community. There is no one who is “other.” For Jesus, there is no us and them. There is only us.", religion

When 19 college guys go to Jamaica for spring break, they usually hit the bar and the beach. Not Nicholas Morrison and his friends. Their trip to Montego Bay this March was far more medieval.
Every morning they rose at 5:30 a.m. and prayed. Then they visited abandoned children with disabilities and dug an irrigation trench to protect the kids’ homes from flooding in the coming summer rains. The young men joked as they moved 100 lb. boulders without machinery, naming one rock “Happy Birthday” and another “JP2,” a nickname for Pope John Paul II. Their chosen spring-break hashtag? #SemsOnMission.
Morrison and his friends are Catholic seminarians, studying to become priests. Philosophy majors at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., they live and study at the nearby St. John Paul II Seminary, which opened six years ago to meet a growing demand from millennial men who want to join the priesthood. It has reached capacity at 50 students and is already expanding, for the second time. “The four years I have been there have been totally incredible,” says Morrison, 22, a 2017 graduate from Maryland who is headed to Rome to continue his studies. “I’m much more confident that this is something that the Lord wants me to continue to pursue.”

The precise way that Morrison and his generation choose to pursue their calling is what sets them apart. Products of the 21st century, they use Facebook and Snapchat, and text their friends funny GIFs. Some brew their own beer, protest at Black Lives Matter rallies or go to the shooting range with Marine buddies. Some are comfortable with legalizing recreational pot. They are more likely to wear their clerical attire than jeans in public, faster to share details of their prayer life than to keep them private and keener to give their Friday nights to the homeless than to Netflix. When it comes to politics, they are hard to pin down as liberal or conservative, and not all think preaching antiabortion homilies is a good idea. Instead they speak openly with their supervisors about their struggles with chastity, and some even discuss their struggles with sexual orientation. Perhaps most important, there are more of them now than there were before: 1,900 men under age 30 were enrolled in graduate-level Catholic seminaries in 2016, up from 1,300 in 2005, according to Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA). In June the next wave of graduates will finish and pack up to move to churches across the nation.
This shift comes at a time when Pope Francis, who became the Pontiff in 2013, is calling for a new kind of priest to serve in parishes around the world. His predecessor was known as a scholar, but Francis is renowned as a pastor for the people. For the first time in 30 years, the Vatican this past winter revised its global guidelines for educating priests, and modeled it after Pope Francis’ example of humility and vision for accessible and genuine leaders. He is open to the idea of studying how some married men can be ordained to serve in a priestly function, to serve in rural areas short on ministers. Next year he will call the world’s bishops to Rome for a summit to discuss youth, faith and vocational discernment. As they prepare, he is asking Catholics “not to yield to discouragement” but to pray for the new priests to be “living signs of God’s merciful love.” Millennial priests are the cutting edge of his effort. The Pope makes a point to visit young seminarians when he travels to different countries, as he did in Philadelphia in 2015. “Pope Francis has been a game changer,” Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago says. “He’s made people rethink their aspirations for the priesthood.”
Francis’ papacy is just four years old, and the millennial priests are not a homogeneous group, but already they share a mission. Forget the old stereotypes of the priesthood–reserved men, removed and dogmatic, who present themselves at the lectern to guide their congregations. The generation heeding the Francis call looks a lot like Father Chris Seith, the parochial vicar at Our Lady of Mercy in Potomac, Md. Seith, now 28, does CrossFit, rides a bike through the halls of his parish’s Catholic school donning a goofy fake mustache and gondolier’s hat to greet all the students, and bakes cakes on Catholic feast days to encourage people to celebrate holy days as real parties. Pope Francis’ mission of mercy and first major writing, The Joy of the Gospel, guides his purpose. “Joy is contagious, energy is contagious,” Seith says. “I just want to be the face of that joy.”
To find a Pope Francis–style pastor in Chicago, you need look no further than Father Matt O’Donnell. O’Donnell, 30, was the youngest-known pastor in the archdiocese’s history when he got the job to lead St. Columbanus Church four years ago, just months after Francis’ election. The parish is mostly African American, and it sits between two of the most violent neighborhoods on the South Side. In February, when an 11-year-old girl was shot and killed blocks away, O’Donnell went to the scene to find her family.
The neighborhood is not Catholic, and neither was the girl. But O’Donnell offered to help her mother with funeral costs, and then he attended the memorial. “I get to be a pastor for a whole lot of people besides those who just come on Sunday morning to mass here,” he says. “My hope is that people realize that St. Columbanus is a place that’s trying to provide more opportunities for the community around economic development, jobs and food insecurity.”
The rise of millennial leaders like O’Donnell comes at a critical moment for the Catholic Church in the U.S., where congregants are declining as a share of the population. Even among millennials who are Catholic, only about a quarter attend church weekly, and three-quarters of younger millennial Catholics support same-sex marriage in defiance of church teaching, according to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center.
The church also faces an overall priest shortage in the U.S. The number of priests in the country has dropped from 58,600 to 37,200 over the past 50 years, and a whopping 3,500 parishes did not have their own pastor in 2016, according to CARA. That means that while young priests like O’Donnell might in the past have worked for a decade or two as an assistant before leading their own congregation, young priests now must take on more responsibility sooner and with fewer resources. No generation may ever be able to repeat the post–World War II priest boom, when droves of men were ordained at the average age of 28 and fewer laypeople could serve in leadership roles. But the share of men under age 29 who enter Catholic seminary has risen 15% in the past 15 years, according to CARA, and the average ordination age has fallen from 37 to 34.
The new priests represent a cultural change in the church. For the first time, the next generation of Latino Catholics in the U.S. is larger than that of white Catholics. Only seven in 10 of the newest priests in the U.S. are white, compared with more than 9 in 10 U.S. priests overall, according to CARA. In Chicago, where 44% of Catholics but only 14% of priests are Latino, church leadership is recruiting young priests with brochures that read, Sé un líder. Sé un héroe. ¡Sé un sacerdote! (Be a leader. Be a hero. Be a priest!) As part of their studies, seminarians often learn Spanish. In Silver Spring, Md., Father Mario Majano, 30, says many immigrants question the choice to become a priest because of expectations that the next generation should help the family advance economically. “How can I be a source of stability for my family in a different, good way?” Majano recalls thinking about his decision to become a priest. “I wish we had more young Hispanics.”
All this leaves bishops looking to millennials for new leadership. Bishop Timothy Senior, who leads St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, near Philadelphia, says, “The style of the priesthood absolutely has to change” to elevate “servant leadership.” In Chicago, Cupich, 68, invited O’Donnell and Father James Wallace, 31, to be on the steering committee for the archdiocese’s strategic outlook plan, called Renew My Church, to explore how parishes should function in the future. They hosted a dinner in February for the archdiocese’s other young priests to discuss how to make the church more vibrant in their city. “The demands on their leadership are going to be altogether different from their predecessors’, ” Cupich explains. “What distresses them the most is that there might be a leadership sometimes that says, We’re just going to kick the cans down the road and not deal with them. We’re not going to worry about buildings that have huge capital needs or shrinking numbers of parishioners.”
Pope Francis has encouraged the shift. He tells church leaders to put their community first, avoid clerical bureaucracy and, above all, evangelize with kindness. In November he elevated two key American archbishops to cardinals: Cupich, who is responsible for the largest Catholic seminary in the country, Mundelein Seminary at the University of St. Mary of the Lake; and Joseph Tobin of Newark, N.J., who leads the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ committee that is responsible for new priests. Both are important players for ensuring that the Francis vision takes root.
For young priests in Cupich’s Chicago, that vision already comes naturally. St. Columbanus, for example, is named for a 6th century Irish saint, but recently O’Donnell decided to rebrand to better serve his neighborhood. He put up new mosaics that imagine the church’s namesake with a black and brown face. Now he keeps the church baptismal font heated and full of water, ready for converts at any moment. “Pope Francis, he has made me excited again about becoming a priest,” O’Donnell says. “He models to me what I want to be as a priest, the ability to be creative, imaginative and not get stuck in what ‘has to be.'”
For many of the new generation, Pope Francis is just one of several key role models. It takes at least five years to be ordained, so most of the millennial priests of today chose their path before Francis was elected, and they owe a lot to the Popes of their youth, including John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Students at a recent Mundelein Seminary roundtable praised Pope Francis’ simplicity, calling his spirituality raw, hands-on and organic, a sentiment they say fellow millennials appreciate. But when they named their biggest spiritual influences, they did not name Popes or Vatican officials. Instead, they talked of pastors back home, mothers, friends and women like St. Teresa of Calcutta and St. Thérèse of Lisieux.
The newest priests see the priesthood as a rebellion, if an unusual one. Seminary programs often offer a technology fast, for a week or a year, and young men are quick to say how much they enjoy it. Like Pope Francis, many will take a selfie, but they caution against friendships that exist mainly on social media. The priesthood has largely resisted cultural change brought on by new family structures and a changing sense of community–most millennial seminarians have been Catholic since birth, have parents who are still married and celebrate the Eucharist every day. “They know they are going countercultural, but it is not out of ignorance,” Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, who founded the St. John Paul II Seminary, says. “There has to be some vision, some purpose, some goal.”
The next priesthood is bound by this strong sense of mission. Some seminarians may trade knowledge of bishops like baseball cards, but by the time they are in churches, they are more focused on outreach. Father Dominic Clemente, 27, of Chicago, started his church’s first ever youth program, filmed videos for the church’s website and hopes to develop a new relationship with the Muslim Community Center down the street.
Wallace, the 31-year-old on the Renew My Church team, calls himself socially progressive, but for him that means he’s not afraid to play dodgeball with the kids, do a shot of Jameson with off-duty cops at a St. Patrick’s Day party or sit on the front lawn with a cigar and an extra lawn chair so people will come and talk. “The big talk is evangelization … How do we go out and get people to fall in love with Christ?” says Wallace, of Edison Park in Chicago. “For a certain generation of priests, they weren’t trained with that concept, so evangelization is just totally foreign to them. It’s not that they are opposed to it; it’s just not on their radar.” Wuerl, 76, says the young generation is far more open about their prayer life and their encounters with God than he was at their age. “If you define humility as simply recognizing the truth, they are very humble people, because they have no problem talking about their own failures and their own accomplishments,” he says.
Sexuality, and their willingness to wrestle with it openly, also sets millennial priests apart from their predecessors. Pope Francis has reiterated that marriage is not an option for priests, and seminarians are required to refrain from sexual activity. But seminary leaders say young men are not afraid to confess struggles with pornography, and they discuss how their sexuality fits with their pledge of abstinence. “I think they’ve embraced that sense of, ‘I’m here to live a chaste life, whatever my sexual orientation might be,'” Father John Kartje, president of Mundelein Seminary, says. “That conversation doesn’t have an asterisk on it for one person as opposed to another.” Adds Father Jeffrey Eickhoff, who leads St. Gregory the Great Seminary near Lincoln, Neb.: “In some sense, scandal has happened, priests have failed. There’s not so much stigma that priests are perfect anymore.”
The child sex-abuse scandal defined the church of their parents, and young men are eager to turn the page. Seith, the Maryland CrossFitter, was a young teenager in 2002 when the scandal broke. When he applied to seminary, his program required that applicants complete a background check and a comprehensive psychological evaluation, and curriculums trained seminarians on how to report abuse. He says his classmates from dioceses like Boston, where the abuse numbers were particularly high, confronted more of a stigma than he did. But he also personally knew an abuse victim, and that makes him want to set the best example of a priest that he can, especially in his work at his local Catholic school. “We talked about, How do we make sure we are approachable and people can trust us?” he says of his training. “We want to make sure the kids know they are really loved.”
Even in a new era of openness, millennial priests have limits. They believe what the culture does not, that sex outside of heterosexual marriage is sinful and that Jesus rose from the dead. Young priests embrace institutions and rituals their millennial peers eschew. “People say, ‘Well, I can worship God in my bedroom, I can worship God from the bar, I can worship while I’m lying down watching Netflix,'” Father Michael Trail, 27, of Oak Forest, Ill., says. “But taking that solid time out of your week just to thank God for the way that he’s come in your life, that only happens with structure.”
Many young priests even take this conservatism to a new level. For some, the old mass of their grandparents is now hip and exotic. Students at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary host outreach events that replace Christian rock music with a very solemn, high mass, complete with incense. Many choose to wear their collar even on their off-days or when out at a bar to stand out, while their rector, Bishop Senior, says his seminary classmates 30 years ago would wear jackets and ties to fit in. In a speech to Polish Jesuits, Pope Francis even encouraged young seminarians to be less rigid, to avoid narcissism and to discern “shades of gray.”
Wallace says that unlike older priests, his peers are less willing to identify with a political party. Eickhoff, whose seminary draws from mostly red states, says young men are conservative on moral issues like marriage and abortion but push back against President Trump on immigration. And while pockets of church leaders may hope Rome’s pendulum will swing right after Pope Francis, these young men are more politically independent. “I don’t think we are in an age here in the United States where the young men are going archconservative,” says Father Robert Panke, rector of St. John Paul II Seminary.
In the months ahead, Pope Francis plans to spotlight this next generation. He has dedicated the next triennial bishops’ synod at the Vatican in October 2018 to discuss youth and vocation, which will cover both calls to the priesthood and to marriage. He has asked bishops worldwide to survey young people in advance, and the Vatican is planning a website for youth to submit reflections for the event. After the synod comes the 2019 World Youth Day in Panama, which he hopes will cement the synod’s reforms. At age 80, Francis knows that the future of the church depends on the direction millennial Catholics choose. “The church and society need you,” he told young people in a recent video message. “With your dreams and ideals, walls of stagnation fall and roads open up.”
For now, church leaders in the U.S. are hopeful that the Pope’s efforts will stick. “I say to the priests here, Anytime you’ve had a bad day, just go up to the seminary and see this next generation coming along,” Cardinal Wuerl says. The millennial priesthood is ready for the spotlight. “If we can keep those doors open for at least 100 years, we will be good,” Clemente says. “Hopefully the next guys behind us will use those open doors to continue welcoming people in.”

The Russian Supreme Court could declare the Jehovah’s Witnesses an extremist organization in a Wednesday hearing, a move that would lead to the seizure of the church’s headquarters near St. Petersburg and the outlawing of the group’s organized worship.
In advance of the hearing, international concern has grown. “If the Supreme Court rules in favour of the authorities, it will be the first such ruling by a court declaring a registered centralized religious organization to be ‘extremist,’” the UN human rights’ high commissioner’s office said in a statement on Tuesday.
The ruling would also cap off years of increased restrictions by the Russian Federation against minority religions. Last summer, Russia introduced an anti-terrorism law that also restricted evangelism, and a regional court ordered the deportation of six missionaries with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 2015, a court banned the Church of Scientology’s Moscow branch.
Under a Russian law passed in 1997, there is freedom of religion, but four faiths are designated to be traditional—Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism—and other religious organizations must register with the government. Some groups, like Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are registered, still face bureaucratic and legal hurdles. Jehovah’s Witness leaders estimate that there are 175,000 Russian-based adherents to the faith, which was founded in the United States the 1870s. Unlike Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that Jesus is the son of God but do not believe in the Trinity.
“They would basically be prosecuting Jehovah’s Witnesses as criminals,” David Semonian, international spokesperson for the Jehovah’s Witnesses, says of the pending court declaration. “Anyone who would actually would have our publications could be criminalized. It is of great concern.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses have filed a counter claim asking the court to rule the Justice Ministry’s actions as political repression. A ruling in favor of the ministry would make it a crime for Jehovah’s Witnesses to worship in the Russian Federation and dissolve the faith’s legal means to own or rent Kingdom Halls, their places of worship. In 2015, the Russian Federation banned the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ website JW.org, and customs officials stopped shipments of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Bibles, citing the possibility they were extremist literature. Last year, Russia threatened to close the group’s national headquarters.
Roman Lunkin, a human rights fellow at the Wilson Center and an expert on church-state relations in Russia, says that Russian authorities have been targeting minority religions as “extremists” in an effort to demonstrate support for the Russian Orthodox Church and to marginalize organizations with suspected pro-western sympathies. “The treatment of the Jehovah’s Witnesses reflects the Russian government’s tendency to view all independent religious activity as a threat to its control and the country’s political stability,” the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in a statement on Tuesday.
“Jehovah’s Witnesses are no threat to either the Russian Orthodox Church or to the Russian Government,” Semonian says. “The constitution guarantees freedom of worship, and that is all we are asking, to have the same rights as other religious groups have so we can go about our ministry in a peaceful way.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are pacifists, and their religious beliefs require them to abstain from political activity. They declare allegiance only to God, not to a state or political entity. They do not vote, lobby, protest, or join military. This lack of participation can be seen as a threat if a state demands nationalist and patriotic activity.
“The persecution of the Jehovah’s Witnesses is very much tied to the resurgence of a new view of nationalism, where everything within the state is fine, but anything outside of the state has to be crushed,” Kristina Arriaga de Bucholz, a U.S. commissioner for International Religious Freedom appointed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, says. “A pacifist group that tells its members that their allegiance is to something outside of the government is immediately a group that will be perceived as dangerous to the regime.”
Other minority Christian groups in Russia, like evangelicals, have not yet faced the same level of scrutiny. Lunkin says it is impossible to accuse evangelicals of extremist activity because their literature and Bible translation matches that of the Russian Orthodox Church. Jehovah’s Witnesses have their own translation of the Bible, and they also have their own magazine and educational materials. Evangelicals also have closer relationships with government officials, he says. “It’s [about] a protection of traditional religions, and the Orthodox identity of Russian people,” Lunkin says. “But in fact it is about protecting personal power, because the main fear is changing of regimes in Russia.”
Jehovah’s Witness church leadership has reached out to the U.S. State department’s Office of International Religious Freedom, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, and the U.S. Helsinki Commission for aid. “We will do everything within our legal means to have the judgment reversed,” Semonian says. “Jehovah’s Witnesses are known worldwide for our peaceful activities, and under no circumstances would we ever resort to violence or any other activity that could be misunderstood or considered extremist.”
Jehovah’s Witness leaders have also asked their eight million members worldwide to write letters to Russia officials, including President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, to ask them to intervene. Instructions tell writers to “be candid but respectful,” and to mention how the faith has benefited their families. “Keep in mind that ‘a mild answer turns away rage,’ and ‘a gentle tongue can break a bone,’” the instructions say, quoting the Biblical book of Proverbs.
The decision will come as the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom is finalizing its annual report identifying countries of concern, its first such report for the Trump administration. The Commission is a bipartisan government advisory group that makes policy recommendations to the President, Congress, and the Secretary of State.
Since 2009, the group has designated Russia as a “Tier 2” nation, on the watch list one step below countries of particular concern. “The fate of the Jehovah’s Witnesses is the fate of any religious group that does not pledge its allegiance to the Russian government,” Arriaga says. “April 5 will definitely mark a new chapter of religious persecution in post-Soviet Russia.”", religion

(SALT LAKE CITY) — Mormon leaders reminded church members Saturday about the importance of performing ceremonial baptisms on dead ancestors who didn’t receive the ordinance while alive.
Henry Eyring told a worldwide audience during a twice-yearly Mormon conference that God wants all his children to come “home again.” He encouraged listeners to use the religion’s massive genealogical database to trace their roots.
Ceremonial baptisms occur when a member brings an ancestor’s name to a temple. Mormons believe the ritual allows deceased people a way to the afterlife if they choose to accept it. The belief that families are sealed for eternity is one of the faith’s core tenets.
The practice is becoming more common than ever because of young church members who have embraced it, said Eyring, a member of a top governing body of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
“They have learned that this work saves not just the dead; it saves all of us,” Eyring said. “There are now many people who have accepted baptism in the spirit world. … This is the work of our generation.”
But ceremonial baptisms offend members of some other religions, especially Jews, who became upset years ago when they discovered attempts by Mormons to alter the religion of Holocaust victims. They included Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager forced into hiding in Amsterdam during the Holocaust and killed in a concentration camp.
In the 1990s, after negotiations with Jewish leaders, the church agreed to end the ceremonial baptism of Holocaust victims. After it was revealed that they continued, Mormon leaders in 2012 spoke out against the practice and reminded the public that a virtual firewall was put in the database to block anyone who tried to access the names of people who died in the Holocaust.
The “proxy baptisms” also were mentioned Saturday at the conference in a speech by Russell M. Nelson, another member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who is next in line to assume the church presidency. Nelson said Mormons who keep their covenants to Jesus Christ are given “Godly power.”
“God’s plan provides for those blessings to be extended to ancestors who died without an opportunity to obtain them during their mortal lives,” Nelson said.
Mark Bragg, a member of a secondary governing body, applauded the increase in baptisms for the deceased: “We are experiencing great joy and celebration on both sides of the veil.”
Their speeches came during a two-day conference in which leaders focus on a range of topics aimed at providing guidance and inspiration to the faith’s more than 15 million members worldwide.
Nearly 100,000 church members are expected to attend five sessions on Saturday and Sunday. Thousands more around the world will listen to the conference or watch it on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts in 90 different languages.
Dale Renlund, one of the newest members Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, told church members to guard against being intolerant of others with different opinions.
“We must not be guilty of persecuting anyone inside or outside the church,” Renlund said. “Church history gives ample evidence of our members being treated with hatred and bigotry. How ironically sad it would be if we were to treat others as we have been treated.”", religion

The best-selling author who walked the Holy Land talks about The First Love Story, married priests and the Bible's ringing endorsement of sex
You write that we have lost the point of Adam and Eve: they were two people who loved each other through passion and pain. Should we all disobey God on our first dates to build an eternal relationship?
Adam and Eve are victims of the greatest character assassination the world has ever known. And when you go back to the story, you find the first commandment that God gives in the entire Bible is to Adam and Eve: Go forth and multiply. They are called by God to succeed. The story is not one of disobeying God. It's about obeying the larger message, which is making the relationship work.
Why has Eve shouldered the blame when Adam was right there, taking a bite from the same fruit?
Because organized religion got ahold of the story — and by organized religion, I mean men. It has been weaponized essentially to keep down women. In the story, Eve is the first independent woman.
What did your reinvestigation of their creation reveal to you about gender?
Genesis introduces the idea of gender fluidity: God creates this ungendered human in God's image. That suggests that the first creation has male and female inside them.
What about sex?
The entire point of the story is fulfilling God's mission to be fruitful and multiply. The story needs them to succeed, and we need sex for that success to happen.
The Pope recently raised the possibility of allowing married men to serve as priests. What might they understand that celibate priests don't?
Anybody who has struggled to make their own relationship work will be more empathetic to somebody who is struggling with an enormous pain point: how to tell a story with another person. Love is co-creation through co-narration. The ""co-"" is central to that.
Last year's two most acclaimed films, Moonlight and La La Land, subverted the other love story central to Western society: the Hollywood romance. What should we reconsider about that tale?
That being in love is not a choice we make once; it's a choice we make multiple times. In Adam and Eve, the first key moment is not when they meet. It's when Eve eats the fruit and decides to go back to Adam, and Adam chooses companionship over duty — that's the second choice. When they leave Eden, that's the third choice. After their son Cain kills their son Abel, that's the biggest choice: showing resilience to have another child and fulfill God's mandate. What's the most loving moment in Hamilton? After he's cheated, after their son has been killed in a duel. In ""It's Quiet Uptown"" — I've listened to that song maybe 500 times, and it wasn't until I went back after this book that I heard the last lyric, ""Forgiveness, can you imagine?"" It's an act of imagination, an act of commitment and ultimately an act of love to re-choose someone after a difficult time. That choice is much harder and more important than the first.
Religion today is often used as a barrier — against the threat of terrorism or as a reason to not provide someone a service. What do you make of that?
We all have to get over that thing our mom told us: ""Don't talk about politics and religion in public."" The majority of people have yearnings and big questions and want to believe, but also want to coexist with people with whom they disagree, with whom they may also be sharing a bed or a table or a child. Those of us who are open-minded have to claim the microphone.
Coding class or Bible study?
I have daughters who love math. It's harder to tell them that there's more wisdom in the ancient world than on the computer. So, Bible study.", religion

At least 80 Roman Catholic dioceses across the United States have said it’s OK to enjoy corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick’s Day this year — despite the fact that the holiday falls on a Friday during Lent, when practicing Catholics are typically required to abstain from eating meat.
As of March 9, more than 80 of the nearly 200 dioceses in the U.S. had announced a St. Patrick’s Day exemption to the no-meat rule, according to the Catholic News Agency. That gives Catholics permission to eat corned beef and cabbage, a meal traditionally served in the U.S. on St. Patrick’s Day. Archdioceses in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco are among those that have granted a dispensation.
Exemption details differ by diocese, and Catholics have been advised to check in with their local parish. Some church leaders have asked Catholics to, instead, abstain from eating meat on another day this week or to perform an additional act of charity.
“If a Catholic residing in the Archdiocese of New Orleans wishes to participate in St. Patrick’s Day activities and desires to eat meat, they may be dispensed and choose another day of the week for abstinence or may choose to perform an act of penance that is a greater sacrifice,” New Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond said in a statement to priests reported by the Times-Picayune.
Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda, who leads the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minnesota, encouraged churchgoers to perform another act of penance, according to the Catholic News Service.
“When you get a dispensation — and I think it’s coming — you should do penance on another occasion,” Hebda said last month. “So, it’s like a get-out-of-jail-free card, but you have to pay sometime.”", religion

“Rend your hearts, not your garments!” These are the challenging words of the prophet Joel that will greet Christians in churches around the world as they mark the beginning of Lent with the celebration of Ash Wednesday.
Lent, too domesticated over time, is nothing short a radical ancient invitation to reject the emerging dictatorship of superficiality that too often sullies our lives and our communities and to take up a new path that celebrates authentic encounter and encourages our own our conversion and a transformation of the entire human race.
It’s a 40-day journey right to the heart of who we are and who we long to be.
Jesus, the great protagonist of this holy season, shows us that life and redemption aren’t achieved through strength and power but by rejecting privilege and taking up the sufferings of the entire human family. In Jesus, God takes on the fullness of human dysfunction — its disloyalty, its violence, and its terror — to redeem everything. He goes all the way down to bring everyone up. No one is excluded.
As a white heterosexual Christian man it’s a reminder that if I am to authentically honor the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ this holy season, I must acknowledge and reject the privilege afforded me for the sake of taking the path of Jesus Christ.
There’s nothing better for me to do this Lent than to abstain and fast from the sexism that too often colors my life.
Now, let’s set the record straight: there are those who are blatantly sexist and there are those who unintentionally perpetuate micro-acts of sexism in their everyday lives. I’m most certainly a sinner, but on my best days, I’m hopefully more of the latter than the former. And perhaps that’s more pernicious in a country where Donald Trump is President.
His election certainly reminds us that sexism still runs rampant in the world’s longest lasting democratic republic. But to pretend that this problem is spread equally throughout the nation is to ignore the reality that some communities and institutions are the greatest offenders.
As a sinner who does his best every day to follow Jesus Christ, it’s time to admit that the Christian community runs rampant with sexism, and that — yes — I am a big part of it. All men are. That’s the nature of societal sin: no one is truly devoid of responsibility, though some are more responsible than others.
I am responsible, and I ashamed. The words of the Psalmist ring in my ears: “Forgive me, O Lord, for I have sinned!”
Shame, I think, is a necessary part of the faith journey. It is good to feel ashamed of our failures and our sins.
Shame is a first step toward positive transformation. It compels us to do better and to move forward.
This is the reality of our human condition. This is the truth that approaches authentic reconciliation between God and the human race and between each and every person.
Shame isn’t a matter of discrediting one’s self-worth, but of penetrating, to its fullest depth, our heart and to take charge of the mystery of suffering and pain that has tied humanity down since the dawn of creation and each of us since the moment of our conception.
“Rend your hearts, not your garments!” It’s time for me and for the Christian community to reject artificial penance and to open our broken and confused hearts to authentic conversion and to see what it is inside of us that constantly allows us to debase and devalue women.
This is God’s invitation, juxtaposed against so many injuries that wound us and that we use to wound others and the innumerable ways we are tempted to harden our hearts and to give up.
St. John Chrystodom is right: “No act of virtue can be large if it does not also benefit another. Therefore, no matter how you spend the day fasting, no matter how you may sleep on a hard floor, and how you may eat ashes and sigh continuously, if do not do good to others, you do not accomplish anything great.”
My journey towards an authentic Christian feminism isn’t novel. In fact, it’s a rediscovery of the faith as it was in the beginning. Jesus Christ himself was the faith’s first feminist. The great heroes of this holy season are the strong and courageous women who stayed with Jesus through his final hours, while most of his male disciples ran away in fear.
After Jesus’ death, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb to remove his body. On the way there, she encountered a gardener. The gardener revealed himself to be the risen Christ. Jesus told her to tell his disciples what happened. As Mary ran towards the men, she held within her the very reason of the church: to share God’s saving love in Jesus. In that moment, in fact, she was the church.
As it was in the beginning, so it should be now. The details of how this abstention from sexism happens will play out in the minutiae of my daily life, but in taking up the challenge, I’m convinced that I will find new life and eventual freedom from this disease of sexism that is a total affront to my faith.
“What are you giving up for Lent?” It’s a question a lot of people will get these next few days. If you want to change your body, perhaps alcohol and candy is the way to go. But if you want to change your heart, a harder fast is needed. This narrow road is gritty, but it isn’t sterile. It will make room in ourselves and our world to experience a love that can make us whole and set us free.", religion

Explicitly Christian signs have featured prominently in the recent protests against President Donald Trump’s immigrant and refugee ban: “Love thy neighbor,” “Jesus was a refugee,” “You call yourselves Christians?”
I sympathize deeply with the protesters’ cause. But it is a mistake to act as if Christianity provides definitive ethical guidance. It’s true that the clarity of righteousness can inspire confidence and solidarity — we are Christians; the bad people are not. The sign holders seek to provide that clarity, and are convinced their message will remind other faithful to follow the agreed upon path. Unfortunately, it will not. In truth, there is no such path, because there is no such thing as Christianity.
It’s not that Christians aren’t united by their faith in Christ. But the practical implications of that faith vary dramatically. When it comes to ethics there are, in fact, many Christianities, each of which is as much a product of historical, cultural and political circumstances as it is of God’s eternal word. As a result, it can be “Christian” to build a wall or to fight a war or protest either, depending on how circumstances have come to define your interpretation of the Scripture.
Before the election, for instance, Pope Francis repeatedly denounced the building of walls as un-Christian. “Dear brothers and sisters — all walls fall,” he cautioned in November, echoing his blunt statement about wall building from February 2016: “This is not the gospel.” Yet on the morning of Trump’s inauguration, in stark contrast to the Pope, Pastor Robert Jeffress praised the building of walls as sanctioned by the Bible. “[The] first step of rebuilding the nation was the building of a great wall,” Jeffress said, referring to the prophet Nehemiah’s work building a wall around Jerusalem. “You see, God is not against building walls!”
Where I teach, in Harrisonburg, Va., there is a large Mennonite population. They, like Quakers and other pacifist Christians, take Jesus’s teachings to mean that Christians should never participate in war. Some refuse to pay taxes that might support the military. Needless to say, there is ample material in the Bible to back up their arguments.
Nevertheless, their perspective is a minority one. Despite widespread understanding of Christ as a radical pacifist — “turn the other cheek” — the vast majority of Christians still believe in justified violence. Many Catholic theologians have vindicated the Crusades as bellum sacrum (holy war), and thus a legitimate response to Muslim violence against Christians. Similar rationale justifies Christian participation in war today, and there’s no better example of it than a 2014 speech by Trump’s adviser, Stephen Bannon, delivered to a conference hosted in the Vatican. “We’re at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict,” Bannon warned, telling his audience that “the people in the church” must “bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant.”
Violence and walls aren’t the only issues that divide the faithful. Christian leaders and laity have been split by every fundamental ethical question: abortion, torture, divorce, the rights of both slaves and the LGBTQ community, women’s suffrage. And of course, the same is true of every religion: just as there are Christianities, not Christianity, so too there are Buddhisms, Judaisms, Hinduisms and Islams, and the inexorable march of history will produce countless others.
Religious texts and teachers are not self-interpreting. Fallible humans must make sense of them, using virtues that transcend religiosity: rationality, empathy, courage and humility.
Implying that authentic religiosity, Christian or otherwise, is defined by the incapacity to do evil is precisely what leads to tribalism and religious bigotry. Instead, fight such bigotry by recognizing that righteous faith has never guaranteed righteous action. Seek out political allies based on ethics, not theology. And understand that the best, most inclusive reason to admit refugees is not because it is Christian, but because it is good.", religion

WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes — and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation’s largest e-commerce business.
Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country’s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its “Delivery Boy.”
The president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos.
By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon’s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target.

The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases.

Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that “the president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.”
Still, Mr. Trump’s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.
His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.
The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network’s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.
“The general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,” Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president’s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.
Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.
Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.
Brad Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump’s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: “Do not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm…”

And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites — some of which Mr. Trump is known to read — have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: “BEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.”
The Post declined to comment.
One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.
People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.
In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.
The president’s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump’s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon’s growing power in the marketplace.
“The Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company’s C.E.O.,” Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.
There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. “This is the guy who said that not paying taxes ‘makes me smart,’” said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.
How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.

If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.
“It would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.
But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.
AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department’s decision to block the companies’ $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.
Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom’s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.
Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company’s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.
The size of company’s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.
In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.
But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump’s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.

President Trump’s hawkish choice for national security adviser doesn’t need the Senate’s approval. That may be lucky for him. The last time senators reviewed his record, many didn’t like what they saw.
WASHINGTON — The last time — perhaps the only time — John R. Bolton inspired bipartisan agreement, it was over the shared conclusion that he was perhaps the least diplomatic personality a president could have ever picked to be an American diplomat.
That was in 2005, when Mr. Bolton was last considered for a government job. Accounts of his red-faced tirades against intelligence analysts whose findings he disagreed with so concerned members of the Senate that they refused to approve his nomination as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.
He wound up getting the job anyway through a recess appointment by Mr. Bush, who later regretted spending the political capital on such a divisive figure, telling conservatives, “I don’t consider Bolton credible.”
Thirteen years later, another president has given Mr. Bolton the far more consequential job of national security adviser. But because that post does not require Senate confirmation, the five months in 2005 that the Senate took to decide whether Mr. Bolton should go to the United Nations remain the only extensive examination of his record and his temperament.
Advertisement
Those who opposed him then, like Carl W. Ford Jr., along with many who supported him, say Mr. Bolton has not changed.

In an appearance before a Senate committee vetting Mr. Bolton’s nomination in 2005, Mr. Ford, a former assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research in the Bush administration, summed up Mr. Bolton, then an under secretary of state for arms control and international security, as a “kiss-up, kick-down sort of guy.”
“I believed then, as I believe now, he lacks any of the qualities to be a senior government official,” Mr. Ford said last week. “It has been my experience that his mouth is much bigger than his brain.”
John R. Bolton, President Trump’s choice for national security adviser, was portrayed during a 2005 Senate confirmation hearing as a threat to U.S. interests.
The confirmation battle took place during the first years of the Iraq war, a conflict Mr. Bolton supported and defends to this day. In the run-up to the war, he was a key proponent of the administration’s argument for the invasion: that the president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, possessed weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States.
“We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities in Iraq,” Mr. Bolton said in 2002. The claim was later shown to be false and based on flawed or selective intelligence.
Amid the emotions that the war by then engendered, consideration of Mr. Bolton’s nomination turned into a five-month standoff as Senate Democrats scrutinized what they saw as Mr. Bolton’s efforts to subvert the government’s own findings in pursuit of his and his allies’ beliefs.
The release of thousands of pages of documents revealed Mr. Bolton, an ally of Vice President Dick Cheney, to be a volatile, aggressive infighter, who seemed willing to cherry-pick intelligence, steamroll analysts he did not agree with and end-run his State Department bosses in pursuit of an agenda considered bellicose even among Bush administration hawks. He shared that penchant with Mr. Cheney, who repeatedly confronted intelligence professionals and agencies whose analytical assessments did not support his conclusions in favor of the Iraq war.
“A lot of officials in Washington behave badly, so that, sadly enough, was unlikely to be disqualifying,” said Antony J. Blinken, the committee’s Democratic staff director. But in examining reasons for Mr. Bolton’s behavior, “That’s when threads started emerging, and when we pulled on them, we started to find things that were truly disturbing, including to Republican members of the committee.”
Advertisement
But not all Republicans, according to Dan Diller, who was deputy staff director for the committee majority.
“There was some validity” to accusations of Mr. Bolton’s behavior during the investigation, Mr. Diller wrote in an email, but it “found no clear ethical transgressions. He was an aggressive, sharp-elbowed bureaucratic operator who always tried to get his way, but would relent in the end rather than engaging in insubordination.”
When Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Bolton for the United Nations job in March 2005, Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, praised him as a “tough-minded diplomat” with a successful track record as an under secretary for arms control and an assistant secretary of state for international organizations.
It later emerged that Ms. Rice and other top diplomats were keen to ship Mr. Bolton off to New York, comfortably away from his portfolio at the State Department. Ms. Rice, now teaching at Stanford, declined to comment for this article.
At the opening of Mr. Bolton’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about a month after he was nominated, the committee chairman, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a Republican, tried for a balanced assessment.
“Opponents of Mr. Bolton have criticized some statements of the nominee as abrasive, confrontational and insensitive,” Mr. Lugar said. “Some of these same statements have been celebrated by supporters of the nominee as demonstrating a tough-minded, refreshingly blunt approach to diplomacy.”
Testifying before the committee, Mr. Bolton presented himself as a reformer who would go to the United Nations and help “build institutions that serve as the cornerstone of freedom in nascent democracies,” curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons and support a global war on terror promised by the Bush administration.
He also sought to explain his comment — famous even by then — that if the top 10 stories of the 38-story United Nations Secretariat building were lopped off, “it wouldn’t make a bit of difference” by asserting that it “was a way of saying there’s not a bureaucracy in the world that can’t be made leaner and more efficient.”

Mr. Bolton’s public statements, it turned out, were the least of his problems.
Over seven hours on that first day, Democrats explored allegations by intelligence officials that Mr. Bolton had gone after two analysts who disagreed with his views on Cuba’s biological weapons capability.
Mr. Bolton was preparing for a speech in which he would accuse a range of nations, including Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Syria, of possessing chemical and biological weapons when he sought clearance from the intelligence officials for an assertion he wanted to make that Cuba was developing a biological weapons program, a claim that was not, in fact, fully supported by American intelligence.
Christian Westermann, a State Department intelligence analyst specializing in biological and chemical weapons, and an unnamed national intelligence official responsible for Latin America disagreed with the claims about Cuba that Mr. Bolton sought to make.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, told the committee that “trying to remove someone as an analyst from their job because you disagree with what they’re saying, I think, is dreadfully wrong.”
Mr. Bolton responded that he had targeted the two officers for reassignment, not for firing, because “If I may say so, their conduct was unprofessional and broke my confidence and trust.”
The next day, Mr. Ford, who had run the bureau where Mr. Westermann worked, rattled the committee by describing Mr. Bolton as a “serial abuser” of lower-level staffers.

“There are a lot of screamers that work in government,” Mr. Ford said. “But you don’t pull somebody so low down the bureaucracy that they are completely defenseless. It’s an 800-pound gorilla devouring a banana.”
Reflecting on the hearing in an interview this week, Mr. Dodd called Mr. Ford’s testimony “a galvanizing moment.”
During the week after Mr. Ford’s appearance, more testimony emerged about Mr. Bolton’s efforts to tailor, suppress or selectively use intelligence as well as intimidate intelligence analysts and other professionals who disagreed with the views held by him or Mr. Cheney and his allies.

Rexon Ryu, a former State Department official, told the panel he encountered Mr. Bolton’s ire after he neglected to forward a cable related to United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq. Mr. Bolton then tried to block Mr. Ryu’s appointment as a liaison on nonproliferation issues. Mr. Ryu was transferred elsewhere at the State Department, and then recently joined the staff of Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a committee Republican.
The unnamed national intelligence officer for Latin America was revealed to be Fulton Armstrong, who in an interview last week said that Mr. Bolton had targeted him for “vicious attacks,” “rumor campaigns” and “infantile” character assassination.
It also emerged that Mr. Bolton had prevented Ms. Rice and her predecessor, Colin Powell, from seeing some State Department findings crucial to drafting policy on Iran, and had kept Ms. Rice out of the loop as he worked to replace Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, seen by Mr. Bolton and his administration faction as too soft on Iran.
There was more.
The panel also learned that Mr. Bolton had bullied intelligence analysts who made more conservative assessments of Syria’s illicit weapons programs in the run-up to a 2003 speech and had requested classified intercepts from the National Security Agency, including the names of American companies and officials, raising concerns that he was seeking information about ideological opponents.
At an emotional committee meeting barely more than a week after the first hearing, two Democrats — Mr. Dodd and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware — demanded three additional weeks to investigate the charges against Mr. Bolton and seek documents from the White House.
Mr. Lugar accused Democrats of stalling and pushed for the committee to vote. But visibly shaken, Senator George Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, said he had heard enough to understand that Mr. Bolton was an ideologue who “fosters an atmosphere of intimidation.” Anyone who behaves in such a way, he concluded, should not be “the face of the United States to the world.”
On May 12, 2005, with Mr. Voinovich still unconvinced, the committee lacked the support to recommend Mr. Bolton’s nomination to the full Senate. Instead, they voted along party lines to forward the nomination for a Senate vote “without recommendation,” a relatively rare move.
Mr. Bolton’s fate was sealed.
Twice, Republicans failed to garner enough votes to break a Democratic filibuster and proceed to a full vote. Before the second attempt, the White House offered to release information related to Mr. Bolton’s Syria speech, but not the list of names from National Security Agency intercepts that Mr. Bolton had sought. Democrats rejected the offer, and in August, Mr. Bush ended up making Mr. Bolton an ambassador in a recess appointment, denouncing what he said were “partisan delaying tactics.”

Control of Congress returned to the Democrats the next year, virtually guaranteeing that Mr. Bolton’s time at the United Nations would be short. He left in late 2006. By that time, Mr. Voinovich, who died in 2016, had changed his view of Mr. Bolton.
“While Bolton is not perfect,” he wrote, “he has demonstrated his ability, especially in recent months, to work with others and follow the president’s lead by working multilaterally.”
Mr. Hagel, who voted in support of Mr. Bolton in 2005 and later became secretary of defense in the Obama administration, also changed his assessment.
“The president and America needs a wise, steady and thoughtful national security advisor,” Mr. Hagel wrote in an email last week. “John Bolton is not that person.”

Christian Westermann, a State Department intelligence analyst specializing in biological and chemical weapons, and an unnamed national intelligence official responsible for Latin America disagreed with the claims about Cuba that Mr. Bolton sought to make.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, told the committee that “trying to remove someone as an analyst from their job because you disagree with what they’re saying, I think, is dreadfully wrong.”
Mr. Bolton responded that he had targeted the two officers for reassignment, not for firing, because “If I may say so, their conduct was unprofessional and broke my confidence and trust.”
The next day, Mr. Ford, who had run the bureau where Mr. Westermann worked, rattled the committee by describing Mr. Bolton as a “serial abuser” of lower-level staffers.

“There are a lot of screamers that work in government,” Mr. Ford said. “But you don’t pull somebody so low down the bureaucracy that they are completely defenseless. It’s an 800-pound gorilla devouring a banana.”
Reflecting on the hearing in an interview this week, Mr. Dodd called Mr. Ford’s testimony “a galvanizing moment.”
During the week after Mr. Ford’s appearance, more testimony emerged about Mr. Bolton’s efforts to tailor, suppress or selectively use intelligence as well as intimidate intelligence analysts and other professionals who disagreed with the views held by him or Mr. Cheney and his allies.

Rexon Ryu, a former State Department official, told the panel he encountered Mr. Bolton’s ire after he neglected to forward a cable related to United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq. Mr. Bolton then tried to block Mr. Ryu’s appointment as a liaison on nonproliferation issues. Mr. Ryu was transferred elsewhere at the State Department, and then recently joined the staff of Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a committee Republican.
The unnamed national intelligence officer for Latin America was revealed to be Fulton Armstrong, who in an interview last week said that Mr. Bolton had targeted him for “vicious attacks,” “rumor campaigns” and “infantile” character assassination.
It also emerged that Mr. Bolton had prevented Ms. Rice and her predecessor, Colin Powell, from seeing some State Department findings crucial to drafting policy on Iran, and had kept Ms. Rice out of the loop as he worked to replace Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, seen by Mr. Bolton and his administration faction as too soft on Iran.
There was more.
The panel also learned that Mr. Bolton had bullied intelligence analysts who made more conservative assessments of Syria’s illicit weapons programs in the run-up to a 2003 speech and had requested classified intercepts from the National Security Agency, including the names of American companies and officials, raising concerns that he was seeking information about ideological opponents.
At an emotional committee meeting barely more than a week after the first hearing, two Democrats — Mr. Dodd and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware — demanded three additional weeks to investigate the charges against Mr. Bolton and seek documents from the White House.
Mr. Lugar accused Democrats of stalling and pushed for the committee to vote. But visibly shaken, Senator George Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, said he had heard enough to understand that Mr. Bolton was an ideologue who “fosters an atmosphere of intimidation.” Anyone who behaves in such a way, he concluded, should not be “the face of the United States to the world.”
On May 12, 2005, with Mr. Voinovich still unconvinced, the committee lacked the support to recommend Mr. Bolton’s nomination to the full Senate. Instead, they voted along party lines to forward the nomination for a Senate vote “without recommendation,” a relatively rare move.
Mr. Bolton’s fate was sealed.
Twice, Republicans failed to garner enough votes to break a Democratic filibuster and proceed to a full vote. Before the second attempt, the White House offered to release information related to Mr. Bolton’s Syria speech, but not the list of names from National Security Agency intercepts that Mr. Bolton had sought. Democrats rejected the offer, and in August, Mr. Bush ended up making Mr. Bolton an ambassador in a recess appointment, denouncing what he said were “partisan delaying tactics.”

Control of Congress returned to the Democrats the next year, virtually guaranteeing that Mr. Bolton’s time at the United Nations would be short. He left in late 2006. By that time, Mr. Voinovich, who died in 2016, had changed his view of Mr. Bolton.
“While Bolton is not perfect,” he wrote, “he has demonstrated his ability, especially in recent months, to work with others and follow the president’s lead by working multilaterally.”
Mr. Hagel, who voted in support of Mr. Bolton in 2005 and later became secretary of defense in the Obama administration, also changed his assessment.
“The president and America needs a wise, steady and thoughtful national security advisor,” Mr. Hagel wrote in an email last week. “John Bolton is not that person.”

President Trump made a personal phone call on Wednesday to a political supporter with a huge megaphone — Roseanne Barr.
Mr. Trump called Ms. Barr to congratulate her on the revival of her comedy, “Roseanne,” and to thank her for her support.
The call was confirmed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.
The president, an obsessive about how TV shows perform, was enthralled by the “huge” ratings “Roseanne” had received, said a person familiar with the call. The show’s first episode, broadcast Tuesday evening on ABC, averaged 18.2 million viewers.
“Roseanne,” featuring a working-class family of five and assorted relatives, returned to the air this week more than two decades after it ended its run. The lead actress’s character plays a backer of Mr. Trump. (Roseanne’s TV sister, Jackie Harris, by contrast, supports Hillary Clinton, though ultimately voted for Jill Stein.)

Ms. Barr herself has been a vocal defender of Mr. Trump.
In an interview with The New York Times published Tuesday, Ms. Barr said that she decided to turn her character, Roseanne Conner, into a Trump supporter because she felt it was an “accurate portrayal” of the political preferences of many working-class Americans.

“I just wanted to have that dialogue about families torn apart by the election and their political differences of opinion and how we handle it,” she said. “I thought that this was an important thing to say at this time.”
Advertisement
Ms. Barr defended the president at several points in the interview, objecting to a suggestion that he opposes many of the views that she and Roseanne Conner have espoused over the years, like support for abortion rights, same-sex marriage and organized labor.
Mr. Trump used to back abortion rights before running for president as a Republican, but he has never supported same-sex marriage.
“I think he voices them quite well,” she said of the stances that the president shares with her — and her character. She insisted that Mr. Trump favored same-sex marriage, even though he has never endorsed its legalization.
“He has said it several times, you know, that he’s not homophobic at all,” she said.
Ms. Barr did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday night.

PEORIA, Ariz. — With allegations of sexual misconduct swirling around President Trump, Debbie Lesko — a Republican candidate for Congress — sat down recently and clicked on “60 Minutes.”
There was Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, saying that she had hidden a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump out of fear for her safety.
Ms. Lesko, an ally of Mr. Trump’s, listened. And after, she said she found Ms. Clifford’s story “a little hard to believe.”
“The business that she’s in — I’m sorry,” Ms. Lesko said. “People can make any kind of allegations they want, that doesn’t mean they’re true.”
Advertisement
Here in Arizona, Ms. Lesko is in the final stretch of a special House race in the state’s deeply conservative Eighth Congressional District, which is being watched as a test of Mr. Trump’s popularity and as a possible foretelling of the fall midterm elections. The seat came open after the incumbent was caught in a sex scandal of his own.

                A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.            
While liberals have expressed outrage at Ms. Clifford’s allegations, many conservatives in this district west of Phoenix say that her statements have done little to change their view of the president, or of candidates like Ms. Lesko who support him.

“I feel bad for Trump,” said Sandi Caskey, 78, a retired General Motors employee who on Tuesday was bowling with church friends.
“I say about her what I say about most of these females,” Ms. Caskey said of Ms. Clifford, and of other women who have come forward with claims of misconduct. “Why now? When all this was going on, why didn’t you take care of it at the time?”
Ms. Clifford told “60 Minutes” that she struck a $130,000 deal for her silence in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. She is now suing Mr. Trump to be released from a nondisclosure agreement she reached with his lawyer.
The Arizona race pits Ms. Lesko, a state legislator for a decade, against Dr. Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room doctor and political newcomer who is among the women driven to run for office after Mr. Trump’s election. Ms. Lesko and Dr. Tipirneni are vying for the seat of Trent Franks, a Republican who left Congress last year after he was accused of offering $5 million to an aide to be a surrogate mother.
The election is the first major race of the Trump presidency in which both candidates are women. Election Day is April 24; early ballots go out this week.
The district’s population is heavily religious and retired, and so conservative that Democrats did not field a candidate in the last two elections. Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist in the state, called it “about the safest Republican seat that you could imagine.”

Still, the Republican National Committee is spending about $280,000 to bolster Ms. Lesko, a sign, Democrats say, of Republican concern.
And after a series of Democratic upsets in recent special elections — first with Doug Jones in Alabama and then with Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania — Dr. Tipirneni believes that she can win. “Our Democratic base is energized,” she said. “There are a lot of reasons that Arizona can be next.”
Dr. Tipirneni, who said she believes Ms. Clifford’s claims, has criticized Mr. Trump, calling him a poor role model.
Over the weekend, in a debate on local television, Ms. Lesko called for an investigation into the claims of sexual misconduct by Mr. Trump, a striking statement from a candidate who had otherwise praised the president. “I’m not the president,” she said, “and I don’t use his rhetoric and I certainly am not going to sexually harass anyone.”
But later, in an interview at her home, she said she had misspoken.
“I didn’t mean a formal investigation by government or something like that,” she said. “I just meant it needs to run its course.”

At the bowling alley, Kathe Wilson, 67, an accountant, said that she had watched Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview and believed much of what Ms. Clifford had said. But she said that it would not sway her from Mr. Trump or Republican candidates.
“Personally,” she said, “I don’t care what he did 12 years ago.”
At a nearby Arby’s, Cheri and Bob McGunagle said they had not even bothered to watch. Because of Ms. Clifford’s work as a pornographic film star, “she has less credibility,” said Mr. McGunagle, 75.
“Her style of life and what she does and how she conducts herself isn’t the Christian way, and we’re Christians,” he said.
Ms. McGunagle, 73, said she thought Ms. Clifford was angling for a spot on a reality television show. “I just hope she’s not on ‘Dancing with the Stars,’” she said, “because they’re going to lose a fan.”

Arizona’s Eighth District is 41 percent Republican and 24 percent Democrat, with 35 percent independent or otherwise affiliated, according to recent numbers from the secretary of state. While Dr. Tipirneni is pushing to become the next big upset, political strategists note that there are differences between this district and Pennsylvania’s 18th, where Mr. Lamb won this month.
Mr. Lamb ran as an anti-Pelosi Democrat with moderate views on abortion, Mr. Coughlin said, “and the candidate out here is not doing any of those things; she’s running a more typical Democratic campaign.”  Pennsylvania, he added, “was a much more blue-collar, working-class district. This is not that.”
But not everyone is sticking by Mr. Trump, or by Republican candidates.
On Tuesday night, at least 200 people came out to a high school to listen to Dr. Tipirneni, who spoke of her support for a public health insurance option, “common-sense” gun control, and robust funding for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
Among those in the crowd were Greg Newman and Robyn Kramer, independents who had come to support Dr. Tipirneni, with their daughter, Ellyana, 9.
“I’m a retired 20-year military veteran Air Force officer; I’ve leaned Republican my whole life,” said Mr. Newman, 49. “And this year I declared to be a Democrat.”
Among the many factors that swayed him, he said, were the allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Trump.
“Beyond reproach,” he said. “It’s appalling to me that anyone could get behind and support someone like that,” he went on. “I look back and I go, ‘is this really why I served?’”

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department’s inspector general, facing increasing political pressure from Republicans in Congress and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said on Wednesday that his office would investigate the surveillance of a former Trump campaign official.
The announcement came amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the White House and Republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.
The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, said he would examine whether law enforcement officials complied with the law and departmental policies in seeking permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap the former campaign adviser, Carter Page. Law enforcement officials had long had concerns that Mr. Page, a former investment banker based in Moscow, was acting as a Russian agent.
Republicans have seized on details about the court-ordered surveillance of Mr. Page as evidence that the Justice Department abused its authority in the Russia investigation. Mr. Horowitz did not name Mr. Page in his announcement.

Mr. Horowitz said he would also review what the Justice Department and the F.B.I. knew at the time about a former British spy and longtime F.B.I. source, Christopher Steele, who provided information about Mr. Page that was included in the surveillance application.

Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision but acknowledged that it fell short of demands by three Republican committee chairmen that the Justice Department appoint a second special counsel to investigate the accusations of surveillance abuses.
“This is not a substitute for a special counsel to investigate this and other matters,” said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, adding that the inspector general’s office “does not have authority to compel witness interviews, including from past employees, so its investigation will be limited in scope in comparison to a special counsel investigation.”
Democrats feared that the investigation would further politicize a Justice Department that seems intent on appeasing President Trump. But they said they were confident that the review would confirm that the department and the F.B.I. had acted properly.
“Any objective review of these claims should tell us what we already know — that the F.B.I. was right, that there was sufficient evidence to continue investigating certain Trump campaign officials for their connections to the Russian government, and that the Republicans are desperate to distract from that investigation,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Horowitz’s office is in the final stages of another high-profile investigation studying several contentious decisions made at the F.B.I. and Justice Department during the 2016 presidential campaign. Findings from one piece of that investigation prompted the firing this month of the former F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe. Mr. Horowitz is expected to release a broader report on his entire review in the coming weeks.
The decision punctuated a year of attacks by Mr. Trump on the Justice Department and the special counsel investigation. Mr. McCabe, who as a former top F.B.I. official is a potential witness in the inquiry, insisted he was fired in an effort to discredit any testimony he might give.
The debate over the surveillance of Mr. Page exploded into public view in January when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee revealed that they had assembled a classified memo accusing law enforcement leaders of abusing their power to spy on Mr. Page.
Advertisement
The document’s chief claim was that the officials repeatedly used unsubstantiated Democratic-funded opposition research from Mr. Steele to obtain the surveillance warrant without adequately explaining to the judge the source of the information.
Mr. Trump declassified the memo over the objections of the F.B.I., which said it had “grave concerns” over its accuracy, a rare public break from the White House. Once it was released, Mr. Trump enthusiastically trumpeted it as evidence that the Russia investigation had been concocted to smear him politically.

Democrats on the committee countered with a memo of their own — one the president declined to declassify — offering a point-by-point refutation of the Republican document and blasting it as an intentionally misleading attempt to undermine the Russia investigation. They said law enforcement officials acted properly in seeking permission to spy on Mr. Page.
Former career prosecutors said that the accusations of surveillance abuse had eroded trust in the Justice Department.
“This is a continuation of a coordinated effort to discredit the special counsel’s work through political attacks on career public servants in the F.B.I.,” said Christopher Hunter, a former F.B.I. agent and federal prosecutor who left the Justice Department last year. “Sow disinformation, discredit the F.B.I. and the Justice Department in the minds of our own American citizens, all to undermine the special counsel and create an environment of confusion and doubt about the legitimacy of the special counsel’s work — that’s what Russian intelligence would do to destabilize our society, yet that’s what’s being done by our own government officials and their collaborators.”
Mr. Sessions has tried to strike a balance between appeasing Mr. Trump and other conservatives assailing the Justice Department without alienating the 113,000 or so people who work under him. After the Republican congressional memo was released, he said that “no department is perfect” and that the Justice Department would address lawmakers’ concerns.
But House Republicans grew frustrated with how the department was handling their concerns over a variety of issues including the surveillance of Mr. Page, the firing of Mr. McCabe and the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.
In a letter last week to the deputy attorney general, Mr. Goodlatte said that the department was moving too slowly and he issued a subpoena last week demanding that officials turn over documents related to those issues.
The Justice Department said in a letter sent Tuesday to Mr. Goodlatte that it would work “to enhance the rate of productions,” and that it would schedule a meeting with the committee and the F.B.I. to discuss how the department would further respond to the request.

Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., said in a news release that he had doubled the number of employees assigned to expedite the request for documents, with a total of 54 people working in shifts from 8 a.m. to midnight.

Trade pacts typically require years of detailed negotiations. The North American Free Trade Agreement needed two years. Creation of the World Trade Organization took eight.
The Trump administration wants to remake global trade in a matter of months.
To secure agreements quickly, the White House has taken a contentious approach to negotiations not seen in decades, threatening allies and adversaries alike with harsh sanctions like tariffs and quotas. Those tactics have returned a few early concessions from trading partners, including South Korea, whose revised trade agreement was formally announced by the United States on Wednesday.
But it remains to be seen how much American workers would benefit from these deals and whether the global trading system can sustain the chaos.
President Trump and his chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, have set a series of crucial deadlines that are rapidly approaching. Temporary exemptions on imports of steel and aluminum from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea have been scheduled to expire on May 1, and the Trump administration has been using that deadline as a cudgel to extract concessions from those nations.

Mr. Trump is demanding that Canada and Mexico, which have been locked in tense, monthslong negotiations with the United States over Nafta, agree to a rewrite of the trade pact in a matter of weeks. He is seeking Europe’s support by then in a trade showdown with China, and has publicly questioned whether the United States will continue to accept a deal made long ago that allows the European Union to charge a tariff on imported cars that is four times as high as the United States’ tariff.
Advertisement
In what might be the most difficult trade fight ahead, the Trump administration is taking steps to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion a year worth of goods from China as soon as late April.
The banana wars were spats that escalated, tariff by tariff, into a decades-long dispute between the United States and the European Union.
Behind the rapid pace is a political promise Mr. Trump made both as a candidate and as president that he would rip up global trade deals that did not work for the United States and rewrite them to favor domestic companies and workers. With the 2018 midterm elections fast approaching and many Republicans in vulnerable positions, Mr. Trump is trying to win agreements that will appeal to his base and help keep Republican control of Congress.
If Mr. Trump’s push works, it could hasten the biggest rewrite of trade rules around the world since 118 nations agreed in Geneva in 1993 to create the World Trade Organization.
But the rush carries significant risks. Hasty deals could do little to solve major, long-running problems for the United States, like China’s financial support for its homegrown companies. New tariffs could also prompt the United States’ biggest trading partners to push back and ignite a trade war or a serious geopolitical confrontation. And it could simply prompt some nations to pull back from the United States, rather than accede to demands that may be unpalatable back home.
“You get this thing rolling and it gets hard to stop,” said Nelson G. Dong, an international investment and technology lawyer in the Seattle office of Dorsey & Whitney, a law firm. “Each side gets its manhood challenged.”
There are legal risks as well. Trade pacts are usually inspected minutely by lawyers on both sides before they are signed. The United States is trying to conclude a rapid-fire series of them at a moment when the office of the United States trade representative is short-staffed for budgetary reasons. Many governments plan to challenge Mr. Trump’s trade actions at the World Trade Organization including Canada, which has already filed a sweeping trade case.
For now, Mr. Trump’s highly ambitious agenda lacks even a clear schedule for trade ministers to meet and sort out the details. The approach has irritated trade ministers in Canada, China, the European Union and Mexico, who have made clear that they would prefer the United States address its chronic trade deficits in a quieter and more collegial manner.

In the case of South Korea, the high-pressure tactic returned results — though it is not yet clear how much Seoul’s concessions will help American workers.
Under the deal announced on Wednesday, South Korea will reduce its steel exports to the United States by nearly one-third to avoid getting hit with new American steel tariffs. South Korea also agreed to double, to 50,000, the number of American cars that it will allow to be imported each year into the country without meeting South Korea’s unique safety standards, which have been criticized for decades by American and European officials as a trade barrier.
South Korean demand for American cars appears to be growing, but the new rules may not provide an immediate increase for Detroit. According to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association, the number of cars imported from the United States remains below the 25,000 cap, reaching 20,019 last year.
Still, the South Korea examples offers a look at what Mr. Trump may be seeking by pressuring trading partners for quick deals. Mr. Trump strongly hinted last week that his goal in confronting trading partners was a negotiated settlement, as opposed collecting billions of dollars from new tariffs.

“I believe that, in many cases — maybe all cases — we’ll end up negotiating a deal,” he said.
It is not clear how well that approach will work with China, a much bigger and more pugnacious trading partner. Chinese officials have repeatedly said that they object to threats but do see room to reduce the country’s trade barriers. Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech this month that China was ready to lower tariffs on imported cars and some other items.
“We will make more efforts on market opening, promote industrial updating and the development of balanced trade, and provide more choices for consumers,” he said.
Comments like that have some analysts predicting that a deal will be reached. “The most likely outcome is that China will concede,” said Larry Hu, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Macquarie Securities.
But significant risks remain of a possible trade war by the end of next month.
“Nafta could get some result by that date and the European Union might have a deal by then, but in the case of China, this will be more difficult,” said He Weiwen, a former Chinese Commerce Ministry official and longtime trade expert. “The Chinese are very mad.”

Already some in the Trump administration are spoiling for a fight over the W.T.O., which arbitrates international trade disputes.
Mr. Lighthizer and many other Democratic and Republican trade experts have repeatedly complained that the W.T.O.’s process for reviewing and solving trade disputes has put the United States and Western countries at a disadvantage.
Critics in the United States complain that the W.T.O. allows China to keep steep trade barriers: triple the average tariffs of the United States and double the average tariffs of the European Union. China’s retort is that the West agreed to the tariffs in the 1990s, and that a deal is a deal, not to be changed unless the West offers further concessions.
Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the W.T.O., said that what the United States accomplishes could depend to a considerable extent on whether it seeks a broad opening up of international trade, including a requirement that China remove many trade barriers, or whether the United States ends up protecting its own market.
“If the United States carpet bombing on trade is about opening a negotiation, which is one of the interpretations, then I think there is ample room to improve the rules of the W.T.O.,” he said.
But he added that if American officials “are after blowing up the multilateral system, then it is a very serious issue.”

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s latest effort at banning transgender individuals from serving in the military amounts to what legal experts said is essentially a reprise of an all-too-familiar directive at the Pentagon: the 1994 “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
A slew of medical and legal professionals have already lined up against the newest White House order, issued late Friday night, which experts said may survive only if it is backed by the Supreme Court.
That order is based on recommendations outlined by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in a Feb. 22 memo on the circumstances under which transgender people would be allowed to join or remain in the military.
The memo by Mr. Mattis disqualified all people “who require or have undergone gender transition.”
Advertisement
But he also recommended that, going forward, “transgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all service members, in their biological sex.” Gender dysphoria is the psychological condition of a person’s discomfort with their biological gender.
Advertisement
The memo said that transgender troops who would be grandfathered into the system — under an Obama administration policy that allowed them to serve — could be discharged from the military if they continue to challenge the recommendations in courts.
Supporters of transgender rights said the recommendations echoed “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which was repealed in 2010 after 17 years of requiring gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military to keep their sexuality a secret.
“What they’ve basically done is said that if you have gender dysphoria, you’re out, with the exception of being grandfathered in, but if that’s used against them in court, you’re definitely out,” said Brad Carson, the former Defense Department acting under secretary for personnel and readiness during the Obama administration.
“They’re also basically saying that if you just keep quiet, we’ll leave you alone,” Mr. Carson said. He suggested that inherent contradiction is where a legal defense of the new policy could fall apart in court.
Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, which focuses on sexuality and the military, said he expects to see more lawsuits filed, including those that will seek to use contradictions within Mr. Mattis’s memo as a basis for complaint.
In a report accompanying the new directive on Friday, the Pentagon said that 8,980 service members who identified as transgender were currently serving, and that 937 of those people had been given a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
Mr. Mattis has since refused to discuss the issue, leaving transgender service members in a state of uncertainty. On Tuesday, he declined to answer questions about the new policy because it is a matter of litigation.

“This is what we do in America,” Mr. Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.
“Anything I say could jeopardize the purity” of the legal case, he said.
Already, President Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military, underway since last summer, have been blocked in court.

There are at the moment at least four court cases challenging Mr. Trump’s original ban, announced in a series of Twitter posts last July. Federal judges have ordered that transgender people continue to be allowed to serve pending the resolution of lawsuits filed against the ban. Transgender recruits have continued to join the military, as well.
In November, the Pentagon approved a gender-reassignment surgery for an active-duty member of the military. That surgery came three months after Mr. Trump tweeted that “the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.”
The president said he decided to issue the ban after consulting with generals and military experts, although Mr. Mattis was given only a day’s notice. Since then, the Defense Department has been scrambling to come up with an explicit policy that adheres to Mr. Trump’s tweet.
In his memo, Mr. Mattis cited “substantial risks” about military personnel who seek to change or who question their gender identity.
He said that allowing some of them to serve would amount to an exemption of certain mental, physical and sex-based standards, and “could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military that is not conducive to military effectiveness and lethality.”
Mr. Mattis’s assertion contradicts a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation, which found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would “have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs” for the Pentagon.
The study estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. It concluded that there were 2,000 to 11,000 active-duty troops who are transgender.

Citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected “little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness” in the United States.
In his recommendation to Mr. Trump, Mr. Mattis said the RAND study “heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness, and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own.”
“In short,” Mr. Mattis concluded, “this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or RAND assumed.”
On Wednesday, two former surgeons general described themselves as “troubled” by Mr. Mattis’s recommendations.
“The Defense Department’s report on transgender military service has mischaracterized the robust body of peer-reviewed research on the effectiveness of transgender medical care as demonstrating ‘considerable scientific uncertainty,’” Dr. M. Joycelyn Elders and Dr. David Satcher wrote in a joint statement.

WASHINGTON — After weeks of uncertainty atop the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Trump dismissed its secretary, David J. Shulkin, on Wednesday and announced he would replace him with the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy.
If confirmed, Dr. Jackson, a career Naval officer who has no real experience running a large bureaucracy, would inherit a set of challenges that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican administrations alike. The department, the federal government’s second largest, has been burdened for years by aging infrastructure, an inefficient health care system and an unwieldy 360,000-person work force.
He could also quickly face crucial, multibillion-dollar decisions over the replacement of its outdated computerized records system and legislation that would ease the rules around veterans seeking private health care at government expense.
The announcement punctuated what has been a rapid fall from favor for Dr. Shulkin, a politically moderate former hospital executive who delivered Mr. Trump a string of bipartisan legislative victories at a time when he was struggling to find them. But in his final weeks, he struggled to fight off attempts by more conservative administration officials to have him removed and was dogged by an unflattering inspector general report on his overseas travel that undermined his relationship with the president.

Dr. Shulkin’s departure was the latest chapter in the remaking of Mr. Trump’s team of senior advisers, a shake-up that has led to the replacement of the secretary of state, the director of the C.I.A. and the national security adviser, along with White House aides.

In the midst of that turmoil, Dr. Jackson, 50, who was named to his current position by President Barack Obama in 2013, has grown close with Mr. Trump, a commander in chief who enjoys familiar faces in his orbit and often rewards them with new roles.
Dr. Jackson had a rare turn in the spotlight in January, when he announced the results of Mr. Trump’s physical, his first while in office, and addressed speculation over the president’s physical and mental health. The president was very pleased with the performance.
“I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” Dr. Jackson said.
His policy views are all but unknown, though, especially on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will decide whether he is up to leading the department. Senators, including Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, issued cautious statements on Wednesday praising Dr. Shulkin and indicating that they would need to get to know the nominee.
That tone was echoed by mainstream veterans groups like Disabled American Veterans and the American Legion, who hold considerable sway in Washington, and who warned of a potential leadership vacuum at the department.
Privately, several White House aides acknowledged that Dr. Jackson’s lack of managerial experience could be problematic and said that once again the president’s interest in his personal bond with someone was more significant than their curriculum vitae.
In a Twitter post on Wednesday announcing the changes, Mr. Trump called Dr. Jackson “highly respected” and thanked Dr. Shulkin for “service to our country and to our great veterans.”

            I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs....        
Mr. Trump said that Robert Wilkie, the under secretary for defense personnel and readiness at the Defense Department, would serve as acting secretary in the meantime, bypassing the department’s deputy secretary, Thomas G. Bowman.

The White House did not respond to a request asking who would replace Dr. Jackson.
Dr. Shulkin, who served as under secretary of veterans affairs in the Obama administration, had begun to make headway on some of the department’s most persistent problems. Those included an expansion of the G.I. Bill for post-9/11 veterans, legislation that makes it easier for the department to remove bad employees and a law that streamlines the appeals process for veterans seeking disability benefits.
Those successes and his easy grasp of complicated policy issues won Dr. Shulkin deep support on Capitol Hill and among veterans groups. And Mr. Trump, who made veterans issues and overhauling the scandal-ridden department a focal point of his campaign, showered Dr. Shulkin with praise. At a bill-signing ceremony in June, the president teased that the secretary need never worry about hearing his “Apprentice”-era catchphrase, “You’re fired.”
“We’ll never have to use those words on our David,” Mr. Trump said. “We will never use those words on you, that’s for sure.”

But in recent months, a group of conservative Trump administration appointees at the White House and the department began to break with the secretary and plot his ouster. At issue was how far and how fast to privatize health care for veterans, a long-sought goal for conservatives like the Koch brothers.
The officials — who included Dr. Shulkin’s press secretary and assistant secretary for communications, along with a top White House domestic policy aide — came to consider Dr. Shulkin and his top deputy as obstacles.
The secretary’s troubles only grew when what had been an internal power struggle burst into the open in February, after the department’s inspector general issued a scathing report on a trip Dr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark. The report, describing what it called “serious derelictions,” found the secretary had spent much of the trip sightseeing and had improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift.

                Since President Trump’s inauguration, staffers of the White House and federal agencies have left in firings and resignations, one after the other.            
Critics of the secretary seized on the report to try to hasten his removal. Dr. Shulkin, fearing a coup, went public with a warning about officials “trying to undermine the department from within” and cut off those he saw as disloyal. The efforts backfired. At the White House, senior officials came to believe that Dr. Shulkin had misled them about the contents of the report. And the secretary’s public declarations only further aggravated top officials, who felt Dr. Shulkin had gone too far in commenting on internal politics with news outlets and had opened the administration to sharp criticism over his trip to Europe, which the report said cost more than $122,000.
But as recently as early March, after meetings with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Dr. Shulkin publicly claimed victory, signaling that he had the White House’s support to remove officials opposing him.

The victory was short-lived. Before long, Dr. Shulkin sharply curtailed his public profile, cutting off communications with reporters and isolating himself from top deputies he viewed as disloyal. People who have spoken with the secretary in recent days said he was determined to keep his post, even as it became increasingly clear his time was up. He was set to meet with leaders from the nation’s largest veterans groups on Thursday.
Despite his problems with the White House, Dr. Shulkin remained overwhelmingly popular on Capitol Hill, where the Senate unanimously confirmed him last year, and among the veterans groups that have traditionally held outsize influence in Washington. In recent weeks, leaders from both parties publicly and privately signaled their support, even as rumors of his replacement appeared in news reports.
But Mr. Trump had had enough. He began to discuss successors in recent weeks, even considering  Energy Secretary Rick Perry as a possibility. He told friends last weekend that he would fire Dr. Shulkin, it was just a question of when.
Dr. Shulkin had made a preliminary inquiry about having Dr. Jackson for an under secretary role last year, and the president spoke with him briefly about it then, one senior administration official said. But it went nowhere at the time.
By Monday, Mr. Trump had started animatedly talking with a handful of people about the idea of Dr. Jackson’s replacing Dr. Shulkin, people familiar with the discussions said. Still, he did not tell many advisers of his plan until soon before it was announced.
A Navy doctor since 1995, Dr. Jackson deployed as an emergency medicine physician to Taqaddum, Iraq, during the Iraq war. He has served as a member of the White House medical unit since 2006 and as its lead physician since 2013, overseeing Mr. Obama’s physicals.
Dr. Jackson had told several people that he planned to retire from Washington after Mr. Obama left office. But Mr. Trump, whose previous personal physician made headlines with a series of unauthorized news interviews about his patient, asked Dr. Jackson to stay on. Mr. Trump, who goes to great lengths to hide details of his personal life, quickly came to trust Dr. Jackson, referring to him warmly as “Doc” around the White House.
Democrats, moderate Republicans and mainline veterans groups have all feared that Dr. Shulkin’s departure could clear the way for a more aggressive push for government-subsidized private care at the department.
“Every major veterans’ organization in this country vigorously opposes the privatization of the V.A.,” Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “I stand with them. Our job is to strengthen the V.A. in order to provide high-quality care to our veterans, not dismember it.”
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the rank of Dr. Ronny L. Jackson. He is a rear admiral, not an admiral.

An American military drone strike over the weekend in southern Libya killed a top recruiter and logistics specialist for Al Qaeda’s branch in northwest Africa, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, and a senior military official warned of more attacks on extremists there.
The military’s Africa Command said in a statement that the attack killed two militants, one of whom was identified as Musa Abu Dawud, a high-ranking official in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM.
Mr. Dawud trained Qaeda recruits in Libya for strike operations in the region, and provided logistics, money and weapons that enabled the group to threaten and attack American and Western interests, the military statement said.
Until now, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya — eight since President Trump took office — almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north. Over several months in 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt to destroy the Islamic State’s stronghold there.

The missile fired by the American drone on Saturday was the first in southern Libya. It struck a house in Ubari, 435 miles south of Tripoli, in the country’s southwest, a notorious haven for a deadly mix of Al Qaeda and other extremist groups that also operate in the Sahel region of Niger, Chad, Mali and Algeria.
Advertisement
The area is also close to major oil fields that were crippled by violent ethnic feuding in 2015.
“I wouldn’t say this is the beginning of a wider campaign,” Col. Mark Cheadle, the Africa Command’s chief spokesman, said in an email. But, he added, “If we find targets we can strike, and it is appropriate to do so, I think we would certainly consider the option.”
Colonel Cheadle said that Mr. Dawud was “a significant ‘fixer’ for Al Qaeda.” Other American military officials said that Mr. Dawud had been under surveillance for a significant period of time but gave no details about how he was tracked to a house and killed with another Qaeda fighter. The command said that no civilians were believed to have been killed in the attack.
The State Department said in 2016 that Mr. Dawud was a “specially designated global terrorist.” He began engaging in terrorist activity as early as 1992, the State Department said at the time.
Pictures in Libyan news outlets showed a mutilated corpse lying in the rubble of a house and a pair of shrapnel-ridden vehicles nearby. Residents were quoted as saying that the house had been frequented by foreigners.

The strike came as the Trump administration has been reassessing the American military commitment in North and West Africa after an ambush in Niger in October that killed four American soldiers. The Pentagon has been preparing to fly armed drone missions from Niger’s capital, Niamey, a step that diplomats and analysts say could further widen the Pentagon’s shadow war in that part of the continent.
The American military is also building a $100 million drone base in Agadez, north of Niamey, that is set to begin operations this year.
In a sign of how the Pentagon has sought to obscure its operations in Libya and other parts of northwestern Africa, the Africa Command initially did not announce the strike. It responded to questions from The New York Times late Saturday with a terse statement after news reports about the strike circulated in Libya.
The command on Wednesday identified Mr. Dawud as the target of the attack and confirmed his death after “operational reporting” and an analysis of the strike’s damage was complete.

Questions about whether the American military, under the Trump administration, is blurring the scope of operations in Africa were raised this month when it was revealed that the U.S. had carried out four airstrikes in Libya from September to January that the Africa Command did not disclose at the time.
The command’s statement, coupled with Colonel Cheadle’s comments, left little doubt that American airstrikes could soon expand in southern Libya.
“Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, such as ISIS, have taken advantage of undergoverned spaces in Libya to establish sanctuaries for plotting, inspiring and directing terror attacks,” the statement said. “Left unaddressed, these organizations could continue to inflict casualties on the civilian populations and security forces, and plot attacks against U.S. citizens and allied interests in the region.”

Nancy McFadden, a lawyer and political adviser who spent years in Washington working in the Clinton administration and later became the most important aide to Gov. Jerry Brown of California, died last Thursday at her home in Sacramento. She was 59.
The cause was ovarian cancer, the governor said in a statement.
In January, Ms. McFadden announced that she would step away from her daily duties in the governor’s office to receive medical treatment. She learned she had ovarian cancer in 2002, while she was working for a previous California governor, Gray Davis.
Ms. McFadden’s title, executive secretary, masked her importance in California. Governor Brown called her “the best chief of staff a governor could ever ask for.”
“She understood government and politics, she could manage, she was a diplomat, and she was fearless,” he said.

Throughout Mr. Brown’s current round as governor — he served from 1975 to 1983 before being elected again in 2010 — Ms. McFadden was a constant at his side. She traveled with him to China and Rome to discuss climate change and negotiated with state legislators to persuade them to back a new gas tax.
Ms. McFadden was seen as the leader of a small group of advisers who work closely with the governor. Last year, she spearheaded a successful effort to extend the state’s extensive cap-and-trade program, setting a statewide limit on greenhouse gas emissions. She regarded the achievement as one of her greatest.
A photograph of her and other members of the governor’s staff on the day the bill was passed hangs at her home, its frame engraved with the inscription “That time we changed the world.”
Ms. McFadden gained her most extensive experience in politics working for Bill Clinton. She joined his 1992 presidential campaign early on at the urging of Warren M. Christopher, a partner at the law firm O’Melveny & Myers in Washington, where she was a junior associate. (Mr. Christopher became secretary of state in President Clinton’s first term.)
Recognizing her interest in public policy, Mr. Christopher urged Ms. McFadden to leave her job and join the fledgling Clinton campaign in Little Rock, Ark., where Mr. Clinton was governor.

Ms. McFadden was ultimately named deputy political director for the campaign and found herself navigating some of its most fraught controversies, including accusations of an extramarital affair and Mr. Clinton’s draft deferments during the Vietnam War.
After the 1992 election, Ms. McFadden was appointed a deputy associate attorney general, acting as a liaison between the Justice Department and the White House. She moved on to become general counsel for the Transportation Department and later continued to serve in the Clinton administration as the deputy chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore.

In 2001, after George W. Bush defeated Mr. Gore in the 2000 presidential race, Ms. McFadden returned to California, where she had spent much of her childhood, to advise Governor Davis during the state’s energy crisis.
She later worked at Pacific Gas & Electric Corporation as senior vice president for public affairs before she joined the Brown administration.
Though Ms. McFadden had not worked with Governor Brown before joining his staff, the two developed a rapport that went far beyond anything he had with other staff members.
“She completely won over his trust,” said Anne Gust Brown, the governor’s wife, who is also one of his top advisers.
Nancy Elizabeth McFadden was born in Wilmington, Del., the eldest child of William McFadden and the former Mary Adams. Both parents were registered nurses. The couple divorced when Nancy was a child, and at 10 she moved to San Jose, Calif., with her mother and younger brother. As a nurse her mother would work extra shifts at night to make ends meet.
Ms. McFadden attended San Jose State University and ran for student body president, beating out Joe Trippi, who would become a prominent Democratic political consultant.
After getting her bachelor’s degree she graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law and clerked for a federal judge.
Ms. McFadden was known for her discretion, choosing to remain behind the scenes despite her prominence in the administration.

“She knew how politics worked and could make it function without needing to be in the spotlight,” a friend, Steven Maviglio, said. “She was willing to do months and months of work, without worrying about who was going to get credit. She understood it was not about her.”

Walmart customers looking to toss the latest issue of Cosmopolitan magazine into their shopping carts will have to search the superstore a little harder.
The retailer has decided to remove the magazine from its checkout aisle displays in its 5,000-plus stores in the United States, in a move announced by a nonprofit anti-pornography group that connected the company’s decision to the #MeToo movement.
The magazines will be placed on racks elsewhere, varying by store. The April issue features Cardi B, the reality star turned rapper, who gives an “uncensored and totally amazing” interview inside. Other headlines promise tips on sex toys and foreplay, the secrets of super-close couples and this teaser: “Could you be guilty of micro-cheating? Could he?”
Walmart, in a statement, acknowledged that “the concerns raised were heard” but said that its decision stemmed from business reasons.

“As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes,” the statement said. When asked for further comment, Walmart indicated that there are a number of factors it evaluates when making in-store placement decisions, including customer feedback and sales data.

Nevertheless, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an advocacy group that has campaigned against what it calls Cosmopolitan’s “hyper-sexualized and sexually objectifying” content, took some credit for the move on Tuesday, citing its “collaborative dialogue” with Walmart.
“This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture,” said Dawn Hawkins, the group’s executive director, in a statement.
A Cosmopolitan spokesman declined to directly address the group’s description but emphasized the publication’s focus on female empowerment.
“We are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues,” he said in a statement.
The magazine, which will still be available for purchase on periodical racks on Walmart stores, has been a focus of the nonprofit group for years. In 2015, the organization started a campaign to get stores to shield Cosmopolitan’s headlines and covers behind blinders or wraps similar to those that frequently cover pornographic material.
At that time, it worked with Victoria Hearst, the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, who founded Cosmopolitan’s publisher, the Hearst Group. The joint effort appeared to be successful.
Ms. Hearst, who now runs a “Cosmo Hurts Kids” campaign aimed at stopping the sale of the magazine to children under 18, was not involved in the center’s current push, according to according to Haley Halverson, the organization’s vice president for advocacy and outreach.

The group, which was founded in 1962 and was previously known as Morality in Media, has continued to focus on Cosmopolitan in part, Ms. Halverson said, because the magazine was “targeting young girls” with its messaging.
Advertisement
“A young teenager who first picks up Cosmo is going to be attracted to the bubble gum pink cover and to stories about Selena Gomez and One Direction,” Ms. Halverson said. “But within the covers, Cosmo is filled with extremely explicit articles that detail things like sexting, pornography, group sex, public sex and other forms of risky sex that actually a lot of young girls today are being pressured to do before they’re ready.”
Ms. Halverson also said the group viewed its efforts as especially important in the midst of the continuing conversation around sexual harassment that was sparked by the #MeToo movement.
“Cosmopolitan really likes to wrap itself up in its faux feminist mystique where they’re claiming that because they’re talking about sex, it’s liberating to women,” she said. “But it’s time to raise the level of discourse and say, ‘Well, are they talking about sex in an actually empowering or productive way?’”
When asked, Ms. Halverson could not think of an example of a publication or media organization discussing sexuality in the manner she described.
The statement linking Cosmopolitan to #MeToo culture was met with some skepticism online. The magazine has written multiple articles about the #MeToo movement, as well as the sexual assault and consent issues at its center.
In an article for Vogue, Michelle Ruiz, a former sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan, wrote that the publication has long advocated for consensual adult sex and has recently shifted its focus to women’s sexual pleasure.

            Walmart using #MeToo as an excuse to stop selling Cosmopolitan in checkout lines is pretty ridiculous. Censoring frank information about sex feeds into rape culture by denying girls knowledge about their sexuality and choices they can make for themselves.https://t.co/gyPllZ7QFV pic.twitter.com/YiwQQF0Vd7 

            The grossest thing is how these folks are blatantly distorting what the #MeToo movement is about to justify pushing Cosmo off of Walmart checkout shelves. https://t.co/YRn8mEBNWH 

            a conservative religious group cites #MeToo for why Cosmo should be removed from shelves. keep that phrase out of your mouth + focus on teaching men to act right, not blaming women who express their sexuality in the mildest, most hetero of ways. https://t.co/iLlyGLWV8L 
John Harrington, a publishing industry consultant who until 2015 published a newsletter covering the magazine business, linked Walmart’s decision to larger trends. As magazine sales continue to decline, Mr. Harrington said, it was likely that Cosmopolitan’s sales at Walmart were following that trend.
But he also said that the retailer historically had appeared more responsive than other retailers to pressure from outside groups.
In the past, “they have occasionally moved magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour on an issue-by-issue basis,” Mr. Harrington said.

In 2003, Walmart announced plans to obscure the covers of those two publications, as well as Redbook and Marie Claire. That same year, its stores also stopped selling the men’s magazines Maxim, Stuff and FHM after pressure from Christian groups.

At least for a night, America said it really did want more “Roseanne.”
The revival of the vintage ABC sitcom got off to an enormously strong start on Tuesday night, drawing 18.2 million viewers and a 5.1 rating among adults under 50, according to Nielsen. The “Roseanne” numbers rank as the highest total of any comedy on the broadcast networks since the 2014 season premiere of “The Big Bang Theory.”
For comparison’s sake, NBC’s reboot of “Will & Grace” in September drew a little over 10 million viewers and a 3.0 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds. Earlier this month, ABC’s revival of “American Idol” reached an audience of 10.3 million viewers and scored a 2.3 rating in the prize demographic. Both debuts were cause for celebration at both broadcast networks.
The “Roseanne” numbers, however, are in an entirely different category and stand to grow when delayed viewing is factored in.
Many TV industry executives were divided on whether or not a new version of “Roseanne” would take off. Though the industry has been in a reboot craze for the last two years (series like “Full House,” “Twin Peaks,” “The X-Files,” “One Day at a Time” and “Murphy Brown,” have all been brought back to life), the results have ranged from “meh” to solid.
Unlike those shows, “Roseanne” has seemingly appealed to viewers for reasons having nothing to do with nostalgia: In interviews leading up to the sitcom’s premiere, the show’s Emmy-winning star, Roseanne Barr, made it clear that she was a supporter of President Trump and let it be known that her program would grapple with a hot political moment that has divided some American families.
“I’ve always had it be a true reflection of the society we live in,” Ms. Barr said during a Television Critics Association press event in January. “Half the country voted for him, half of them didn’t. It’s just realistic.”
If “Roseanne” does not suffer an enormous decline, the series has a good chance at becoming one of the top-rated shows of the 2017-18 television season. The highest-rated series among adults under 50 is currently “This Is Us,” which has a 5.3 rating among adults under 50, but that includes delayed-viewing data.
ABC ran two episodes of “Roseanne” on Tuesday night. In the first half-hour, shown at 8 p.m. Eastern time, the show had an average of 17.7 million viewers. That number grew at 8:30 to 18.6 million viewers. The network will air nine episodes altogether.
The network has not made a decision about whether there will be another season, but Ms. Barr told The New York Times, “We all want to keep doing it so we just hope people like it and they watch it, and it gets renewed, you know, we all want that.”
The “Roseanne” revival has been part of a broader strategy at ABC to reorient its programming since Mr. Trump won the November 2016 election. That has included inspiring and hopeful shows, among them “The Good Doctor,” a surprise ABC hit, about an autistic doctor that stars Freddie Highmore. And it included the reboot of “Roseanne.”
The first run of “Roseanne” lasted nine seasons, from 1988 to 1997. At the time it was one of the few hit programs centered on a working-class family. The show impressed critics, provided grist for op-ed columnists and won its share of Emmys and Golden Globes, and a Peabody.
The sitcom could also help ABC finally escape the basement among the big four networks. It has finished each of the last two seasons in last place.

WASHINGTON — A lawyer for President Trump broached the idea of Mr. Trump’s pardoning two of his former top advisers, Michael T. Flynn and Paul Manafort, with their lawyers last year, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The discussions came as the special counsel was building cases against both men, and they raise questions about whether the lawyer, John Dowd, who resigned last week, was offering pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation.
The talks suggest that Mr. Trump’s lawyers were concerned about what Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort might reveal were they to cut a deal with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in exchange for leniency. Mr. Mueller’s team could investigate the prospect that Mr. Dowd made pardon offers to thwart the inquiry, although legal experts are divided about whether such offers might constitute obstruction of justice.
Mr. Dowd’s conversation with Mr. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, occurred sometime after Mr. Dowd took over last summer as the president’s personal lawyer, at a time when a grand jury was hearing evidence against Mr. Flynn on a range of potential crimes. Mr. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, agreed in late November to cooperate with the special counsel’s investigation. He pleaded guilty in December to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and received favorable sentencing terms.
Advertisement
Mr. Dowd has said privately that he did not know why Mr. Flynn had accepted a plea, according to one of the people. He said he had told Mr. Kelner that the president had long believed that the case against Mr. Flynn was flimsy and was prepared to pardon him, the person said.
Advertisement
The pardon discussion with Mr. Manafort’s attorney, Reginald J. Brown, came before his client was indicted in October on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes. Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, has pleaded not guilty and has told others he is not interested in a pardon because he believes he has done nothing wrong and the government overstepped its authority. Mr. Brown is no longer his lawyer.
It is unclear whether Mr. Dowd discussed the pardons with Mr. Trump before bringing them up with the other lawyers.
Mr. Dowd, who was hired last year to defend the president during the Mueller inquiry, took the lead in dealing directly with Mr. Flynn’s and Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, according to two people familiar with how the legal team operated.
He denied on Wednesday that he discussed pardons with lawyers for the president’s former advisers.
“There were no discussions. Period,” Mr. Dowd said. “As far as I know, no discussions.”
Contacted repeatedly over several weeks, the president’s lawyers representing him in the special counsel’s investigation maintained that they knew of no discussions of possible pardons.

“Never during the course of my representation of the president have I had any discussions of pardons of any individual involved in this inquiry,” Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said on Wednesday.
Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with the investigation, added, “I have only been asked about pardons by the press and have routinely responded on the record that no pardons are under discussion or under consideration at the White House.”

Mr. Kelner and Mr. Brown declined to comment.
During interviews with Mr. Mueller’s investigators in recent months, current and former administration officials have recounted conversations they had with the president about potential pardons for former aides under investigation by the special counsel, according to two people briefed on the interviews.
In one meeting with lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office last year, Mr. Trump asked about the extent of his pardon power, according to a person briefed on the conversation. The lawyers explained that the president’s powers were broad, the person said. And in other meetings with senior advisers, the president raised the prospect of pardoning Mr. Flynn, according to two people present.
Legal experts are divided about whether a pardon offer, even if given in exchange for continued loyalty, can be considered obstruction of justice. Presidents have constitutional authority to pardon people who face or were convicted of federal charges.
But even if a pardon were ultimately aimed at hindering an investigation, it might still pass legal muster, said Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and a professor at Harvard Law School.
“There are few powers in the Constitution as absolute as the pardon power — it is exclusively the president’s and cannot be burdened by the courts or the legislature,” he said. “It would be very difficult to look at the president’s motives in issuing a pardon to make an obstruction case.”
The remedy for such interference would more likely be found in elections or impeachment than in prosecuting the president, Mr. Goldsmith added.
But pardon power is not unlimited, said Samuel W. Buell, a professor of law at Duke University.
“The framers did not create the power to pardon as a way for the president to protect himself and his associates” from being prosecuted for their own criminal behavior, he said.
Under Mr. Buell’s interpretation, Mr. Dowd’s efforts could be used against the president in an obstruction case if prosecutors want to demonstrate that it was part of larger conspiracy to impede the special counsel investigation.

Mr. Dowd is said to believe that the president has nearly unlimited pardon authority, but he and others have repeatedly insisted that no pardon offers have been made.
In July, amid reports that Mr. Trump was considering granting pardons to his associates under investigation, Mr. Dowd told BuzzFeed that “there is nothing going on on pardons, research — nothing.”
And about two weeks after Mr. Flynn’s guilty plea, Mr. Trump said that such talk was premature.
“I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Dec. 15 on the South Lawn of the White House. “We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the F.B.I. and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.”
Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with the investigation into Mr. Flynn since at least early last year. In February 2017, alone in the Oval Office with the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, the president asked him to end the investigation, Mr. Comey told lawmakers. After that episode became public, Mr. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department to be the special counsel.
On the day after Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty, the president wrote in a Twitter post said to be composed by Mr. Dowd that he fired Mr. Flynn for, among other things, lying to the F.B.I. But Mr. Trump continued to publicly defend his former national security adviser, saying two days later that he felt “very badly” for Mr. Flynn and that the F.B.I. had “destroyed his life.”
It is not clear what Mr. Flynn has told the special counsel as part of his cooperation agreement. During interviews with other witnesses, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have focused on what Mr. Flynn told the president about his calls during the transition with the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak. The calls came soon after the Obama administration announced new sanctions on Russia for its role in disrupting the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mr. Manafort, who ran Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign for several months, has been indicted on dozens of counts of money laundering and other financial crimes connected to his work as a lobbyist and former consultant for Viktor F. Yanukovych, who at the time was president of Ukraine. The charges are not connected to any work that Mr. Manafort did for Mr. Trump.
Rick Gates, who was Mr. Manafort’s business partner for years and also served as deputy chairman of the Trump presidential campaign, pleaded guilty last month as part of a cooperation agreement with Mr. Mueller’s team. On the day the plea agreement was announced, Mr. Manafort vowed to continue to fight the charges against him.
Advertisement
In total, 19 people have been charged with crimes by Mr. Mueller. Five of them, including Mr. Flynn and two other Trump associates, have pleaded guilty and have agreed to cooperate.
In August, Mr. Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff from Arizona who had been found guilty of federal criminal contempt for refusing to stop targeting Latinos in traffic stops and other law enforcement efforts. The pardon prompted an outcry because Mr. Arpaio, whose crackdown on illegal immigration made him a national symbol for both conservatives and liberals, had supported Mr. Trump’s run for president.
Mr. Trump’s only other pardon came this month, for a sailor who had pleaded guilty to unlawfully retaining national defense information and obstruction of justice after he took cellphone photos on a nuclear submarine and then destroyed the photos when he learned he was under investigation.
When announcing the pardon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Trump appreciated the sailor’s “service to the country.”

WASHINGTON — For the second time this term, the Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday about whether voting maps can be so distorted by politics that they violate the Constitution.
As they had when an earlier case was argued in October, many of the justices agreed that partisan gerrymandering is a serious problem that disfigures democracy. But there was no indication on Wednesday that they had come to an agreement about whether the courts can address the problem.
“It seems like a pretty clear violation of the Constitution in some form to have deliberate, extreme gerrymandering,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. “But is there a practical remedy that won’t get judges involved in dozens and dozens and dozens of very important political decisions?”
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that redistricting conducted by politicians was necessarily political. “Hasn’t this court said time and again you can’t take all consideration of partisan advantage out of districting?” he asked.

Were the Supreme Court to forbid taking account of politics in drawing voting maps, he said, “I really don’t see how any legislature will ever be able to redistrict.”
Advertisement
The justices largely agreed that the oddly shaped Maryland congressional district at issue, drawn by Democrats in the Legislature, was an extreme example of distasteful political gamesmanship.
“It doesn’t seem to have any internal logic,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said of the district, which stretches from northwestern Maryland to the Washington suburbs. He added that the district had been redrawn in a way “that prefers one party over another.”
Justice Elena Kagan said it sometimes might be hard to tell when politics played too large a role, but she said that was not a problem here. “However much you think is too much,” she said, “this case is too much.”
But it was not at all clear that the court was prepared to say the Constitution may place limits on extreme partisan gerrymandering, where the party in power draws voting districts to give itself an outsize advantage in future elections.
The Supreme Court has never struck down a voting district as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. A ruling allowing such challenges could revolutionize American politics.
Wednesday’s arguments provided little information about whether the justices are prepared to take that step. Indeed, if arguments in October in the earlier case, a Democratic challenge of a Republican map from Wisconsin, had heartened opponents of extreme partisan gerrymandering, Wednesday’s arguments in the Maryland case only served to confuse them.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the crucial vote in both cases, returned to a theme he had pursued in the arguments in the Wisconsin case, asking whether a law that required partisan gerrymandering in so many words would violate the Constitution.

Steven M. Sullivan, Maryland’s solicitor general, said it would.
Justice Kennedy asked, “How is this case different?” Mr. Sullivan said the redistricting law did not expressly call for a partisan advantage.
Justice Kennedy was not satisfied. “So if you hide the evidence of what you’re doing, then you’re going to prevail?” he asked.
The court’s surprise announcement in December that it would hear the second partisan gerrymandering case, Benisek v. Lamone, No. 17-333, led to much speculation about what the move meant for the challengers in the Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161. But Wednesday’s argument did almost nothing to clear up the mystery of why the justices decided to hear a second case.

If there was a hint about where the court was headed in the Wisconsin case, it came from Justice Breyer, who suggested that the court schedule a new round of arguments in both cases, along with one from North Carolina, in the term that will start in October. His question suggested that at least some of the challengers could not demonstrate that they had suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sue.
“What would you think,” Justice Breyer asked, “of taking the three cases and setting them for re-argument on the question of standing and there we’d have all three variations in front of us?” he asked a lawyer for the challengers, Michael B. Kimberly. But Justice Breyer’s real audience seemed to be his colleagues, none of whom spoke up in support of the proposal.
Justice Breyer, who seems ready to allow constitutional challenges based on partisan gerrymandering, probably would not have made the suggestion had his views prevailed when the justices took their preliminary vote in the Wisconsin case in October.
Several justices said the Maryland case was plagued by procedural and practical problems.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there was little reason for the court to rule now because its decision would come too late to affect the 2018 elections.
“It’s much too late, even if you were successful, for there to be any change for the 2018 election,” Justice Ginsburg told Mr. Kimberly. Justice Kennedy seemed to agree. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the challengers had waited too long to file suit.
Mr. Kimberly, representing the plaintiffs, argued that Democratic state lawmakers there had redrawn a district in northwestern Maryland to retaliate against citizens who supported its longtime incumbent, Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Republican. That retaliation, he said, violated the First Amendment by diluting their voting power in a district that had been controlled by Republicans.
Advertisement
Mr. Bartlett had won his 2010 race by a margin of 28 percentage points. In 2012, he lost to Representative John Delaney, a Democrat, by a 21-point margin.
Several justices said the evidence of extreme partisan gerrymandering was strong.
“People were very upfront about what they were trying to do here, which was to create another Democratic district,” Justice Kagan said. “And they did that.”
In the past, some justices have said the court should stay out of such political disputes. Others have said partisan gerrymanders may violate the Constitution.
Justice Kennedy has taken a middle position, leaving the door to such challenges open a crack, though he has never voted to sustain one.
In 2004, he wrote in a concurring opinion on a gerrymandering case that he might consider a challenge if there were “a workable standard” to decide when such tactics crossed a constitutional line. But he said he had not seen such a standard.
In the Maryland case, a divided three-judge panel of the United States District Court in Maryland in August denied the challengers’ request for a preliminary injunction. In dissent, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, who ordinarily sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., wrote that partisan gerrymandering was a cancer on democracy.
“The widespread nature of gerrymandering in modern politics is matched by the almost universal absence of those who will defend its negative effect on our democracy,” Judge Niemeyer said. “Indeed, both Democrats and Republicans have decried it when wielded by their opponents but nonetheless continue to gerrymander in their own self-interest when given the opportunity.”
“The problem is cancerous,” he wrote, “undermining the fundamental tenets of our form of democracy.”

WASHINGTON — A top Trump campaign official had repeated communications during the final weeks of the 2016 presidential race with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a document released on Tuesday by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election.
The campaign official, Rick Gates, had frequent phone calls in September and October 2016 with a person the F.B.I. believes had active links to Russian spy services at the time, the document said. Mr. Gates also told an associate the person “was a former Russian Intelligence Officer with the G.R.U.,” the Russian military intelligence agency.
The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating numerous contacts between President Trump’s advisers and Russia-linked individuals and entities leading up to and after the November 2016 election. The document, filed in Mr. Mueller’s name, stated that the communications between Mr. Gates and the individual were “pertinent to the investigation.”
The individual is identified only as “Person A,” and the document describes him as someone who worked for Mr. Gates and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, as part of their earlier representation of Russia-aligned parties and politicians in Ukraine, including the former president of Ukraine. A person with knowledge of the matter identified Person A as Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who for years was Mr. Manafort’s right-hand man in Ukraine.
Mr. Manafort has told associates that he does not believe that Mr. Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, but the document released on Tuesday shows that Mr. Gates told others of his history in the intelligence services. That history was widely discussed for years among people who worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in Ukraine.

At the time of the calls, Mr. Gates was the Trump campaign’s liaison to the Republican National Committee and, before that, he was the campaign’s deputy chairman. Mr. Manafort served as the campaign chairman until August 2016, when he resigned amid the growing controversy about his work in Ukraine.

Both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were indicted last year for money laundering and other financial crimes committed while, the charges said, they tried to hide the money they received for their Ukraine work. Last month, Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to financial fraud and lying to investigators and has agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller’s investigation.
Mr. Manafort has vowed to fight the charges. In February 2017, he told The New York Times he had “never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government of the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today.”

But, he added, “It’s not like these people wear badges that say, ‘I’m a Russian intelligence officer.’ ”
Mr. Kilimnik was born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, and he served in the Russian Army as a linguist. Last year, as scrutiny mounted of his work with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in Ukraine, he steadfastly denied any association with Russian intelligence. An investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors into Mr. Kilimnik’s possible links to Russian spy agencies was closed late last year without charges.
Mr. Kilimnik has maintained residences in Moscow and Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, and has traveled regularly between them during years of working for Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates on behalf of various Russia-aligned oligarchs and political parties.
The new document is a sentencing memorandum for Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who pleaded guilty in February to lying to federal investigators about his conversations with Mr. Gates in 2016 about work the two men did in Ukraine.
Mr. van der Zwaan was an attorney at a firm that worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to prepare a report used to defend Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president, from international criticism over the prosecution and incarceration of one of his political rivals.
Advertisement
Mr. van der Zwaan “worked closely” on the report with Mr. Gates and Person A, according to a court filing submitted Tuesday night by Mr. van der Zwaan’s lawyers asking the judge for leniency in sentencing.
Mr. van der Zwaan originally told Mr. Mueller’s investigators that he had not spoken to Mr. Gates since August 2016, but subsequently admitted he had lied after prosecutors confronted him with evidence of conversations.
The sentencing document describes an observation by one unidentified witness in the investigation who said Mr. van der Zwaan had “gone native.”
“That is, he had grown too close to Manafort, Gates, and Person A,” the document stated.
According to the filing by his lawyers, Mr. van der Zwaan “had explored opportunities to leave Skadden to work directly for Gates and Manafort” in 2012 and 2013.

An advertising trade group that gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for its “big data” work during the 2016 presidential election is now urging marketers to reconsider the ethics of how consumer information is collected and used.
The trade group, the Advertising Research Foundation, said it was waiting for more information before formally rescinding the award given to Cambridge Analytica, the British political consulting firm that was recently reported to have improperly harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users. The revelations have brought intense criticism of Facebook, which is facing inquiries from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic around how it handles user information, and have many people taking a closer look at the role of data in online advertising.
""We’ve tended to assume that because you can do something, you should,” Scott McDonald, chief executive of the ad group, said in an interview on Tuesday. He added that advertisers had been more concerned with the accuracy and validity of data they received from technology companies than with asking whether they should be collecting that data and using it to target consumers in the first place.
Mr. McDonald addressed the Cambridge Analytica situation and the need for new guidelines during a speech on Wednesday morning at the group’s annual convention in New York.

Things were much different last year, when Cambridge Analytica won a gold prize at the foundation’s David Ogilvy Awards, which have been given annually since 1994. The firm was honored for its work for the Trump campaign, in which it identified and advertised to undecided voters.

The selection, made by a jury of ad industry leaders, was “very controversial because of the nature of the campaign,” Mr. McDonald said. But the ad group viewed itself as “Switzerland,” he said, and was simply conducting “a scientific evaluation of the quality of work.”

“Nobody had any idea the data might have been pilfered,” he said. Mr. McDonald said he planned to potentially poll the jury again and “see if the accusations are sustained” before officially stripping Cambridge Analytica of the award.
The existence of the award highlights the enthusiasm with which marketers have approached the reams of consumer data generated by digital devices and their belief that people are happy to share whatever information technology may be collecting from them.
The Advertising Research Foundation, which acknowledged that the United States may adopt new regulations on how consumer data is collected, said it planned to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting that information. Mr. McDonald said advertising had gone too far in viewing consumers as prey, noting that even the industry’s vocabulary had become militarylike.
“We talk about ad campaigns, consumers we target. We talk about subway takeovers, pop-ups,” he said. “These are fairly aggressive, and I don’t think we even think about it — they’re just embedded in the metaphors of advertising.”

Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.
He was, to my mind, an ideal Republican candidate: a conservative Midwestern governor with a crusading political biography, access to big donors and a record unspoiled by service in Washington. I enjoyed predicting to my friends in New York that he’d be the Republican nominee, and watching their surprise that I wasn’t betting on Jeb.
So it was with mixed feelings, in September 2015, that I reported a tip I got that Scott Walker was ending his campaign. I was on the Metro desk at the time but had kept up my relationships in Washington, and I teamed up with colleagues covering the primaries to confirm Mr. Walker’s surrender. It happened in a flash: I had my first scoop of the presidential race, and my political instincts were proved decisively wrong.
In retrospect, it’s easy enough to see Mr. Walker as a hopeless candidate — a too-dull-for-television personality, obsessed with campaign mechanics and untutored in important matters of policy. So rapid was the onset of Mr. Walker’s irrelevance, he never even earned a scornful, Trump-authored nickname. (Sleepin’ Scott?)
Advertisement
But blaming Mr. Walker alone — as gratifying as that might be — would miss a larger point.
Like many political reporters, I’ve spent months reflecting on the arc of 2016, pondering where my coverage might have missed the mark and why.
Advertisement
Many of the conventional explanations have been shallow and unsatisfying. It’s not the case, for instance, that the news media didn’t cover President Trump’s supporters or listen to their voices, or that reporters failed to visit the middle of the country. Scores of reporters have the datelines and airline receipts to prove it.
For me at least, the real problem of 2016 was a failure of imagination.
Much of campaign reporting is an exercise in imagination, informed by experience. You travel the country and talk to voters and activists and local officials, and you form a theory of what the electorate wants. You study public opinion and recent history to gauge which outcomes are possible and which are not. You meet candidates and size them up, on and off the record, assessing how knowledgeable, intellectually agile, and comfortable with criticism and combat they are.
And you ask yourself: Can I imagine this person scrapping their way through a debate? Or negotiating with hardheaded legislators? Or empathizing with constituents who don’t look like them?
Sometimes you misread a person. In the winter after President Barack Obama’s first election, I crossed paths with a member of the Republican National Committee who was fiercely supporting Michael Steele’s bid for chairman. Over breakfast, he came across as a blunt, unsmiling party foot soldier. There was nothing, at the time, that suggested Mike Pompeo, the man sipping coffee, could be nominated for secretary of state inside of a decade.
But more often you’re right. It turns out the easygoing Alabama trial lawyer with a heroic prosecutor’s story really did have a chance against the hard-right former judge with an attic full of unexamined skeletons. If Doug Jones was at a loss for words when he defeated Roy S. Moore, his victory came about much as Mr. Jones told me three months earlier he hoped that it would: through an energized Democratic base and mass defections among moderate Republicans appalled by Mr. Moore.
Along the way, from one campaign to the next, you build a set of instincts that guide your interpretation of events. If you’re not careful, those instincts can harden into something more like rules — the kind that tell you a Mitt Romney-like governor is a strong candidate for president and a person who offends most Americans cannot win a general election.
In 2016, I paid too much attention to those rules — the ones formed by habit and social convention, about what candidates are allowed to say and which credentials they’re supposed to have — and too little to the rules regulating who gets to vote and whose votes matter the most. Reversing those priorities, I might have anticipated the historic gulf between the popular vote and the Electoral College that made Mr. Trump president.
Yet so far in 2018, it seems even the rules chiseled into law may not control events on Election Day. If a Pennsylvania congressional district drawn to favor Republicans by a landslide margin can elect a Democrat, even by a few hundred votes, then this environment of political turbulence could bend the midterm campaign in directions beyond imagining.

WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the Second Amendment — the right to keep and bear arms — “will never be repealed,” responding to an opinion piece written by a retired Supreme Court justice who called for just that.

            THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!        
Mr. Trump’s declaration in an early morning tweet came after days of silence on the subject, despite student-organized  marches around the country over the weekend calling for more gun control.
On Tuesday, the retired Justice John Paul Stevens wrote an Op-Ed  in The New York Times calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment.
“Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement schoolchildren and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday,” Mr. Stevens wrote. “These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.”

Repealing the Second Amendment would have to be approved by Congress, and there are no signs that such a move is underway.

“It is unequivocally not the Democratic caucus’ position to repeal the Second Amendment,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday. “The president has to tweet this because he and the Republicans are reeling.”
Mr. Schumer, of New York, said the student marches are having an impact on the traditional argument about gun safety. The choice, he said, is not between gun rights and no gun rights.
“Reasonable proposals that adhere to the Second Amendment but improve gun safety such as universal background checks, protective orders and a debate on the assault weapons ban are the way of the future,” Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. Stevens retired from the Supreme Court in 2010. He wrote a major dissent about the Second Amendment in one of the court’s hardest-fought decisions. Mr. Stevens argued that the amendment does not protect an individual’s right to own firearms.
“That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power,” Mr. Stevens wrote on Tuesday, referring to the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobbying group. “Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, indicated the administration was not considering a repeal of the Second Amendment.
“The president and the administration still fully support the Second Amendment,” Ms. Sanders said on Tuesday in response to a question about Mr. Stevens’s Op-Ed. “We think that the focus has to remain on removing weapons from dangerous individuals, not on blocking all Americans from their constitutional rights.”
In his tweet, Mr. Trump also said that Democrats support repealing the Second Amendment, but that has not been the case in Congress, which is only considering modest policy changes on guns. In the 1990s, a Democratic congressman from New York introduced legislation for a repeal, but it did not get any traction. Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, did not campaign to repeal the Second Amendment.

“We can uphold Second Amendment rights while preventing senseless gun violence,” Mrs. Clinton tweeted in May 2016.
Mr. Trump had the support of the N.R.A. early in his campaign for president and has said he is “the biggest fan of the Second Amendment.” After the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last month, Mr. Trump proposed stricter controls on access to guns, particularly raising the age to purchase an assault weapon to 21 from 18. After a meeting with the N.R.A., Mr. Trump no longer advocated for an age increase.
Instead, the White House — with the support of the N.R.A. — says appropriately trained teachers should be armed to respond to future mass shootings.
“Gun free zones are proven targets of killers,” Mr. Trump tweeted on March 1.

            Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!        
Arming teachers has been widely criticized, recently by people who gathered for marches for more gun control.
At a March for Our Lives demonstration in Anchorage, Alaska, on Saturday, Melanie Anderson, a 44-year-old middle schoolteacher, held up a sign that said “teacher, not sharp shooter.”

WASHINGTON — In the final months of the Obama administration, the Justice Department announced a new approach to preparing prisoners for life beyond their cells. Officials created a prison school system, pledged money for technology training and promised to help prevent former inmates from returning to prison.
Almost immediately after taking office, Trump administration officials began undoing their work. Budgets were slashed, the school system was scrapped and studies were shelved as Attorney General Jeff Sessions brought to bear his tough-on-crime philosophy and deep skepticism of Obama-era crime-fighting policies.
Now, nearly a year and a half later, the White House has declared that reducing recidivism and improving prisoner education is a top priority — echoing some of the very policies it helped dismantle.
This whiplash approach to federal prison policy reflects the tension between Jared Kushner, the president’s reform-minded son-in-law and senior adviser, and Mr. Sessions, a hard-liner whose views on criminal justice were forged at the height of the drug war. It has left both Democratic and Republican lawmakers confused and has contributed to skepticism that the Trump administration is serious about its own proposals.

On Capitol Hill, a wholesale reconsideration of American sentencing laws and prison policies has bipartisan support. Dozens of senators have sponsored a bill to change mandatory-minimum sentences and ease drug laws that have been used to seek lengthy sentences for nonviolent offenders. The bill also includes provisions to expand education, worker training and drug rehabilitation programs in prison.

Mr. Kushner, administration officials say, supports such sweeping change. Mr. Sessions is adamantly opposed. The two men reached a compromise in recent months: Mr. Kushner could push for the prison changes, but Mr. Sessions would position the administration strongly against a broader overhaul.
In a letter to Congress last month, Mr. Sessions excoriated the bill, predicting it “would reduce sentences for a highly dangerous cohort of criminals, including repeat dangerous drug traffickers and those who use firearms.”
The letter enraged the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican chairman, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. Twenty-five senators, split nearly evenly between the two parties, have sponsored his bill, which reform advocates in both parties regard as the best chance to undo the strict laws that contribute to the United States containing the world’s largest prison population.
Mr. Sessions promised last fall that he would work with the Senate to address those laws. “We’ve never had any dialogue since,” said Mr. Grassley, one of Mr. Trump’s most important Capitol Hill allies during his first year in office. “I resent the president not helping me more, when I worked so hard to push along his judicial nominees.”
Instead, the White House is backing Mr. Kushner’s push to overhaul just prisons. “We can change the way the country thinks about prison and the job of prisons in this country,” he said during an interview in the West Wing. “I think that will save a lot of lives.”
The White House released seven principles it hopes to see in legislation. Some are specific, like expanding job-training programs in prison. Others are purely generic: “Effectively use government resources to reduce crime, enhance public safety and increase opportunity, thereby improving the lives of all Americans.”
Mr. Kushner’s father served prison time for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. His son has convinced advocates for an overhaul, even those who are not natural allies, that he personally cares about the issue.

“I do believe that Jared Kushner is earnest in his desire for criminal justice reform,” said Inimai M. Chettiar, of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. “But Jeff Sessions is still stuck in 1980. He hasn’t moved along with everyone else, including top prosecutors and police chiefs, who realize that tough-on-crime doesn’t work.”
Ms. Chettiar said she was not convinced that Mr. Kushner’s support was enough to get the administration behind real change — even in the narrow area of prisons.
The Justice Department said Mr. Sessions fully supported the White House principles and was committed to helping inmates develop the skills needed to return to society. But Mr. Sessions is not rushing to promote those efforts: Over two weeks, the Justice Department refused to make anyone available to discuss them and would not identify which prison education programs have been cut and which remain.
“They’re not going to talk to you about this,” said Joe Rojas, a teacher at the federal prison complex in Coleman, Fla. He said the Justice Department could not answer those questions without acknowledging that the Trump administration had cut more than 6,000 prison jobs.
Staffing is so short that teachers around the country are regularly reassigned to cover routine guard duties, he said.
One of the White House priorities is to offer incentives to encourage inmates to enroll in programs to prepare them for life outside prison. Mr. Rojas and others are quick to note that incentives are not the problem: Educational programs are so popular that more than 15,000 federal inmates are on waiting lists for high school equivalency diploma and literacy programs, according to a 2016 Justice Department report.
“It sounds pretty on paper,” said Mr. Rojas, who is the president of his American Federation of Government Employees union local. “But when you cut staff, you can’t do anything.”
Administration officials say it is unfair to view the White House initiative through a lens of what has been cut. Mr. Kushner got involved only after those cuts were made. As for broader overhaul efforts, he has made his case to advocates that it is better to address prison problems than do nothing.

And some longtime advocates agree, even if begrudgingly. Koch Industries, for example, lobbied hard for sweeping criminal justice changes, including more lenient sentencing. But Mark Holden, the group’s general counsel, said he saw an opportunity to improve prisons — even if it was not everything advocates wanted.
“This is something that pretty much everyone agrees with, so let’s start where there’s a consensus and build,” he said.
Mr. Grassley said that he while appreciated Mr. Kushner’s desire to get something done, he did not support any effort to try to address prisons without fixing what he saw as fundamental unfairness in sentencing laws. And he believes Mr. Kushner shares his views. “But he sees a chance of getting half a loaf, and he’s willing to settle for a half a loaf,” Mr. Grassley said. “I’m not going to.”

The White House argues that Mr. Grassley’s argument is moot because the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, will not allow a vote on a broad criminal justice bill that divides Republicans.
Mr. Grassley sees that as an excuse. “If the president would start tweeting about it every other day like he tweets about everything else, McConnell would come along,” he said.
Mr. Kushner believes that the White House can forge consensus around prison reform. He wants the federal government to look to states for proven ideas to reduce recidivism. The White House recently hired Brooke Rollins, a conservative lawyer who advocated such changes in Texas, a state that is often held up by both conservatives and liberals as a leader in reducing recidivism.
Amy Lopez, a former teacher in the Texas prison system, agreed that the federal government could learn from states. More data exists than ever before, she said, and it shows that education reduces the chance that a former inmate will be arrested again.
The Justice Department hired Ms. Lopez in 2016 to replace the patchwork prison education system with a centralized school district that offered diplomas, technology training and vocational education.

“It was interesting to have this focus at the federal level on education,” she said. “That was new.”
Within months, she was fired, the school system axed. She took a job overseeing education in Washington’s city corrections system.
Trump administration officials say that, as part of the new focus on prisons, if the school idea turns out to have been a good one, they can always reconsider it.

Update: The United States and South Korea formally announced the trade agreement in a joint statement on Wednesday, and said that it “represents important progress in improving U.S.-Korea trade and economic relations.”
WASHINGTON — President Trump scored his first significant trade deal this week, securing a pact with South Korea that represents the type of one-on-one agreement that Mr. Trump says makes the best sense for American companies and workers.
The deal, which is expected to be formally announced on Wednesday, opens the South’s market to American autos by lifting existing limits on manufacturers like Ford Motor and General Motors, extends tariffs for South Korean truck exports and restricts, by nearly a third, the amount of steel that the South can export to the United States. Mr. Trump used his threat of stiff steel and aluminum tariffs as a cudgel to extract the concessions he wanted, helping produce an agreement that had stalled amid disagreements this year.
But winning the deal may have had more to do with the geopolitical realities confronting the United States and South Korea as America embarks on tricky nuclear discussions with North Korea. The United States cannot afford a protracted trade standoff at a moment when it needs the South as an ally.
Advertisement
The trade deal came as the Chinese state news media reported that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, made an unannounced visit to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping weeks before planned summit meetings with American and South Korean leaders.
Advertisement
The political success of the trade agreement — and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations — is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington’s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president’s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.
President Emmanuel Macron of France lashed out at the approach on Tuesday, saying he was frustrated by the seemingly coercive negotiation tactics coming from Washington.
“We talk about everything, in principle, with a friendly country that respects the rules of the W.T.O.,” Mr. Macron said. “We talk about nothing, in principle, when it is with a gun to our head.”
The implications in the United States will depend on how well Mr. Trump and his allies are able to sell the deal’s direct benefits to voters in midterm elections in the fall. They did not succeed in doing so in a recent special election in Pennsylvania, where a Democrat won in a district that should have been especially receptive to Mr. Trump’s argument about trade and tariffs.
Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, said the president’s political team “must get on the ground and make sure working people understand the direct economic benefits that come from these measures — get it from being academic to simple.”
The deal with South Korea, he said, “is a big victory resulting from the president’s smart tariff policies.”
The state news media in China and North Korea confirmed that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was in the mysterious train that pulled into Beijing on Monday. It was his first official visit abroad since he took office.
The agreement is also a victory for a president whose most ardent campaign supporters were animated in part by a promise that Mr. Trump would fight for them against an international free-trade establishment that they believe had robbed them of jobs and depressed their wages.

As a candidate, Mr. Trump had repeatedly threatened to withdraw from trade deals he said were unfair to the United States and its workers — or even rip them up. Even as recently as last September, associates of the president made it clear that he was willing to withdraw from trade negotiations with South Korea if he thought the result would be unfair.
Mr. Trump has also made clear his disdain for the multicountry trade agreements that the United States has long championed. One of his first moves as president was to pull out of what was then the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that President Barack Obama had helped solidify.

On Tuesday, supporters of Mr. Trump’s protectionist approach to trade cheered the new pact as a victory for American workers and the dawn of a new era in globalization.
“The agreement with South Korea to better level the playing field on steel and autos is an encouraging sign that the administration’s trade strategy is achieving results,” said Scott N. Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. “We believe the deal’s steel provision will be as effective as a tariff in achieving the goals of strengthening our domestic industry and ensuring it can supply America’s security needs.”
Through the agreement, South Korea — the third-biggest exporter of steel to the United States in 2016 — is permanently exempt from the White House’s global tariffs of 25 percent on steel. In return, South Korea agreed to adhere to a quota of 2.68 million tons of steel exports to the United States a year, which it said was roughly equivalent to 70 percent of its annual average sent to the United States from 2015 to 2017.
The deal also doubles the number of vehicles the United States can export to South Korea without meeting local safety requirements to 50,000 per manufacturer. However, trade experts said that American companies had not come close to meeting their existing quota last year, and that American carmakers had not done enough to tailor their products for South Korean consumers, who prefer smaller vehicles. The revised agreement does ease environmental regulations that American carmakers face when selling vehicles in South Korea and makes American standards for auto parts compliant with South Korean regulations.
Importantly for the Trump administration, the agreement extends tariffs on imported South Korean trucks by 20 years to 2041. Those tariffs were set to phase out in 2021, which officials said would have harmed American truck makers.
The deal will also establish a side agreement between the United States and South Korea that is intended to deter “competitive devaluation” of both countries’ currencies — which can artificially lower the cost of imports bought by consumers — and to create more transparency on issues of monetary policy. Administration officials suggested that this new type of arrangement was likely to be replicated in other trade deals, though they acknowledged that it was not enforceable.
Senior White House officials trumpeted the addition of the currency provision to the negotiations, which would seek to prevent South Korea from reducing the value of its currency to make its goods cheaper abroad and export more to the United States. In a report published in October, the Treasury Department declined to label South Korea a currency manipulator, but placed it on a “monitoring list” for its currency practices and large trade surplus with the United States.

However, the effect of the currency agreement may be mostly symbolic, since it was signed in a side deal to the pact to avoid a lengthy legislative approval process. Unlike other provisions of the official agreement, the currency provision is not enforceable through panels that typically settle disputes, or through officially sanctioned retaliation, the usual method for policing trade deals.
The Obama administration had fought for a similar currency provision to be included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
On automobiles, the biggest source of trade tensions between the countries, the negotiation delivered modest victories that were likely to be welcomed by American carmakers who have long sought to sell more cars in South Korea. It also smoothed customs and regulatory procedures that American businesses say have made it harder to sell goods in the country.

WASHINGTON — President Trump kept a relatively low profile and did not make any public appearances on Tuesday, but emerged for a rare evening trip outside the White House to meet with deep-pocketed donors at a real estate developer’s home in Virginia.
Mr. Trump, who usually prefers a steak served at his own hotel if he leaves the confines of the White House at night, traveled to the McLean, Va., home of Giuseppe Cecchi, according to a person with knowledge of the president’s plans. Mr. Cecchi is a loyalist who previously hosted Mr. Trump for a $10,000-a-couple fund-raising dinner in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign.
Since arriving back in Washington on Sunday from his Florida estate, Mr. Trump’s schedule showed no public appearances and he kept his usual tweeting to a minimum.
He has opted instead to leave it to his aides to field questions about a continuing investigation into his campaign’s contact with Russia, allegations by a pornographic actress that his lawyer paid her to stay silent about an affair, a move to expel 60 Russian diplomats and his administration’s support for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The White House declined to offer additional information about the dinner, but stressed that it was not a fund-raiser.

“Tonight, the president will be having dinner with a group of supporters at a private residence in Virginia,” said Lindsay Walters, a deputy White House press secretary. “This dinner is not a fund-raiser. No funds have been solicited.”
It was the second time this month that Mr. Trump traveled to a private home to meet with donors. Financial executives, an oil billionaire and the president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also attended the dinner at the home of a prominent lawyer.
Even if no funds are raised at Tuesday’s dinner, it is part of a series of events intended to cultivate donors for two groups created to back Mr. Trump — America First Policies, a nonprofit formed to support his agenda, and America First Action, a “super PAC” that is supporting the campaigns of his allies and eventually his re-election campaign.
The groups, which are seeking to raise $100 million this year, have hosted a series of events featuring Mr. Trump and top administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence.
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Pence headlined an “America First” rally in Fargo, N.D.
“They’re trying to rally people around the tax cuts, and show how they have impacted local communities,” said Dan K. Eberhart, an Arizona oil investor and Republican donor who is an adviser to America First Policies and who attended the Fargo event.
Headed into the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans are mostly facing a treacherous landscape in which they fear that Mr. Trump could be a liability in suburban districts.

America First intends to help balance the playing field, partly by dispatching administration officials into areas that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016, and partly by raising money from wealthy supporters to fund ads bolstering Republicans.
The involvement of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence is considered a key to the fund-raising efforts of the groups.

America First Policies and America First Action are overseen by the veteran Republican operative Brian O. Walsh.
“America First Action is extremely honored to host President Trump as our special guest, along with supporters and friends of our organization,” he said in a statement. “We ensure that our activities at all times remain in full compliance with the law and ethics rules.”
America First Action has been a popular source of income for Trump loyalists, including Corey Lewandowski, and the president’s newly named re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale. The group’s goal with the dinners is to connect supporters of Mr. Trump with policy leaders, and to give face time to the people who had shown the president the most support, a person with knowledge of the process said.
In 2016, Mr. Cecchi and his wife, Mercedes, also hosted donors at his home. Mr. Cecchi who at one point was known as the “condo king” of Washington, is known for developing the Watergate complex.
For that event, attendees had to pay $10,000 to $100,000 for a photo opportunity with Mr. Trump and the chance to mingle with Reince Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Steven T. Mnuchin, the finance chairman at the time for the Trump campaign.
Mr. Cecchi could not be reached for comment. When reached by telephone, Mr. Cecchi’s son John did not offer further details of the event.
“Whatever he’s doing,” John Cecchi, who was on the host committee of the 2016 event, said of his father, “I’m sure he’s psyched about it.”

WASHINGTON — At least 12 states signaled Tuesday that they would sue to block the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, arguing that the change would cause fewer Americans to be counted and violate the Constitution.
The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said he was leading a multistate lawsuit to stop the move, and officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington said they would join the effort. The State of California filed a separate lawsuit late Monday night.
“The census is supposed to count everyone,” said Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts. “This is a blatant and illegal attempt by the Trump administration to undermine that goal, which will result in an undercount of the population and threaten federal funding for our state and cities.”
The Constitution requires that every resident of the United States be counted in a decennial census, whether or not they are citizens. The results are used not just to redraw political boundaries from school boards to House seats, but to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and subsidies to where they are needed most. Census data provide the baseline for planning decisions made by corporations and governments alike.

Opponents of the added citizenship question said it was certain to depress response to the census from noncitizens and even legal immigrants. Critics accused the administration of adding the question to reduce the population count in the predominantly Democratic areas where more immigrants reside, in advance of state and national redistricting in 2021.

The Trump administration defended the citizenship question by saying it was needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, which relies on accurate estimates of voting-eligible populations.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a briefing that the decision to gather citizenship data through the decennial census was “necessary for the Department of Justice to protect voters.”
“I think that it is going to determine the individuals in our country, and provide information that allows us to comply with our own laws and with our own procedures,” she said.
Asked whether there would be outreach to ensure participation in immigrant-heavy regions like California, Ms. Sanders said she was “not aware of those specifics.”
Ms. Sanders also said the citizenship question had “been included in every census since 1965, with the exception of 2010, when it was removed.”
In fact, various citizenship questions have appeared in many censuses since 1850, especially during periods of high immigration. But it was dropped from the 1960 general census (there was no census in 1965) and relegated in 1970 to a longer list of questions that were asked of a small minority of residents. After 2000, the question was asked only on the American Community Survey, a separate mandatory poll of a fraction of the population that is conducted more frequently than the census.
Critics noted that the citizenship question was added at the last minute — the deadline for proposing new questions for the 2020 head count is April 1 — and that it sidestepped the years of vetting undergone by every other question that will be asked. This month, they added, President Trump’s re-election campaign used the addition of a citizenship question in an emailed fund-raising appeal.
Advertisement
Mr. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that adding the question was a “reckless decision to suddenly abandon nearly 70 years of practice.” He argued that the move “will create an environment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities that would make impossible both an accurate census and the fair distribution of federal tax dollars.”
In a seven-page announcement released late Monday, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the secretary of commerce, foresaw those concerns, and sought to allay them. Decades of experience with citizenship questions on earlier censuses and other surveys, he stated, indicate that including it on the 2020 form would not deter people from volunteering to be counted. And he noted that other democracies, from Australia to the United Kingdom, routinely ask about citizenship in their head counts without any difficulty.
Mr. Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, acknowledged that both outside experts and leaders within the bureau had been opposed to the change. But he said that “neither the Census Bureau nor the concerned stakeholders could document that the response rate would in fact decline materially.”
And although the citizenship question was not tested for inclusion on the 2020 form, he said, it is used in the American Community Survey.
Kenneth Prewitt, a director of the Census Bureau under President Clinton, dismissed the administration’s rationale that the question is needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act.
“It’s certainly unnecessary,” said Mr. Prewitt, now a professor of public affairs at Columbia University. “The Voting Rights Act is being administered very well with data from the American Community Survey. The Justice Department has ruled on that a number of times over the last 15 years.”

The decision to add a question potentially throws a new degree of uncertainty into census preparations that already are well behind schedule and starved for money. The only full dress rehearsal of the 2020 census, unfolding this month in Providence County, R.I., has been scaled back in some areas. Tens of thousands of forms mailed to local residents this month do not contain the citizenship question.
Experts dismissed Mr. Ross’s statement that the citizenship question did not need further testing, arguing that the census and the American Community Survey differ in almost every aspect, from size to public awareness to whether a response is required. “When you do this once every 10 years, for 340 million people, you’ve got to get it right,” said William H. Frey, a University of Michigan demographer.
Advertisement
On Tuesday, critics of Mr. Ross’s decision made available a letter sent to Mr. Ross in January from six former directors of the Census Bureau who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The letter stated that they were “deeply concerned” that adding the citizenship question would “considerably increase the risks to the 2020 enumeration.”
“There is a great deal of evidence that even small changes in survey question order, wording and instructions can have significant, and often unexpected, consequences for the rate, quality and truthfulness of response,” said the former directors, who included Mr. Prewitt. “The effect of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census on data quality and census accuracy, therefore, is completely unknown.”
Several of the states suing the Trump administration are run by Democrats, who risk losing representation if the census undercounts people of color.
Carmen Queveda, an undocumented immigrant in Los Angeles, said on Tuesday she was not about to step out of her house to participate in a census that inquires whether she is a citizen.
“I would never answer, because I don’t have papers,” said the 46-year-old native of Guatemala, who is also the mother of a 14-year-old American boy. “Obviously, I am afraid. I have a son.”
The last official estimate of the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States, made in 2012 by the Department of Homeland Security, placed the number at 11.4 million.
At a morning E.S.L. class in Queens, N.Y., at Sunnyside Community Services, about 30 students hailing from Spanish-speaking countries, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, were asked about the citizenship question by Johan Lopez, New York City’s director of adult and immigrant services. Mr. Lopez said their answer alarmed him.
“I asked them directly how this would affect their ability to respond or whether they would even open the door,” he said. All but one “suggested that they likely wouldn’t open the door.”
An earlier version of this story referred incorrectly to the American Community Survey. It is required by federal law; it is not voluntary.

WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, recently warned dozens of foreign diplomats — including the Russian ambassador — that the United States would retaliate if adversaries abroad meddled in its coming elections.
“To those who would try to attack our democracy, to affect our elections, to affect the elections of other countries, to undermine national sovereignty, I have a word of warning: Don’t,” Ms. Nielsen told an estimated 80 foreign envoys and other officials during a speech last week, according to a person in attendance.
Two other people with knowledge of the event confirmed the comments. All three spoke on the condition of anonymity because the remarks were given at a closed-door meeting.
It was an unusually stern warning by Ms. Nielsen, and was among the harshest threats of retaliation by a member of President Trump’s cabinet. Ms. Nielsen is one of the most outspoken advocates of the administration’s policies, and has resisted being drawn into the controversy over Russian meddling during the 2016 election that put Mr. Trump in office.

Ms. Nielsen told the dignitaries gathered at Blair House, the presidential guesthouse, that election tampering would be detected and meddling states would suffer consequences, according to the person in attendance.

The New York Times obtained a list of people who attended, including ambassadors from across the world. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman confirmed the speech at Blair House but declined to provide details.

Ms. Nielsen’s speech came a week after Mr. Trump said “it certainly looks like the Russians were behind” a nerve-gas attack in Salisbury, England, that poisoned a former Russian spy and his daughter. Two dozen countries, including the United States, have since expelled Russian officials in a punishing diplomatic purge.
But otherwise, Mr. Trump has mocked the notion of election meddling by Moscow, at times calling it a “hoax,” concocted by Democrats and Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the race, after they lost. American intelligence agencies, however, have concluded that Russia did interfere in 2016 and intends to continue during midterm elections in November.
The Department of Homeland Security is working with state and local election officials to protect electoral systems from cyberattacks. Congress last week approved spending $380 million for states and localities to step up its online security efforts during the 2018 midterm campaign.
During a Senate hearing last week on election security, Ms. Nielsen said the department was speeding up security clearances to give state and local officials classified threat briefings. So far, about 20 state election officials have received full security clearances while others have received interim clearances.
She also said the department had given in-depth vulnerability assessments of voting systems to 15 of 19 states that so far had requested them. The remaining states will get that assistance before Election Day, Ms. Nielsen said.
One department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Ms. Nielsen’s speech underscored her intent to prevent digital intrusions by foreign nations on critical infrastructure systems such as banks, electric utilities and election systems.
Election systems were designated as critical infrastructure by Jeh Johnson, the former homeland security secretary to President Barack Obama. The designation guarantees that states are given priority assistance when they request help and greater access to information on online vulnerabilities. The federal assistance is voluntary.

WASHINGTON — President Trump said Tuesday that several thousand Liberians who have been living in the United States under a temporary immigrant status will have one year to return to their country or they will face deportation.
The president said in a memo to the secretary of state that he was formally ending a program that has allowed Liberian immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally since 1999, when President Bill Clinton established it in response to conditions in the country after a civil war.
More than 800,000 Liberians were displaced by the war and fled the country. Some sought refuge in the United States.
The program, known as Deferred Enforced Departure, has been renewed for Liberians since, giving the immigrants the ability to remain in the United States without fear of deportation. But in the memo, Mr. Trump cited the improved conditions in Liberia as evidence that the program was no longer needed.

“Liberia is no longer experiencing armed conflict and has made significant progress in restoring stability and democratic governance,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Liberia has also concluded reconstruction from prior conflicts, which has contributed significantly to an environment that is able to handle adequately the return of its nationals.”

Advocates for Liberians in the United States had urged Mr. Trump to simply extend the protections. Members of Congress from Minnesota, which has the largest Liberian population in the country, wrote a letter to Mr. Trump this month to echo those requests.

“Many of these people have been in our state for decades, and they are an important part of our communities, where they serve as business owners, teachers and health care workers,” the lawmakers wrote, asking for an extension of the program.
On Tuesday, Emira Woods, a Liberian-American advocate for immigrants, described the president’s decision as a mixed bag. She noted the year that Liberians have before facing deportation, but said ending the program would force them to abandon lives in the United States. “Many of these Liberians had children in the United States,” she said.
The Deferred Enforced Departure program for Liberians was scheduled to expire Saturday. Though he declined to renew the program, Mr. Trump ordered what he called an “orderly transition” so that Liberians living in the United States could get their affairs in order before returning to Liberia. That period will extend for 12 months, Mr. Trump wrote.
The decision about the Liberian program mirrors the actions the Trump administration has taken toward other, larger groups of immigrants in the United States. Since taking office, the president has ended temporary protected status for certain immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan, arguing that conditions have improved significantly in those countries.

WASHINGTON — President Trump wants to replace his secretary of veterans affairs, David Shulkin, but for a man who practically trademarked “You’re fired,” the president is reluctant to pull the trigger, choosing instead to leave the embattled secretary twisting amid reports of his imminent ouster.
Mr. Shulkin, a former hospital executive and medical doctor who remains widely popular on Capitol Hill, has so far averted his gaze from the White House and pressed on with his duties, albeit with a diminished profile.
The peculiar, painful dance between the president and his once-prized veterans affairs chief has become a symbol for how Mr. Trump often handles personnel matters — publicly, without concern for ending the drama quickly, and with a hope that offending employees will decide to leave instead of forcing the president to oust them. In this case, the standoff has left rudderless a vast federal bureaucracy of about 370,000 employees that serves more than 20 million veterans.
Exactly when the latest White House drama would conclude was still uncertain on Tuesday. Mr. Trump told friends over the weekend that he planned to fire Mr. Shulkin in the immediate future. But Monday came and went without any change and the president’s advisers said he had no clear option for an immediate successor.

Raj Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday afternoon that he had “no personnel announcements to make at this time,” when asked to characterize the relationship between the two men.

The reversal of fortunes for Mr. Shulkin, a rare holdover from the Obama administration, has been swift. For months, as Mr. Shulkin delivered a series of bipartisan legislative victories to a White House badly in need of them, Mr. Trump showered him in praise. At one such bill-signing ceremony in June, Mr. Trump teased that the secretary need never worry about hearing his “Apprentice”-era catchphrase, “You’re fired.”
But that support began to erode in February, after the department’s inspector general released a blistering report that found “serious derelictions” related to a business trip taken by the secretary to Britain and Denmark last year. It concluded that the secretary had spent much of the trip sightseeing and improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift.
The report provided ammunition for Mr. Shulkin’s critics within the department, who had increasingly broken with the secretary over how to approach one of the White House’s top policy priorities: the expansion of government-subsidized private health care for veterans. A handful of officials — including his two top communications deputies — worked behind the scenes to try to use the document to build support for his ouster.
Perhaps more consequentially for Mr. Shulkin, Mr. Trump’s advisers say White House officials began to believe that Mr. Shulkin misled them about what would be in the report, which ushered in a new round of negative news media reports on the president’s cabinet. He made matters worse, they said, when he botched attempts to clean up the story and went public with fears about appointees “trying to undermine the department from within.”

As stories about potential replacements began to circulate in mid-March, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Shulkin to the Oval Office for what one person briefed on the discussion described as a tense meeting. An aide to Mr. Shulkin disputed that characterization.
Mr. Shulkin has played down speculation about his departure as he has testified about the department’s budget request for the coming fiscal year and met privately with lawmakers to discuss pending legislation to remake the department’s approach to private care. He was scheduled to host a regular meeting on Thursday with leaders of the nation’s largest veterans groups.
But he has proceeded with a curtailed public profile. The secretary was not on hand for a veterans event at the White House on Friday, for instance, and he is now hurried in and out of events by a security detail without taking questions from the press. Those who have spoken with the secretary said he had made it clear that he wanted to continue in the department’s top job, but was increasingly isolated.

Ashleigh F. Barry, a spokeswoman for the secretary, said on Tuesday only that Mr. Shulkin was focused on the work of the department.
The speculation and mixed messages coming out of the White House have flummoxed key lawmakers in both parties, who continue to support the secretary, as well as many of the major veterans groups, which are congressionally chartered and largely apolitical. Organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion hold considerable sway over veterans policy in Washington, and they solidly back Mr. Shulkin.
Though the groups were generally displeased with the findings turned up by the inspector general, they see the secretary as a pragmatic and effective leader who understands the challenges facing the department’s sprawling health care system and has taken concrete steps to address them.
“We are disappointed about all this speculation that is happening because we feel that the secretary has done a good job of leading the V.A. in a positive direction,” said Garry Augustine, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans.
The groups and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are closely watching for candidates to replace Mr. Shulkin, many of them fearful that the White House might try to use the nomination to advance a long-held conservative goal of shifting more of the department’s health care to private doctors. A nominee seen as too aggressive on privatization would likely face a difficult path to confirmation in the Senate, where Republicans have only the narrowest of majorities and several key Republicans have indicated an uneasiness with several of the names floated by people close to the White House.
Those candidates include Jeff Miller, a former Florida congressman who led the House Veterans Affairs Committee and is now a lobbyist in Washington; Keith Kellogg, a retired three-star Army general who serves as the chief of staff of the National Security Council; and Leo Mackay Jr., a former deputy secretary at the department who is now an executive at Lockheed Martin. Mr. Trump has also discussed the job with Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
Another potential nominee, Pete Hegseth, is said to be uninterested in the nomination. Mr. Hegseth is a weekend co-host of “Fox & Friends” who formerly ran Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative veterans advocacy group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The group has led the push to let veterans use their government benefits at private doctors.
In the meantime, Mr. Shulkin may not be the only department official on his way out. Several high-ranking officials opposed to the secretary have indicated that they, too, intend to leave. Darin Selnick, an influential conservative voice on veterans issues within the administration, departed a position on the White House’s Domestic Policy Council on Friday and has decided to leave the administration entirely. Others, including the department’s assistant secretaries for communications and legislative affairs and its press secretary, have indicated to allies that they are searching for jobs elsewhere in the administration.

WASHINGTON — The United States census is so much more than just a head count. It is a snapshot of America that determines how congressional seats are apportioned, how state and federal dollars are distributed, where businesses choose to ship products and where they build new stores. To do all that properly, the count needs to be accurate.
The Commerce Department’s decision to restore a citizenship question to the census beginning in 2020 is prompting concerns about curtailing participation and possibly undercounting people living in the United States, particularly immigrants and minority groups who are expressing discomfort with answering questions from census workers.
Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, acknowledged concerns about decreased response rates in a memorandum released on Monday night. But he said asking about citizenship would enhance the results by helping calculate the percentage of the population eligible to vote.
An undercount of the population would have far-reaching implications. It could skew the data that are used to determine how many congressional representatives each state gets and their representation in state legislatures and local government bodies. It would shape how billions of dollars a year are allocated, including for schools and hospitals. It would undermine the integrity of a wide variety of economic data and other statistics that businesses, researchers and policymakers depend on to make decisions, including the numbers that underpin the forecasts for Social Security beneficiaries.

Here are several of the commercial, political and research efforts that depend on accurate census data:
The Constitution requires the government to enumerate the number of people living in the United States every 10 years, and to use that data to apportion the seats in Congress among the states. The calculation is based on total resident population — which means citizens and noncitizens alike — and it generally shifts power between the states once a decade, in line with population and migration trends.
States including Texas, Florida, Colorado and Oregon are projected to gain seats after the 2020 numbers are in. Illinois, Ohio, New York and West Virginia are among the states expected to lose seats. An undercount could shift those projections.
Advertisement
Lawmakers also use census data to draw congressional district boundaries within states, an often-controversial process that can help decide partisan control of the House. Census data also underpin state legislative districts and local boundaries like City Councils and school boards.
The federal government bases a large amount of its spending decisions on census data. Researchers concluded last year that in the 2015 fiscal year, 132 government programs used information from the census to determine how to allocate more than $675 billion, much of it for programs that serve lower-income families, including Head Start, Medicare, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Pell grants for college and reduced-price school lunch programs. Highway spending is also apportioned according to census data.
To sell products and services, companies large and small need good information on the location of potential customers and how much money they might have to spend. The census provides the highest-quality and most consistent information on such items, and businesses have come to depend on it to make critical choices.
Census data help companies decide where to locate distribution centers to best serve their customers, where to expand or locate new stores and where they have the best chance of seeing a high return on investment. That is why business groups have been particularly concerned about the integrity of that data.
“The 2020 census is used to help construct many other data products produced by the federal government,” said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who writes frequently on the importance of census data for policymakers and the private sector.

“Some of those products are heavily used by businesses when determining where to open new stores and expand operations, or even what items to put on their shelves. This affects retail businesses, for sure, but businesses in many other sectors as well,” he added.

Low response rates from any one demographic group would undermine the validity of various population-wide statistics and program planning.
Scientists use census data to understand the distribution of diseases and health concerns such as cancer and obesity across the United States population, including drilling down to race and ethnicity to identify health patterns across demographics. Public health officials then use the data to target their interventions in at-risk communities. Inaccurate census data could lead public health officials to invest in solving a problem that does not exist — or worse, to overlook one that does.
“It’s getting harder to conduct the census, due to a variety of factors, including increasing cultural & linguistic diversity, and distrust of the government,” said Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, an economist who directs the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. “The addition of the citizenship question will make the enumerators’ jobs even harder by heightening privacy concerns and reducing participation among immigrants, who may fear the information will be used to harm them or their families.”
An undercount in the census could also impact forecasts about Social Security payouts, which are already increasing as a share of the federal government’s revenue.
When Congress plans for the costs of the country’s Social Security needs, lawmakers rely upon demographic projection about the population’s future: the number of children expected to be born, the number of people expected to die, and the number of people expected to immigrate. If baseline data regarding the current population are inaccurate, future projections could be skewed, causing financial challenges down the line.

Breitbart News is taking a step into the live events business.
Following the lead of other media companies seeking fresh sources of revenue, the right-wing news and opinion site is set to host its first-ever town hall in suburban New Orleans next month, a panel on privacy and technology with the commentator Ann Coulter and Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash.”
It’s an experiment for a site that has lately been confronting declining web traffic and turbulence in its top ranks. Stephen K. Bannon, the site’s longtime executive chairman, was forced out in January. Its page views last month were down by nearly half from a year earlier, according to the data-tracking firm comScore, though Breitbart disputes the figure.
The Louisiana event is “the latest evolution in how to consume Breitbart content,” said Alexander Marlow, the site’s editor in chief.
By branching into public forums, the site is taking a cue from one of its perennial foes: the mainstream media. News outlets like Vanity Fair, The Washington Post and The New York Times have long sponsored conferences and speaking events.

The Breitbart event is to be held on April 5 at Andrea’s, an Italian restaurant in Metairie, La. The topic — the gatekeeping power of Facebook and other online platforms — coincides with a broader conservative offensive against Big Tech. Breitbart is one of several right-wing sites that have accused Facebook, Google and Twitter of suppressing right-wing voices, claims that the tech companies have denied.

The panel will be live-streamed — on Facebook.
Mr. Marlow, who will serve as moderator, said that tickets to the event would be free and that costs would be partly covered by Free Our Internet, a group that bills itself as “fighting the tech-left’s takeover of the internet.”

Mr. Schweizer, who collaborated with Mr. Bannon on his investigations into Hillary Clinton, is finishing a documentary about the role of tech companies in filtering the news. Another scheduled guest, Robert Epstein, a former editor of Psychology Today, is expected to be featured in Mr. Schweizer’s film.
Breitbart was a champion of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, which Mr. Bannon eventually joined. The site has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and its writers routinely flog the establishment media: Last year, its reporters worked to undercut reporting by The Washington Post about misconduct by Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama.
Mr. Bannon’s ouster, from the White House and then from Breitbart, cut into the site’s cachet. But Breitbart is still among the top-ranked sites on Facebook, and several of its journalists were treated as celebrities at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference.
Facebook’s handling of its users’ data has come under scrutiny in part because of a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked on the Trump campaign and was co-founded by Mr. Bannon. Facebook has banned the company from its platform, saying it misused personal data from Facebook that was provided to it.
Mr. Marlow said he knew little about Mr. Bannon’s role in the company, though he defended Cambridge Analytica as engaging in the same kind of data-driven electioneering that left-leaning groups have done in the past.

One was Photoshopped tearing up the Constitution — a falsehood — and criticized for wearing a flag that represented her Cuban heritage.
A conservative blog said that another wasn’t even at the school during the killings — then had to backtrack on Monday when that also proved false.
The attacks on the teenage survivors of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., have been fierce from the beginning, and have only continued since the students helped spearhead hundreds of protests this weekend.
Two of the most vocal survivors, Emma González, 18, and David Hogg, 17, have been targets of a disproportionate amount of vitriol.
Advertisement
In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Hogg said they had been singled out because of their prominence and emphasized that ad hominem attacks would not end school shootings.
Advertisement
“I mean, we’re kind of the faces of the movement,” he said. “Together we kind of form an unstoppable force that terrifies them.”
He added that he and Ms. González were being attacked “because they know we’re strong.”
Here are a few of the recent attempts to discredit the students.
RedState, a conservative blog, ran an “update” Monday evening to a story it had published that questioned whether Mr. Hogg was present at Marjory Stoneman Douglas during the day of the shooting.
Sarah Rumpf, a writer for RedState, had questioned Mr. Hogg after watching an interview where he said he rode his bike to the school on the day of the shooting to interview his classmates.
The bike trip was described in a Vox article written in February. It indicated that Mr. Hogg had been at school during the shooting, as widely confirmed by many news organizations. He had left campus and then rode his bike back that evening to interview classmates.
Video has shown that Mr. Hogg was in a closet during the shooting. Ms. Rumpf eventually found the article and video, and apologized.
RedState struck through the old article, but did not describe the update as a correction, seeming to blame the misinformation on confusing reports elsewhere. The false report was spread by well-known conservatives, including Erick Erickson, who has contributed to The New York Times opinion section. Mr. Erickson later deleted his original tweet.

            I tweeted @rumpfshaker’s story last night that she had gotten wrong. I deleted it when it became clear she got it wrong and I posted the correction. This will be the basis of a WaPo story attacking conservatives for not being sympathetic to the gun-control zealots from Parkland.        
The doctored image of Ms. González ripping apart the Constitution of the United States, began to spread during the march on Saturday. It was falsified from a Teen Vogue image in which she was pictured ripping apart a paper shooting target.
Advertisement
The image, which exists in a gray area between meme and misinformation, was promoted on Gab, the alt-right alternative to Twitter, and by the right-wing actor Adam Baldwin.
Some claimed the image to be satire, and similar memes of President Trump and other political figures appear across the spectrum. But the political scientist Emily Thorson has pointed out that their spread contributes to a climate of misinformation, even if those who see the images understand them to be fake.
Steve King, the Republican congressman from Iowa, posted on Facebook about the Cuban flag sewn to Ms. González’s jacket.
“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish,” the post said, “and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self-defense.” It showed an image of her with the flag patch visible on her jacket.
The post and similar ones angered other survivors of gun violence and even some of Mr. King’s fellow conservatives, who pointed out that the Cuban flag has long been used by dissidents from the Castro regime.

            Lots of misinformation going around about this, so I’ll try to set it straight.Cuba’s flag has been used by the country since 1902, before they adopted communism. It’s even regularly displayed in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood – where the people are no fans of Castro. pic.twitter.com/7frhMzvEdP 
Ms. González retweeted Mr. Hogg’s response to Mr. King: “She’s a beautiful woman of Cuban descent and we love her. You would too if you ever got the chance to meet her.”
She also retweeted another of Mr. Hogg’s tweets, which called on Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida of Cuban descent, to respond to Mr. King.

            Hey @marcorubio @Emma4Change s family fled Cuba to escape totalitarianism and live in freedom just like your family could you please respond to @SteveKingIA 
The conservative writer and commentator Dan McLaughlin suggested that reporters ask Ms. González “what the flag means to her and why she wears it.” She did not respond to a call Tuesday.

Many attacks on the Parkland students do not even pretend to focus on issues or substance. They include the false conspiracy trope that the students are paid actors. Sometimes their appearances and intelligence are mocked, including their efforts to get accepted to colleges this spring.
On Sunday, the conservative podcaster and vocal Trump supporter Bill Mitchell referred to Mr. Hogg as a “Damien, Children of the Corn, Hitler-Youth type” on Twitter.
The vitriol has sometimes backfired. A Republican candidate for the Maine State House dropped out of the race after calling Ms. González a “skinhead lesbian” and Mr. Hogg a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.”
In a Tuesday interview, Nicole Hockley, whose young son Dylan was killed in the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., advised the students to ignore the attacks as much as possible. She recalled that she had faced conspiracy theories and personal attacks after her 6-year-old son was killed along with 19 other first graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
She remembered how that felt: “All I’m trying to do is make it so this doesn’t happen to other people and you’re attacking me without a lot of basis.”
She said that it was also important to hear rational criticism when trying to find common ground on the issues.
When dealing with more reasonable opponents and critics she tries to de-escalate the conversations, she said, to learn more about what they think and educate them about her views.
“Sometimes there’s a new perspective that I haven’t considered,” she said, though she rarely finds such views persuasive. Still, she said, those conversations “can bear a lot of fruit.”

ECONOMIC SCENE
MARCH 27, 2018

Since the days of the Nixon administration nearly 50 years ago, American policy has aimed to steer China out of its isolation to prosper in the global market economy. There needn’t be conflict between the established superpower and the emerging giant, the best strategic minds argued. As it grew rich, they reasoned, China could be integrated peacefully into the institutional framework built by the Western powers from the rubble of World War II.
The proposition fit with the “liberal peace” view of foreign relations: that nations engaged in intense economic intercourse would find it too costly to go to war. American businesses that flocked to China to tap its cheap labor and huge consumer market after its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 enthusiastically agreed with the approach.
That strategy, it appears, is over.
President Trump’s announcement last week that the United States would impose a battery of tariffs against as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods while restricting Chinese investments in American technology companies has set policy onto a different, more belligerent path. China is now, in the president’s words, an “economic enemy.”
Interestingly, not all scholars have opposed the change of tone. Many foreign policy experts agree that China is not playing by the rules. American businesses, which typically endorsed forbearance to protect their market access to China, have grown frustrated at its appropriation of their intellectual property.
Advertisement
John Mearsheimer, a foreign policy expert at the University of Chicago, doesn’t buy the idea of liberal peace. In “The Tragedy of Great Power Politics,” published in 2001, he wrote, “A wealthy China would not be a status quo power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional hegemony.”
Advertisement
And yet Mr. Trump’s hard-line approach to China seems destined to fail. Taking a stand against China’s abusive behaviors is not necessarily wrong. The problem with the president’s game plan is that it is inconsistent with all the other diplomatic initiatives he has taken so far. The tangle of stabs and swipes at allies and rivals alike, in the service of ill-conceived goals like closing a trade deficit, serves China more than it does the United States.
“Trump has been a godsend for China,” noted Eswar Prasad, an expert on trade at Cornell University who once headed the China division at the International Monetary Fund. “China has manipulated the rules, but Trump’s response is counterproductive.”
China is clearly chafing at the rules put together by the West. It openly disagrees with the postwar apportionment of the South China Sea. It is more than willing to flout the World Trade Organization’s intellectual property rules to build its domestic technological expertise.
Several Chinese initiatives — its One Belt, One Road effort to build infrastructure to connect to Central Asia, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership it hopes to negotiate with its Asian neighbors, and its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank — are aimed at building an institutional framework to rival the trade agreements and multinational financial institutions supported by the West.
As a counterweight, Washington could strengthen the global institutions that support its own view of fair play, like the World Trade Organization, which the United States took such trouble to build. It could build new ones, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, open to China as long as it agreed to abide by the rules. It could nail down its vast web of alliances in Asia and around the world — to ensure it wouldn’t confront China alone.
That is not, however, what Mr. Trump is doing. Ditching the Trans-Pacific Partnership, imposing new tariffs on Japanese steel and hinting that the United States may even walk away from the W.T.O. all serve China’s goal of undermining the arrangements and institutions that stand in its way. “Trump is a blessing for them,” Mr. Prasad argued. “All they were trying to do, Trump is ramping up a couple of levels.”
Where might Mr. Trump lead relations between the two biggest economies on earth?
The outcome doesn’t have to be horrible. Mr. Trump’s willingness to slap real punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, regardless of the collateral damage they may cause on the American economy, gives Washington some leverage in its face-off with Beijing. It could be deployed productively.

A decade ago, American pressure gave the Chinese government political space to let its currency appreciate and cool its runaway export growth. Today, American pressure could help Beijing make an argument to curb China’s excess capacity in steel and aluminum.

Washington’s threats could also help Chinese leaders build a legal system to protect intellectual property, a necessary step if China is to become a more innovative economy that develops its own technologies. Mr. Trump could even get China to offer more market access for agricultural products and other valuable American exports.
While Professor Mearsheimer argues that the United States should aim to contain China by preventing it from expanding its influence or conquering territory in Asia and by building alliances to hem in Chinese power, Robert J. Art, a professor of international relations at Brandeis University, argues that the United States and China can make a deal.
China and the United States would both benefit from stability in the Taiwan Strait and a peaceful reunification of Taiwan and China, Professor Art said. Both would prefer a denuclearized Korean Peninsula as well as a peaceful resolution of China’s maritime disputes. Both would prefer that Japan not acquire nuclear weapons. Notably, both would prefer maintaining an open economic order.
Mr. Trump seems uninterested in either path. Indeed, the uncertainty hanging over America’s relations with China is really a question about what the president ultimately wants. Is the objective to balance bilateral trade? Does he hope to slow China’s growth, to prevent it from becoming a formidable rival? Both are probably unachievable.
Trade deficits cannot be negotiated away. The United States will run a deficit as long as it depends on foreign money to close the gap between what it saves and what it spends. Slowing China’s growth unilaterally is also pretty much impossible. There are too many countries that have little sympathy for Mr. Trump’s objectives and are willing to trade with Asia’s biggest economy. Washington might slow China’s technological progress but seems unlikely to stop it.
The worry among economists and foreign policy experts alike is that Mr. Trump’s stand on China is determined by domestic politics alone. The president doesn’t know what he wants out of a relationship with China, nor what the United States could feasibly achieve. He has figured out what his voters would like. That, apparently, is enough.
American workers are fed up with China. They believe the Asian giant’s entrance into the world economy cost them their jobs and undercut their wages. Up to a point, they are right. Their itch to punish it, however, is misguided. And allowing their irritation to shape American policy toward China is wrong.
The view that China would peacefully rise within the West’s institutional framework may have proved hopelessly naïve. Reorienting Washington’s China policy to fit the frustration of workers in Michigan could prove disastrous.

Five of those who were pardoned faced potential deportation.Trump&amp;rsquo;s criticism of the pardon power could remind the public that Trump has refused to rule out using it himself on key figures implicated in the ongoing&amp;nbsp;Russia probe. The New York Times reported this week that Trump&amp;rsquo;s attorney had floated the idea of pardoning former advisors Michael Flynn, Trump&amp;rsquo;s former national security advisor,&amp;nbsp;and Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman.Leaving the prospect of pardons open could discourage some people from cooperating fully with the investigation in an effort to win Trump&amp;rsquo;s favor.Trump&amp;rsquo;s tweets were issued while he was beginning his day at a golf club he owns in West Palm Beach.While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that...&amp;mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018

...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!&amp;mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018

Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews
President Trump blasted California Gov. Jerry Brown for using his pardon powers, in a series of pre-Easter Twitter attacks.
Trump disparaged Brown with his old “Moonbeam” nickname and then criticized him for issuing Good Friday pardons, part of a tradition for Brown around the Easter season.
“Is this really what the great people of California want?” Trump wrote, listing some of the crimes committed by those either pardoned or issued clemency by Brown, including spousal abuse.
It seems at times like a reality television show.
President Trump has ousted more than two dozen members of his administration, creating the impression of chaos and a national guessing game of who will be next.
Most of the casualties have been senior aides — remember Stephen K. Bannon and Anthony Scaramucci? Of his original Cabinet — positions that require confirmation by the Senate — a total of three have been dismissed or forced to resign. They are Tom Price (secretary of Health and Human Services), Rex Tillerson (secretary of State) and, this week, David Shulkin (secretary of Veterans Affairs).
President Trump said Thursday that he may put a hold on a new trade deal with South Korea just to make sure things are “moving along very nicely” in talks to end the nuclear program in North Korea.
The musing came in a rambling Trump speech about roads and bridges, where he broke off from the main topic repeatedly. To the surprise and confusion of many, Trump drew a possible link between the recently announced trade deal with South Korea and the joint effort by the U.S. and South Korea to enter into talks with North Korea.
The Trump administration announced this week a new trade deal that will lift steel tariffs on South Korea in exchange for greater access to their auto market, an agreement that both sides find economically advantageous. But Trump apparently thinks the deal might be valuable as a bargaining chip in the other conversation, too.
A federal judge in Los Angeles has denied a demand for a jury trial from the attorney for an adult film actress who said she had an affair with President Trump because the request was premature.
Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Stormy Daniels, says Thursday that he will refile the motion once Trump’s attorneys formally demand an arbitration proceeding in the case.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has been seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election in order to discuss her relationship.
Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL! pic.twitter.com/pmCNoxxlkH
When a border wall replacement project began near downtown Calexico this year, Border Patrol agents emphasized that it should not be confused with President Trump’s wall. The president himself stirred up confusion Wednesday, tweeting photos of the Calexico construction and saying, “Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!”
One problem: Plans for the wall replacement project started in 2009.
“It was ultimately funded under the current administration in 2017, but is completely separate of any political talk or commentary,” Justin Castrejon, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, said in an interview this month. 
The Justice Department’s internal watchdog will examine how officials handled a secret application to conduct surveillance of a Trump foreign policy advisor, the latest review in a controversy that has set off a partisan battle in Congress and drawn angry accusations from President Trump.
Following requests from Republican senators and Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced Wednesday that his office would examine whether the FBI and Justice officials followed the law and department procedures during an investigation of Carter Page, the energy consultant whose dealings with Russians attracted scrutiny before the 2016 election.
The department obtained permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to use spying tools against Page, a U.S. citizen. Their warrant application was based in part on a now-infamous dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who was working as part of a Democrat-funded opposition research project.
President Trump waded into Orange County’s “sanctuary” laws fight with a pair of tweets Wednesday morning, one day after the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to join a federal lawsuit against California’s sanctuary laws.
My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California's Sanctuary laws....
....release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State. All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders.
Senate Bill 54, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed after the Legislature passed it last year, prohibits state and local police agencies from notifying federal officials in many cases when immigrants in their custody who may potentially be subject to deportation are about to be released.
The Trump administration went to federal court to invalidate the state laws, contending that they blatantly obstruct federal immigration law and thus violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which gives federal law precedence over state measures. That case is pending.

Of the many charges faced by Paul Manafort, conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 presidential campaign in Donald Trump’s favor isn't one of them.
But in a legal filing on Tuesday night, prosecutors working with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III dropped more hints about alleged connections between Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, and Russian intelligence. 
The information was disclosed in court papers filed in a separate case involving Alex van der Zwaan, a former lawyer who pleaded guilty in February to lying to investigators and is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday.
President Trump is too busy running the country to weigh in personally on the Stormy Daniels accusations, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Tuesday.
Aides aren’t saying whether Trump watched Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview on CBS, in which Daniels told of a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of his son, and of subsequent efforts to keep her from telling the story — including a physical threat in Trump’s name. They reiterated that Trump denies the accusations.
The president himself wasn’t saying so, however. He remained uncharacteristically silent in the wake of both Daniels’ much-watched interview and an earlier one on CNN of Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate who described a long sexual relationship with Trump in the same year.
The United States on Tuesday condemned the forced surrender of one of the last rebel-held enclaves in Syria and accused Syrian government forces of using a U.N.-backed cease-fire to accomplish it.
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, blamed Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad and playing a “central role in the bombing of Syrian civilians into submission.”
Haley, speaking at a special session of the U.N. Security Council, also lashed out at her fellow members of the organization, saying they had failed to call out Russia and Syria’s other key ally, Iran. She was reacting to reports that the enclave of eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, had all but fallen to government forces, and thousands of civilians were being forced to flee.

Five immigrants with criminal records who face possible deportation were pardoned by California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday, continuing his tradition of granting clemency around the Easter holiday.
The five individuals were among 56 pardons granted by Brown, as well as 14 sentence commutations for current inmates.
Brown’s inclusion of those at risk of deportation — which he has now done for several rounds of pardons — is yet another sign of how California has diverged on immigration from the federal government, which has increased arrests and detentions under President Trump.
Actress-turned-conservative commentator Stacey Dash is calling her congressional candidacy quits a little over a month after jumping into a Los Angeles House race. 
Dash tweeted a statement that she is “withdrawing” from the race because “the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing [sic] of my family.”
She will still appear on the June 5 primary ballot as a Republican “Actress/news analyst.”
The state attorney general has sued Sutter Health, the largest hospital system in Northern California, alleging anticompetitive business practices that unfairly drove up costs for consumers, officials announced Friday.
The lawsuit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court alleges that Sutter engaged in “anticompetitive contractual practices” and that it charged prices for hospital healthcare services that far exceed what it would have been able to charge in a competitive market.
The complaint also alleges that the excess profits received went toward extreme levels of executive compensation, purchasing other health firms and financing its own insurance arm.
Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is in stable condition Friday after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery during a procedure to replace a valve in his heart, according to his spokesman.
Two years ago this month, The Times investigated one of the longest-lingering questions in California politics: Are some voters mistakenly joining a political party when what they really want is to be an electoral free agent?
After police killed an unarmed black man in Sacramento earlier this month, California legislators are poised to again try to loosen some of the nation’s strictest prohibitions on the release of officer shooting and misconduct investigations.
Former President Obama is heading to Beverly Hills in May to raise money for Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri in his first post-presidential fundraiser for a candidate, according to an invitation obtained by The Times.
The May 6 event is co-chaired by director J.J. Abrams, studio executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Jeff Shell, sports executive Tim Leiweke, filmmaker Steven Spielberg and others.
As president, Obama appeared many times at L.A. fundraisers that raised millions of dollars for Democrats but sometimes caused traffic problems. Now that he is out of office, Obama will likely be traveling with a smaller entourage and security detail.
As the fight over California’s immigration laws intensifies, Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra on Friday released a policy guide for school officials that lays out how they can protect students from immigration enforcement on school grounds.
The guide details the steps school officials should take if federal immigration agents try to detain someone on campus, or if a child’s parents have been detained or deported. It also instructs schools on how to shield the immigration status of students and their family members, and illustrates the kinds of court records federal officials must present before entering campuses.
The policies are the result of a new state law that was part of a legislative package passed last year to safeguard immigrants here illegally from President Trump’s call for increased deportations.
Four state treasurers including California’s John Chiang requested Thursday that U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions meet with them to find a way to allow banks to handle money from the marijuana industry in states that have authorized cannabis sales.
“This is not just a blue state phenomenon but includes purple and red states in every corner of our country,” they wrote in a letter to Sessions. “A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis.”
Besides Chiang, who is running for governor, those requesting a meeting included the treasurers of Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania, as well as leaders of the marijuana industry.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is endorsing Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s bid for a fifth full term in the Senate.
“She’s tenacious. She’s accomplished. And she’s exactly who we need in the Senate to stand up to this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress. Dianne is a dear friend, and I’m proud to endorse her re-election,” Biden said Thursday in a statement provided by Feinstein’s campaign.
Biden and Feinstein served together in the Senate, and Feinstein’s assault weapons ban was included in Biden’s Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

It seems at times like a reality television show.
President Trump has ousted more than two dozen members of his administration, creating the impression of chaos and a national guessing game of who will be next.
Most of the casualties have been senior aides — remember Stephen K. Bannon and Anthony Scaramucci? Of his original Cabinet — positions that require confirmation by the Senate — a total of three have been dismissed or forced to resign. They are Tom Price (secretary of Health and Human Services), Rex Tillerson (secretary of State) and, this week, David Shulkin (secretary of Veterans Affairs).
President Trump said Thursday that he may put a hold on a new trade deal with South Korea just to make sure things are “moving along very nicely” in talks to end the nuclear program in North Korea.
The musing came in a rambling Trump speech about roads and bridges, where he broke off from the main topic repeatedly. To the surprise and confusion of many, Trump drew a possible link between the recently announced trade deal with South Korea and the joint effort by the U.S. and South Korea to enter into talks with North Korea.
The Trump administration announced this week a new trade deal that will lift steel tariffs on South Korea in exchange for greater access to their auto market, an agreement that both sides find economically advantageous. But Trump apparently thinks the deal might be valuable as a bargaining chip in the other conversation, too.
A federal judge in Los Angeles has denied a demand for a jury trial from the attorney for an adult film actress who said she had an affair with President Trump because the request was premature.
Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Stormy Daniels, says Thursday that he will refile the motion once Trump’s attorneys formally demand an arbitration proceeding in the case.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has been seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election in order to discuss her relationship.
Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL! pic.twitter.com/pmCNoxxlkH
When a border wall replacement project began near downtown Calexico this year, Border Patrol agents emphasized that it should not be confused with President Trump’s wall. The president himself stirred up confusion Wednesday, tweeting photos of the Calexico construction and saying, “Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!”
One problem: Plans for the wall replacement project started in 2009.
“It was ultimately funded under the current administration in 2017, but is completely separate of any political talk or commentary,” Justin Castrejon, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, said in an interview this month. 
The Justice Department’s internal watchdog will examine how officials handled a secret application to conduct surveillance of a Trump foreign policy advisor, the latest review in a controversy that has set off a partisan battle in Congress and drawn angry accusations from President Trump.
Following requests from Republican senators and Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced Wednesday that his office would examine whether the FBI and Justice officials followed the law and department procedures during an investigation of Carter Page, the energy consultant whose dealings with Russians attracted scrutiny before the 2016 election.
The department obtained permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to use spying tools against Page, a U.S. citizen. Their warrant application was based in part on a now-infamous dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who was working as part of a Democrat-funded opposition research project.
President Trump waded into Orange County’s “sanctuary” laws fight with a pair of tweets Wednesday morning, one day after the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to join a federal lawsuit against California’s sanctuary laws.
My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California's Sanctuary laws....
....release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State. All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders.
Senate Bill 54, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed after the Legislature passed it last year, prohibits state and local police agencies from notifying federal officials in many cases when immigrants in their custody who may potentially be subject to deportation are about to be released.
The Trump administration went to federal court to invalidate the state laws, contending that they blatantly obstruct federal immigration law and thus violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which gives federal law precedence over state measures. That case is pending.

Of the many charges faced by Paul Manafort, conspiring with Russians to influence the 2016 presidential campaign in Donald Trump’s favor isn't one of them.
But in a legal filing on Tuesday night, prosecutors working with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III dropped more hints about alleged connections between Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, and Russian intelligence. 
The information was disclosed in court papers filed in a separate case involving Alex van der Zwaan, a former lawyer who pleaded guilty in February to lying to investigators and is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday.
President Trump is too busy running the country to weigh in personally on the Stormy Daniels accusations, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Tuesday.
Aides aren’t saying whether Trump watched Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview on CBS, in which Daniels told of a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of his son, and of subsequent efforts to keep her from telling the story — including a physical threat in Trump’s name. They reiterated that Trump denies the accusations.
The president himself wasn’t saying so, however. He remained uncharacteristically silent in the wake of both Daniels’ much-watched interview and an earlier one on CNN of Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate who described a long sexual relationship with Trump in the same year.
The United States on Tuesday condemned the forced surrender of one of the last rebel-held enclaves in Syria and accused Syrian government forces of using a U.N.-backed cease-fire to accomplish it.
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, blamed Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad and playing a “central role in the bombing of Syrian civilians into submission.”
Haley, speaking at a special session of the U.N. Security Council, also lashed out at her fellow members of the organization, saying they had failed to call out Russia and Syria’s other key ally, Iran. She was reacting to reports that the enclave of eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, had all but fallen to government forces, and thousands of civilians were being forced to flee.
They’re headed for the exits in Congress, more than 50 lawmakers in all, deciding they’ve had enough and opting to quit rather than run again in November.

        ""articleBody"": ""The Trump administration&#039;s plan to ask everyone in America whether they are U.S. citizens as part of the 2020 census could cost California billions of dollars and a seat in Congress, state officials warn.Whether California and other big, urban states that face similar effects can do anything about it remains to be seen. They are rushing to court to challenge the administration&#039;s authority to tack onto the survey a question that hasn&#039;t been tested in decades.California Atty. Gen.

The Trump administration's plan to ask everyone in America whether they are U.S. citizens as part of the 2020 census could cost California billions of dollars and a seat in Congress, state officials warn.
Whether California and other big, urban states that face similar effects can do anything about it remains to be seen. They are rushing to court to challenge the administration's authority to tack onto the survey a question that hasn't been tested in decades.
California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra warned the addition of the question ""could translate into several million people not being counted."" Legal scholars say California and its allies face a tough fight.
The decision to add a single question on the census, which the administration announced late Monday night, may seem an obscure matter, but it could give the Trump administration another lever to shift power and federal resources away from blue states toward red ones, much as happened with the recent tax law changes that disproportionately favored voters in Republican regions.
The move was met with anger and protest from Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups. Sen. Dianne Feinstein called it ""designed to depress participation in certain communities"" and ""an assault on the foundations of this country.""
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the census, made the decision despite a warning from six former Census Bureau directors, who served Republicans and Democrats, that the citizenship question could undermine the credibility of the count and discourage participation.
The census, which takes place every 10 years, hasn't asked every person living in America about citizenship since 1950. That's in large part because of concern that asking the question would discourage not just noncitizens, but also their families from participating.
The result of adding the question could be a significant undercount of the population in states with large numbers of immigrants, such as California. Most of those states have Democratic majorities. Although some Republican states, such as Texas, have large immigrant populations and could be hurt by an undercount, most majority-Republican states have relatively fewer immigrants than the rest of the nation.
The main purpose of the $12.5-billion census effort is to get an accurate count of population for divvying up House seats among the states. The count also drives how the government distributes money from some of its biggest programs, such as Medicaid.
The Constitution provides for an ""actual enumeration"" of population every 10 years and provides that ""Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state.""
That clause has been interpreted throughout U.S. history as referring to a state's entire population, including both citizens and noncitizens, although some conservatives in recent years have challenged that.
California filed its suit immediately.
""The state of California, in particular, stands to lose if the citizenship question is included,"" said the complaint filed by Becerra late Monday in federal district court in San Francisco.
""Undercounting the sizable number of Californian noncitizens and their citizen relatives will imperil the State's fair share of congressional seats and Electoral College electors and will cost the state billions of dollars in federal funding over the next decade.""
""It is long settled that all persons residing in the United States — citizens and noncitizens alike — must be counted to fulfill the Constitution's 'actual Enumeration' mandate,"" the complaint said.
The state's prospects for success could hinge not on the broad constitutional question, but on whether courts agree that the new question was added so haphazardly that it threatens to undermine the entire count, legal experts said.
""It is unprecedented to include a major change in the census this close to when the forms are going to go out,"" said Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford law professor and census scholar. The question would not get the years of vetting that typically go into the survey, he said.
""This is a pretty radical change at a pretty late date,"" he added.
Kenneth Prewitt, who ran the Census Bureau from 1998 to 2001 and now teaches at Columbia University, agreed.
""We have all kinds of agreements and law about pre-testing questions and submitting them for public comment,"" he said. ""This is just being added without all that.""
Making the case that the question is fundamentally unconstitutional, by contrast, could be tough. UC Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said the state will be hard pressed to prove a citizenship question makes an accurate count of all people in the country impossible.
Trump's Department of Justice had asked to have the citizenship question included, saying the information was critical to its enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The agency said the information was needed to get an accurate tally of the voting populations in regions where violations of the law were alleged.
Democrats challenged that rationale.
""Asking the citizenship question on the census is not critical to enforcing the Voting Rights Act,"" former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. ""Make no mistake — this decision is motivated purely by politics.
Ross wrote in a letter to his agency Monday that adding the question would enable the federal government to get more accurate data, ""which is of greater importance than any adverse effect that may result from people violating their legal duty to respond.""
He added that there was no ""definitive, empirical support"" for the belief that asking about citizenship would discourage people from responding to the census.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters – inaccurately – that the citizenship question had been part of every census since 1965 and only got removed in the last survey, during the Obama administration. While citizenship questions have been included in other Census Bureau surveys since 1950, they have not been in the full census.
If the question does lead to an undercount, the effects could be profound. The census is used to allocate nearly $700 billion in federal money. As many as 16 states are positioned to either lose or gain a congressional seat, depending on the census results. California could lose even more than one seat if all the immigrants in the state illegally were to opt out of the census.
California has 53 seats in the House, the largest delegation of any state. But it is already at risk of losing one of them to states whose populations have grown faster over the last decade.
The census results also factor into how political districts are drawn within California. The state's population is already one of the most difficult to count, according to the Public Policy institute of California. About 75% of Californians belong to groups that the census historically has undercounted, including Latinos, African Americans and renters.
As lawmakers battled over the Trump administration plan and lawsuits were filed, longtime stewards of the census were disheartened to see the count suddenly engulfed by so much partisanship.
""It has always been above that kind of polarization,"" said Prewitt. ""I worry the census will suffer long-term damage.""

There was plenty of outrage to go around last week after revelations that Facebook data on some 50 million users were used to allegedly build profiles of voters, serve them tailor-made ads and try to help Donald Trump get elected.
While the backlash was fierce against Cambridge Analytica, the firm accused of deploying the ill-gotten data, some of the discussion missed the point. The trove of data on which the firm relied, providing such information as a user's relationship status and their education history, is increasingly being used by political campaigns and candidates to target voters.
Most people are familiar with this phenomenon: You browse the web for a pair of sneakers and suddenly the shoes are following you as you read the news or scroll through social media. It might take days or weeks for you to shake the ads.
Picture that, but with  Trump's or Nancy Pelosi's face following you around, and you'll get an idea of what digital advertising will look like as we head into prime midterm election season. Political advertisers are expected to spend a record $1.8 billion on digital ads this year, up from $1.4 billion in 2016.
Facebook users — 68% of American adults — volunteer their age, hometown and jobs, whether they have kids, where they vacation, whether they like ""Duck Dynasty"" or ""Will and Grace,"" or asked for updates from a local Indivisible chapter or the local Republican Party. As you browse the internet, third-party data trackers can follow your internet activity and add other bits of data to compile a substantial dossier on each person.
""They know what your IP address is, the keywords you've used, other sites you've gone to. If you go to Fox News a lot, they know,"" said Gordon Borrell of Borrell Associates, a firm that tracks advertising data​​​​.
While data trackers make a lot of the information about your digital activity somewhat anonymous to protect privacy, the information can still be used by digital ad firms to match you with an IP address or social media profile.
Want to reach only 50- to 65-year-old women who are independents, comment on liberal Facebook groups and are interested in environmental causes? That's easy. Want to show a candidate video to likely Republican voters in their 30s who are parents of school-age kids and own a home? Campaigns can do that, too.
If a campaign wants to use digital targeting, there are a few options.
The more DIY-minded might craft a message for specific potential voters in their races, and then use Facebook's powerful targeting features to find those voters, searching by geography, interests, age, gender and political leanings.

Track the California races that could flip the House »
Clues to your political leanings could be what types of news stories you post, whether you have an SUV or an electric car registered in your name, and what other smartphone apps you use — all data that Facebook makes available to advertisers.
To pursue more sophisticated methods, campaigns pay data firms, including those that track people's voting records and party registration, credit scores, shopping data, home ownership and other factors to narrow down which voters they want to target.
Once they have a list, campaigns can upload it to Facebook or other social media to match voters with their profiles, which help the data firms determine how best to reach them.
Bob Huff, a Republican California House candidate who paid Cambridge Analytica during his unsuccessful campaign for the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors, told the San Jose Mercury News that he targeted people who were predicted to be off-road vehicle enthusiasts to tell them about his record of supporting off-road vehicles.
Using a smartphone's GPS information, digital ad and data firms can even flag people's locations to show them relevant ads later. Someone who drives over a major bridge could get ads on their phone later about rising tolls. Or a fan who goes to a baseball stadium could be served with ads from a group supporting a bond measure to help build a new one.
In one extreme example of the practice, known as ""geo-fencing,"" anti-abortion groups sent ads to women who visited Planned Parenthood clinics across the country.
With so many people accessing social media on multiple devices, campaigns can easily identify the unique device IDs for the smartphones, tablets and laptops people use to reach them multiple times a day.
During the 2014 midterm elections, political campaigns and groups spent less than 1% of their ad budgets online. In 2018, the share is expected to be more than 22%, according to Borrell Associates, a firm that tracks advertising data.
Many of those digital ads will hit California, where political advertisers are expected to spend the most this year by far.
Campaigns are always looking for smarter ways to spend their precious dollars, and digital advertising is much less expensive than traditional TV, radio and mail ads.
Additionally, the amount of digital data associated with a person helps campaigns tailor their messages, and metrics help them see whether a person clicks a link in the ad or watches an entire campaign video.
""It's so cheap, and it gives you so much more feedback than a piece of mail ever could,"" said Matt Shupe, a GOP consultant who helped manage Facebook ads for the last Republican National Convention. ""It gives you the opportunity to optimize and refine a message.""
Especially early in the campaign season, before voters are bombarded by TV ads, digital ads can help campaigns identify supporters, add them to mailing lists and encourage them to donate or volunteer.
There are plenty of people worrying about the effect of so many political digital ads and the data collection that makes them possible.
Among the concerns is that targeting could distort reality for voters. If a campaign knows, for example, that a certain group of voters doesn't respond well to negative ads, it could show them only positive ones while it continues to run attack ads elsewhere.
Privacy groups have pushed for stricter controls on data collection by Facebook and other companies for years, and the most recent controversy even prompted Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to suggest he'd be open to more regulation of his company.
Despite backlash over political ads, Facebook's role in elections will only grow »
If you're concerned about your digital activity being used for political ads, here are some things you can try:
• Since Cambridge Analytica's practices were highlighted, a campaign urging users to delete their Facebook accounts has popped up. You can do that, or you can take other steps to minimize what Facebook knows about you, like lying about your personal details.
• Use ad blockers or other apps that block third-party trackers, which keep records of your behavior across the internet.
• Browse in Google Chrome's incognito mode or use a virtual private network connection to increase privacy.
• Read campaign privacy policies before signing up for newsletters, visiting their websites or donating money.
• Think twice if you're asked to connect with a political group, app or mailing list by logging into your Facebook account.
• If a campaign volunteer who knocks on your door is carrying a tablet, ask what data are being collected and why.

The state attorney general has sued Sutter Health, the largest hospital system in Northern California, alleging anticompetitive business practices that unfairly drove up costs for consumers, officials announced Friday.
The lawsuit filed in San Francisco County Superior Court alleges that Sutter engaged in “anticompetitive contractual practices” and that it charged prices for hospital healthcare services that far exceed what it would have been able to charge in a competitive market.
The complaint also alleges that the excess profits received went toward extreme levels of executive compensation, purchasing other health firms and financing its own insurance arm.
Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is in stable condition Friday after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery during a procedure to replace a valve in his heart, according to his spokesman.
Two years ago this month, The Times investigated one of the longest-lingering questions in California politics: Are some voters mistakenly joining a political party when what they really want is to be an electoral free agent?
After police killed an unarmed black man in Sacramento earlier this month, California legislators are poised to again try to loosen some of the nation’s strictest prohibitions on the release of officer shooting and misconduct investigations.
Former President Obama is heading to Beverly Hills in May to raise money for Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri in his first post-presidential fundraiser for a candidate, according to an invitation obtained by The Times.
The May 6 event is co-chaired by director J.J. Abrams, studio executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Jeff Shell, sports executive Tim Leiweke, filmmaker Steven Spielberg and others.
As president, Obama appeared many times at L.A. fundraisers that raised millions of dollars for Democrats but sometimes caused traffic problems. Now that he is out of office, Obama will likely be traveling with a smaller entourage and security detail.
As the fight over California’s immigration laws intensifies, Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra on Friday released a policy guide for school officials that lays out how they can protect students from immigration enforcement on school grounds.
The guide details the steps school officials should take if federal immigration agents try to detain someone on campus, or if a child’s parents have been detained or deported. It also instructs schools on how to shield the immigration status of students and their family members, and illustrates the kinds of court records federal officials must present before entering campuses.
The policies are the result of a new state law that was part of a legislative package passed last year to safeguard immigrants here illegally from President Trump’s call for increased deportations.
Four state treasurers including California’s John Chiang requested Thursday that U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions meet with them to find a way to allow banks to handle money from the marijuana industry in states that have authorized cannabis sales.
“This is not just a blue state phenomenon but includes purple and red states in every corner of our country,” they wrote in a letter to Sessions. “A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis.”
Besides Chiang, who is running for governor, those requesting a meeting included the treasurers of Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania, as well as leaders of the marijuana industry.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is endorsing Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s bid for a fifth full term in the Senate.
“She’s tenacious. She’s accomplished. And she’s exactly who we need in the Senate to stand up to this Administration and its Republican allies in Congress. Dianne is a dear friend, and I’m proud to endorse her re-election,” Biden said Thursday in a statement provided by Feinstein’s campaign.
Biden and Feinstein served together in the Senate, and Feinstein’s assault weapons ban was included in Biden’s Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
It’s not typical for a congressman to show up in person at a Board of Supervisors meeting. But that’s exactly what happened Wednesday, when Rep. Dana Rohrabacher spoke on a controversial matter the board was taking up Tuesday in Orange County: whether to join the Trump administration in suing California for its “sanctuary state” law.
“By making this a sanctuary city and a sanctuary state, we are doing nothing more than attracting millions of more people to come to this country,” Rohrabacher told the board. He added that a “flow of illegals” has diminished the quality of public schools, healthcare and housing for Californians. He also called immigrants in the country illegally “the greatest threat to the well-being” of county residents.
Rohrabacher’s words aren’t far off from talking points crafted more than a quarter-century ago during the campaign for Prop. 187, a ballot initiative that got its start in his coastal Orange County district and called for eliminating basic services such as healthcare and public schooling for immigrants in the country illegally. It passed, and helped propel Gov. Pete Wilson to the governorship, but was later struck down by the courts. It’s also received the brunt of the blame for the steep decline of the California Republican Party over the past couple decades.
Those young people who marched for gun control all over the country showed this: The unyielding firearms lobby is in deep trouble with the next generation.

Five immigrants with criminal records who face possible deportation were pardoned by California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday, continuing his tradition of granting clemency around the Easter holiday.
The five individuals were among 56 pardons granted by Brown, as well as 14 sentence commutations for current inmates.
Brown’s inclusion of those at risk of deportation — which he has now done for several rounds of pardons — is yet another sign of how California has diverged on immigration from the federal government, which has increased arrests and detentions under President Trump.
Actress-turned-conservative commentator Stacey Dash is calling her congressional candidacy quits a little over a month after jumping into a Los Angeles House race. 
Dash tweeted a statement that she is “withdrawing” from the race because “the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing [sic] of my family.”
She will still appear on the June 5 primary ballot as a Republican “Actress/news analyst.”

It seems at times like a reality television show.
President Trump has ousted more than two dozen members of his administration, creating the impression of chaos and a national guessing game of who will be next.
Most of the casualties have been senior aides — remember Stephen K. Bannon and Anthony Scaramucci? Of his original Cabinet — positions that require confirmation by the Senate — a total of three have been dismissed or forced to resign. They are Tom Price (secretary of Health and Human Services), Rex Tillerson (secretary of State) and, this week, David Shulkin (secretary of Veterans Affairs).
But in Trump’s orbit, few people are safe. Here’s a look at some key officials and why they might stay or go:
Why he might stay: Carson is a loyalist, and we all know that Trump favors those. Shortly after Carson dropped out of the 2016 presidential race, he tossed his support to Trump and tried to help him make inroads with black and Latino voters. He’s also the lone African American with a high-level position in the Trump administration and has defended the president on racial issues. In August, when Trump said “both sides” were to blame for violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., Carson said the ensuing criticism was “blown out of proportion.”
Why he might go: He’s been relatively quiet since Trump took office, but in recent weeks that has changed. Carson’s wife bought a dining room set for his office that cost the Department of Housing and Urban Development $31,000. Speaking before a House committee this month, Carson addressed the purchase, saying he’s “not really big into decorating.”
“If it was up to me, my office would probably look like a hospital waiting room,” the former neurosurgeon said.
The furniture order has since been canceled.
Why she might stay: In recent weeks, Trump has shown confidence in DeVos as the two have been in lockstep on a controversial issue: whether to arm teachers. Since the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., both have staunchly supported the idea. This month, Trump tapped DeVos to head a school safety commission that will craft measures to keep students safe and explore how to prevent mass shootings.
Why she might go: Bad ratings. She’s often greeted by protesters — primarily teachers unions — because of her support for charter schools, which are publicly funded and set up by teachers, parents, or community groups, outside the state school system. She was also widely ridiculed for a “60 Minutes” interview in which she gave vague answers on school choice, sexual assault on college campuses and other issues.
Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist, who served as a senior advisor on John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, described the interview in one word: “Bad.”
“She humiliated herself and the administration,” he said. “That’s what Trump hates most — humiliation. But, for now, she remains.”
Why he might stay: He’s a retired four-star general, and Trump has said he likes generals. Since he became chief of staff in July, Kelly has sought to bring order to the West Wing, something at the time Trump reportedly said was much needed. In public, at least, Trump says he likes Kelly.
Why he might go: In private, however, it’s been reported that Trump is souring on Kelly. In recent weeks, Trump has complained the management structure in the West Wing doesn't suit the freewheeling style he employed as a businessman, according to several news outlets. Kelly made negative headlines recently when he acknowledged he mishandled accusations of domestic abuse that were made by ex-wives of Rob Porter, who resigned in February from his job as White House staff secretary.
Why he might stay: He’s a general. And for the most part, Trump has avoided confrontation with Mattis and stayed out his way at the Pentagon. The president has also made concessions at the request of Mattis. Last week, Trump signed a spending bill after threatening a veto. Mattis had been vocal in his support for the bill because it boosts Pentagon funding.
Mattis is a “towering figure that is indispensable to this administration and country,” said Schmidt, the Republican strategist.
“If he goes, it’s not good for the safety of our country,” he said. “He keeps Trump in line.”
Why he might go: His allies are leaving the administration. In recent weeks, it’s been announced that both Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster will be relieved of their duties as secretary of State and national security advisor, respectively. Mattis has also publicly split with the president on issues such as North Korea and Iran. If he becomes more vocal, that could lead to his departure as well.
Why he might stay: Mnuchin is a New Yorker and he’s rich — two things he shares with Trump. Mnuchin has also defended the president’s policies relentlessly. At a gathering of global economic leaders this month, Mnuchin faced a barrage of questions about Trump’s plan to hit other countries with stiff tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and never backed down. He said the administration was prepared for a trade war.
“We’re not afraid of it,” Mnuchin said at the Group of 20 finance ministers’ meeting in Argentina. “This administration is going to make sure that we’re treated fairly.”
Why he might go: He’s been in the news for all the wrong reasons.
Last summer, Mnuchin took a military jet from New York to Washington, saying he needed a secure phone line. The Aug. 15 flight cost at least $25,000, ABC News reported. Mnuchin and his wife also drew criticism for flying on a government plane to Kentucky, where they viewed the solar eclipse. Treasury officials defended the visit as official travel — Mnuchin attended a luncheon and visited the gold vault at Ft. Knox — and said he would reimburse the government for his wife's costs.
Why she might stay: Huckabee Sanders is a staunch defender of the president. She is willing to battle reporters on issues such as the Russia investigation and Trump’s alleged affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Unlike her predecessor, Sean Spicer, she has avoided drawing ire from her boss.
Why she might go: It’s simple: Trump is his own spokesperson. At any moment, he could become upset with her performance and she’ll be out.
Why he might stay: If Trump fires Sessions, it could open a legal morass. It’s been reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, is looking into whether Trump tried to pressure Sessions to resign and whether that could be part of an obstruction of justice case.
In addition, firing Sessions could ignite a strong response in Congress, where many Republicans are still very supportive of the former senator from Alabama. He’s also been willing to implement some of Trump’s most controversial policies, including a travel ban targeting nationals of several majority-Muslim countries.
Why he might go: Since Sessions recused himself from the Russia inquiry last year, Trump has assailed him relentlessly.
“So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?” Trump tweeted last summer.
At some point the humiliation “may just be too much to overcome,” Schmidt said. Sessions “might leave on his own … you would think that might have happened months ago.”
Why he might stay: He is another Trump loyalist. The former congressman from Montana was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential bid. And he’s the point man for Trump’s widely touted plan to expand offshore drilling, including along the Gulf Coast and the California coast. In January, Zinke and Trump released a proposal to open for exploration the largest expanse of the nation’s offshore oil and natural gas reserves ever offered to global energy companies.
Why he might go: Zinke has amassed bad headlines. In October, the Office of Inspector General launched an investigation after news reports revealed that Zinke chartered a $12,375 flight from Las Vegas to an airport near his home in Montana, where he spent the night.

        ""articleBody"": ""Former Sacramento Kings player Matt Barnes led hundreds of demonstrators in a peaceful rally in downtown Sacramento on Saturday to protest the police killing of Stephon Clark, one day after an independent autopsy concluded that the unarmed black man was shot six times in the back.&#034;It&#039;s more than color. It&#039;s about wrong and right,&#034; Barnes told the crowd gathered in Cesar E. Chavez Plaza in what was a largely motivational rally. He called for police to get out of their cars and walk the neighborhoods they patrol, to reduce their fears and the likelihood of using excessive force.&#034;Learn the community that you&#039;re out here patrolling,&#034; said Barnes, a Sacramento native who retired from the NBA this season. The Rev. Shane Harris of the National Action Network and members of the Clark family also attended.Holding Clark&#039;s two sons, ages 3 and 1, aloft, Harris and Barnes announced a college scholarship fund.It is intended &#034;to make sure these boys go to college,&#034; Barnes said, &#034;but like we mentioned earlier, this is not a Sacramento problem, this is a nationwide problem, so once we get [the scholarship fund] up we are going to carry it nationwide to provide kids who have lost their fathers with stuff like this a chance to become productive men.&#034;Barnes, a former Laker, said that he has 9-year-old twin sons and that Clark had two young sons and so he wanted to do his part to support his community and to talk about the escalating tensions with police. Saturday&#039;s event was called Rally for Unity and Action.&#034;People fear what they don&#039;t know,&#034; said Barnes, who attended Clark&#039;s funeral on Thursday. &#034;We don&#039;t know these cops, so we fear them. They don&#039;t know us, so they fear us.&#034;Members of Clark&#039;s extended family also appeared at the rally, and a few of them spoke, giving voice to their grief and continued shock.&#034;Nothing seems to change,&#034; said Curtis Gordon, Clark&#039;s uncle, speaking without a script. This &#034;situation seems to happen quite often, that someone who looks like me isn&#039;t going to go home. You really can&#039;t internalize that unless you live it.&#034;He noted that those in the park rally included people who fought the same civil rights battles generations before, &#034;when my mother was young, when her mother was young. You really don&#039;t know the pain we are going through here.&#034;He called out police &#034;who look at us like something is wrong with us,&#034; and made a plea for love, and recognition that &#034;we are all from the human race.&#034;Gordon also raised questions about police training, noting that officers are trained to decide when to shoot and when to stand down. The officers who shot his unarmed nephew &#034;must become accountable. You must own your responsibility.&#034;Clark&#039;s aunt, Jamilia Land, rose to the defense of Clark&#039;s brother, Stevante, who has been a visible if not sometimes disruptive presence at public rallies and a City Council meeting, demanding attention to his brother&#039;s death.&#034;You don&#039;t know the damage inside,&#034; Land said. &#034;We are living in communities that look like war zones. You don&#039;t know what it is like to go to the home that you grew up in and hear from the ones you love that your brother was murdered in his grandmother&#039;s backyard. You don&#039;t know the pain that his grandfather feels for hearing him knock on the window for help!&#034;Family members have consistently said that it was their practice to keep the front door locked, and to rap on a back window to ask those inside the house to open a side door. Police video shows Clark was near that back window when police opened fire on him.Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg issued a statement urging the community to work together through nonviolent civil action &#034;as we pursue justice and demand reform.&#034;&#034;We have an obligation to everyone involved, including the family of Stephon Clark, to wait for the full findings and results from the official autopsy and investigation,&#034; Steinberg said. &#034;As the mayor of our city, I assure the community and the public that we will aggressively seek answers to all of the questions the community is rightfully asking. As important, we will aggressively seek appropriate change to the protocols and training that led to this unacceptable outcome.&#034;Saturday&#039;s rally also drew campaign workers for Democrat Noah Phillips, who is challenging Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert in the June election. Schubert must decide whether to prosecute the two officers involved in Clark&#039;s killing.Schubert decided last year against charging two other officers who fatally shot another black resident, Joseph Mann, a mentally ill man whom the officers had earlier tried to run down with their patrol car.&#034;If we don&#039;t prosecute and we continue to allow this to go by the wayside … I am struggling to find the words, but by opening this door we could eliminate so many problems,&#034; said Phillips campaign supporter Allan Leri. &#034;There&#039;s only one person who can hold persons accountable in certain situations.&#034;Derrell Roberts, a local activist who runs a youth mentoring program in South Sacramento, said people need to be patient until the Police Department and other agencies complete their investigations into the Clark shooting.&#034;We expect that to take more time than we will be happy with,&#034; he said. &#034;But it&#039;s part of the process we have to go through.&#034;He said the community feels &#034;that police over-police our neighborhood, thus causing confrontations that lead to the death of a young black man in this case, or in the case of Joseph Mann, or nationally the killing of Tamir Rice, or the killing of Treyvon Martin. All of that is a result of over-policing, or people feeling they need to over-police the communities we live and work in.&#034;Hours before the noon rally, hundreds of protesters took to the streets late Friday and early Saturday morning.The demonstration moved through the downtown area and was generally peaceful. At one point, the group appeared headed toward Interstate 5, which marchers had blocked in an earlier protest, but did not enter the highway.It was the latest of numerous demonstrations in support of Clark.Dr. Bennet Omalu conducted an autopsy days after Clark was killed by police on March 18. He told reporters Friday that his examination showed that Clark was hit by eight bullets, and all but one entered while his back was turned toward the two officers who fired at him.Another standoff between #StephonClark demonstrators and CHP officers in front of Interstate 5 pic.twitter.com/qthhgVeuwB&amp;mdash; Tom Miller (@KCRAMiller) March 31, 2018

One bullet entered Clark&#039;s left thigh from the front and was probably fired while he was on the ground and had already been shot multiple times, Omalu said.The independent autopsy finding raises new questions about Clark&#039;s shooting, which is now the subject of investigations by both local and state officials. The county coroner&#039;s official autopsy results are not expected for several weeks.Clark, 22, was fatally shot in his grandmother&#039;s backyard by police looking for a vandal in the neighborhood. More than 20 shots were fired. Clark was found with a cellphone. No weapon was recovered.Sacramento authorities did not immediately comment on the autopsy results. Police have released videos showing the incident but have urged the public not to pass judgment on officers until the investigation is complete.Among the unanswered questions that have fueled anger in the wake of Clark&#039;s shooting is why officers muted their body cameras after firing 20 shots at the unarmed black man.After the shooting, a police sergeant arrived on the scene and appeared to take charge. He asked the two officers how many shots were fired and in what direction. He brought the officers to the street and is heard saying, &#034;Hey, must&#034; as he reached for his body camera.The audio of both of the officers standing with him went silent.Betty Williams, president of the Sacramento branch of the NAACP, said Saturday that her organization is pushing for law enforcement reforms because of the Clark shooting. She said it wants legislation that would automatically require the state attorney general&#039;s office to provide oversight or conduct its own investigation of such controversial police shootings.In addition, she said, the organization wants new protocols for muting police audio recordings.&#034;If you&#039;re looking for accountability and full transparency, keep it on the entire time,&#034; she said. &#034;Even if you&#039;re discussing your children&#039;s birthday party. It doesn&#039;t matter. Leave it on.&#034;The shooting has sparked days of protests in the state capital and made national headlines.Clark was buried after a funeral Thursday attended by hundreds of mourners, including the Rev. Al Sharpton.Steinberg has called Clark&#039;s death &#034;wrong,&#034; but said he cannot pass judgment on the officers&#039; actions until the investigation is complete.On Wednesday, a police spokesman said Clark remained the sole suspect in break-ins of vehicles and what a sheriff&#039;s deputy said was the attempted break-in of a home. It was a call about those incidents that sent police to the neighborhood the night Clark was shot.A Sacramento County Sheriff&#039;s Department helicopter spotted a man in a backyard and directed police toward him, authorities said. Deputies told officers that the man had picked up a &#034;toolbar&#034; and broken the window of a home.The man was seen running south, toward the front of the house, where he stopped and looked into another car, police said. Police body camera footage shows that officers intercepted Clark in the backyard of his grandmother&#039;s house, and one of them yelled, &#034;Gun!&#034; as he turned a corner and saw Clark. The officer ducked back momentarily, then looked around the corner again and, shouting &#034;Gun! Gun! Gun!&#034; began firing rapidly. His partner then joined in the shooting.The officers told other police who arrived on the scene they thought Clark was pointing something at them. &#034;It looked like a gun from our perspective,&#034; one said.The object found when they rolled over Clark&#039;s bleeding body was a white cellphone.Clark was pronounced dead at the scene. Police video shows that several minutes passed until officers approached Clark&#039;s body. They then handcuffed him before appearing to attempt resuscitation.St. John reported from Sacramento, Serna and Winton from Los Angeles.To read this article in Spanish click hereUPDATES:3:35 p.m.: This article was updated with more comments from rally participants.2:20 p.m.: This article was updated with more comments from rally participants.1:15 p.m.: This article was updated with additional comments from rally participants.12:40 p.m.: This article was updated with new details from Saturday&#039;s rally and comments from Mayor Darrell Steinberg.11:50 a.m.: This article was updated with comments from former Sacramento Kings player Matt Barnes.9:10 a.m.: This article was updated with information about a rally scheduled for Saturday.This article was originally posted at 7:45 a.m."",

Former Sacramento Kings player Matt Barnes led hundreds of demonstrators in a peaceful rally in downtown Sacramento on Saturday to protest the police killing of Stephon Clark, one day after an independent autopsy concluded that the unarmed black man was shot six times in the back.
""It's more than color. It's about wrong and right,"" Barnes told the crowd gathered in Cesar E. Chavez Plaza in what was a largely motivational rally. He called for police to get out of their cars and walk the neighborhoods they patrol, to reduce their fears and the likelihood of using excessive force.
""Learn the community that you're out here patrolling,"" said Barnes, a Sacramento native who retired from the NBA this season. The Rev. Shane Harris of the National Action Network and members of the Clark family also attended.
Holding Clark's two sons, ages 3 and 1, aloft, Harris and Barnes announced a college scholarship fund.
It is intended ""to make sure these boys go to college,"" Barnes said, ""but like we mentioned earlier, this is not a Sacramento problem, this is a nationwide problem, so once we get [the scholarship fund] up we are going to carry it nationwide to provide kids who have lost their fathers with stuff like this a chance to become productive men.""
Barnes, a former Laker, said that he has 9-year-old twin sons and that Clark had two young sons and so he wanted to do his part to support his community and to talk about the escalating tensions with police. Saturday's event was called Rally for Unity and Action.
""People fear what they don't know,"" said Barnes, who attended Clark's funeral on Thursday. ""We don't know these cops, so we fear them. They don't know us, so they fear us.""
Members of Clark's extended family also appeared at the rally, and a few of them spoke, giving voice to their grief and continued shock.
""Nothing seems to change,"" said Curtis Gordon, Clark's uncle, speaking without a script. This ""situation seems to happen quite often, that someone who looks like me isn't going to go home. You really can't internalize that unless you live it.""
He noted that those in the park rally included people who fought the same civil rights battles generations before, ""when my mother was young, when her mother was young. You really don't know the pain we are going through here.""
He called out police ""who look at us like something is wrong with us,"" and made a plea for love, and recognition that ""we are all from the human race.""
Gordon also raised questions about police training, noting that officers are trained to decide when to shoot and when to stand down. The officers who shot his unarmed nephew ""must become accountable. You must own your responsibility.""
Clark's aunt, Jamilia Land, rose to the defense of Clark's brother, Stevante, who has been a visible if not sometimes disruptive presence at public rallies and a City Council meeting, demanding attention to his brother's death.
""You don't know the damage inside,"" Land said. ""We are living in communities that look like war zones. You don't know what it is like to go to the home that you grew up in and hear from the ones you love that your brother was murdered in his grandmother's backyard. You don't know the pain that his grandfather feels for hearing him knock on the window for help!""
Family members have consistently said that it was their practice to keep the front door locked, and to rap on a back window to ask those inside the house to open a side door. Police video shows Clark was near that back window when police opened fire on him.
Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg issued a statement urging the community to work together through nonviolent civil action ""as we pursue justice and demand reform.""
""We have an obligation to everyone involved, including the family of Stephon Clark, to wait for the full findings and results from the official autopsy and investigation,"" Steinberg said. ""As the mayor of our city, I assure the community and the public that we will aggressively seek answers to all of the questions the community is rightfully asking. As important, we will aggressively seek appropriate change to the protocols and training that led to this unacceptable outcome.""
Saturday's rally also drew campaign workers for Democrat Noah Phillips, who is challenging Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert in the June election. Schubert must decide whether to prosecute the two officers involved in Clark's killing.
Schubert decided last year against charging two other officers who fatally shot another black resident, Joseph Mann, a mentally ill man whom the officers had earlier tried to run down with their patrol car.
""If we don't prosecute and we continue to allow this to go by the wayside … I am struggling to find the words, but by opening this door we could eliminate so many problems,"" said Phillips campaign supporter Allan Leri. ""There's only one person who can hold persons accountable in certain situations.""
Derrell Roberts, a local activist who runs a youth mentoring program in South Sacramento, said people need to be patient until the Police Department and other agencies complete their investigations into the Clark shooting.
""We expect that to take more time than we will be happy with,"" he said. ""But it's part of the process we have to go through.""
He said the community feels ""that police over-police our neighborhood, thus causing confrontations that lead to the death of a young black man in this case, or in the case of Joseph Mann, or nationally the killing of Tamir Rice, or the killing of Treyvon Martin. All of that is a result of over-policing, or people feeling they need to over-police the communities we live and work in.""
Hours before the noon rally, hundreds of protesters took to the streets late Friday and early Saturday morning.
The demonstration moved through the downtown area and was generally peaceful. At one point, the group appeared headed toward Interstate 5, which marchers had blocked in an earlier protest, but did not enter the highway.
It was the latest of numerous demonstrations in support of Clark.
Dr. Bennet Omalu conducted an autopsy days after Clark was killed by police on March 18. He told reporters Friday that his examination showed that Clark was hit by eight bullets, and all but one entered while his back was turned toward the two officers who fired at him.

One bullet entered Clark's left thigh from the front and was probably fired while he was on the ground and had already been shot multiple times, Omalu said.
The independent autopsy finding raises new questions about Clark's shooting, which is now the subject of investigations by both local and state officials. The county coroner's official autopsy results are not expected for several weeks.
Clark, 22, was fatally shot in his grandmother's backyard by police looking for a vandal in the neighborhood. More than 20 shots were fired. Clark was found with a cellphone. No weapon was recovered.
Sacramento authorities did not immediately comment on the autopsy results. Police have released videos showing the incident but have urged the public not to pass judgment on officers until the investigation is complete.
Among the unanswered questions that have fueled anger in the wake of Clark's shooting is why officers muted their body cameras after firing 20 shots at the unarmed black man.
After the shooting, a police sergeant arrived on the scene and appeared to take charge. He asked the two officers how many shots were fired and in what direction. He brought the officers to the street and is heard saying, ""Hey, must"" as he reached for his body camera.
The audio of both of the officers standing with him went silent.
Betty Williams, president of the Sacramento branch of the NAACP, said Saturday that her organization is pushing for law enforcement reforms because of the Clark shooting. She said it wants legislation that would automatically require the state attorney general's office to provide oversight or conduct its own investigation of such controversial police shootings.
In addition, she said, the organization wants new protocols for muting police audio recordings.
""If you're looking for accountability and full transparency, keep it on the entire time,"" she said. ""Even if you're discussing your children's birthday party. It doesn't matter. Leave it on.""
The shooting has sparked days of protests in the state capital and made national headlines.
Clark was buried after a funeral Thursday attended by hundreds of mourners, including the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Steinberg has called Clark's death ""wrong,"" but said he cannot pass judgment on the officers' actions until the investigation is complete.
On Wednesday, a police spokesman said Clark remained the sole suspect in break-ins of vehicles and what a sheriff's deputy said was the attempted break-in of a home. It was a call about those incidents that sent police to the neighborhood the night Clark was shot.
A Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter spotted a man in a backyard and directed police toward him, authorities said. Deputies told officers that the man had picked up a ""toolbar"" and broken the window of a home.
The man was seen running south, toward the front of the house, where he stopped and looked into another car, police said. Police body camera footage shows that officers intercepted Clark in the backyard of his grandmother's house, and one of them yelled, ""Gun!"" as he turned a corner and saw Clark. The officer ducked back momentarily, then looked around the corner again and, shouting ""Gun! Gun! Gun!"" began firing rapidly. His partner then joined in the shooting.
The officers told other police who arrived on the scene they thought Clark was pointing something at them. ""It looked like a gun from our perspective,"" one said.
The object found when they rolled over Clark's bleeding body was a white cellphone.
Clark was pronounced dead at the scene. Police video shows that several minutes passed until officers approached Clark's body. They then handcuffed him before appearing to attempt resuscitation.
St. John reported from Sacramento, Serna and Winton from Los Angeles.

Archbishop Jose H. Gomez presided over the annual Blessing of the Animals ceremony Saturday in downtown Los Angeles, an Olvera Street tradition that dates back to 1930.
The event, held in anticipation of Easter vigil Mass, got underway at 2 p.m. in the plaza in front of Pico House. Dozens of Angelenos brought their dogs, cats, sheep, cows, horses, birds, pigs and other animals.
The ritual dates to the 4th century, when saints began to bless animals for the services, comfort and companionship they provide humans. Saturday's blessing lasted about an hour.
An Easter vigil Mass was scheduled for 8 p.m. at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels downtown.
On Sunday, the archbishop will celebrate Easter Mass in English beginning at 10 a.m. at the cathedral. Father David Gallardo will celebrate the Mass in Spanish at 1 p.m.
""Easter is a great day filled with hope and joy for us,"" Gomez said in a statement. ""Christ is risen and we know we will rise with him! Easter tells us that God's love is stronger than death. And that Jesus is on our side.""

Jesus Aceves was driving three of his fellow farmworkers to the tomato fields in the early-morning darkness when he saw lights flash behind him.
ICE agents pulled him over and asked for his license, registration and insurance and, most forebodingly, whether the men were in the United States legally.
Aceves and his passengers were taken to an immigrant detention facility. But none of them had been the target of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Three of the men had no criminal records. The most serious blots on the 44-year-old Aceves’ record were several convictions — the most recent in 2012 — for driving without a license.
That morning, an ICE spokesman said, agents went to a Kern County residence where they thought an immigration target lived. One of the men who got into Aceves’ car matched that person’s description, he said. The ICE agents followed.
The arrests were part of a larger sweep in California’s agricultural heartland that has sent fear through the Central Valley, where for generations, immigrants here — both legally and illegally — have picked crops. In some fields, almost all of the foreign workers are in the country without legal status.
While many immigrants have been on edge since President Trump vowed a crackdown on illegal immigration, the recent sweeps have been particularly concerning because they included the arrests of people not specifically targeted by ICE.
The concern extends to farmers, who fear more sweeps will drive away labor at a time when some are struggling to get enough workers to pick the crops.
Manuel Cunha Jr., president of Nisei Farmers League, which represents agricultural employers and their workers throughout the state, said farmers are worried about losing trusted workers. He said the increasingly tense relationship between the Trump administration and California, which declared itself a “sanctuary state,” has upped the anxiety.
“They’re not going to be replaced by American workers,” Cunha said. “Don’t punish the businesses. We’re not the ones that came up with the sanctuary state.”
In the February sweep across the Central Valley, 232 people were arrested. Of those, 180 were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal or had been previously removed from the U.S. and returned illegally.
The United Farm Workers of America identified at least 26 farmworkers arrested in Kern, Tulare and Madera counties, most of them stopped before dawn on their way to work.
ICE Director Thomas Homan has said that immigrants who have entered the U.S. illegally “should be afraid.”
He warned that California’s so-called sanctuary policies, which limit the cooperation between local and federal law enforcement, give the agency no choice but to make arrests in neighborhoods and at work sites. That leads to the arrests of other immigrants in the country illegally who are not intended targets, he said.
“This is a prime example of how sanctuary policies, which have pushed ICE out of jails, force our officers to conduct more enforcement in the community — which poses increased risks for law enforcement and the public,” Homan said in a statement to The Times. “It also increases the likelihood that ICE will encounter other illegal aliens who previously weren’t on our radar. It is nonsensical to demand that ICE solely focus on criminals, while simultaneously preventing ICE from arresting criminal aliens inside the secure confines of local jails.”
Win Eaton, an attorney in Bakersfield, is representing some of the detained farmworkers in immigration court.
“It’s just terrible that these people are going to be used as pawns,” he said.
On an overcast day a week after the immigration sweep, 33 workers pulled cases of jalapeño sprouts off a truck and transplanted them into tilled soil at a farm in Lamont, Calif.
Some workers said they had altered their driving routes, taking back roads instead of main highways. Many stayed tuned to Facebook groups dedicated to confirming sightings of immigration agents and reminding people of their rights.
In the early afternoon, Melitón Ferred took a water break. His lower back ached after hours of work. Ferred, who emigrated from Veracruz 13 years ago, said just being a Latino — and particularly one working in the fields — made him feel like a target.
“Who is going to work the fields? No one,” he said. “This is a difficult job, and all of us are from Mexico.”
Alejandra Galacia, 35, said she hardly left her home, not even to buy groceries, the week of the February arrests. The Lamont resident said she worried about being separated from her three young daughters.
She sat them down and told them they would all go back to Mexico together if she was deported. But her oldest daughter, who was born in Mexico and is a junior in high school, has dreams of becoming an oncologist. She told her mother she does not want to return the country of her birth.
“I leave everything in God’s hands,” Galacia said.
Dozens of workers have fled since immigration agents began checking employee records at San Joaquin Valley farms. ICE said 77 businesses — in the jurisdiction that includes Northern California, Hawaii, Guam and Saipan — were served with employment authorization audit notices in January.
Farmers have struggled in recent years with labor shortages. A summer 2017 survey by the California Farm Bureau Federation showed that 55% of responding farmers experienced shortages, with problems most acute among those whose crops require intensive hand labor, such as tree fruits and grapes.
Phil Martin, professor emeritus of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis, said while that’s true, it would take a huge, targeted immigration operation to really put a dent in the agricultural industry. That’s because production requires so many workers and the industry is using more and more people from a temporary guestworker program.
It also would take more deportation officers. While Trump last year pledged to hire 10,000 new ICE agents, Congress has yet to appropriate money for the hiring process.

Aceves, who was arrested while picking up coworkers in Wasco, Calif., spent just under a week in detention. He was released after his family posted an $8,000 bond. He could wait years before facing a judge because of a massive immigration court backlog.
Two other men in his car also were released after posting bond. The fourth man, Alfredo Diaz, voluntarily returned to Mexico after having lived illegally in the U.S. for more than two decades.
The night after his release, Aceves attended a local church service at El Aposento Alto, where his brother Guillermo Aceves has been pastor for eight years.
Guillermo, 46, told the congregation that what happened to his brother could happen to anyone. If ICE knocks on the door, don’t answer, he said. You have the right to stay silent. Don’t sign anything.
He urged them to decide who would care for their children if they were detained and to save money in case they need to pay a bond.
“These are things we don’t like to talk about because there’s so much fear,” he said. “But you have to do it. You have to make a plan.”
Jesus Aceves has been in California for two-thirds of his life, having come to the U.S. when he was 17. He has three U.S.-born children. From the pulpit, he tearfully talked about spending his days at the Adelanto Detention Facility thinking of his kids and his wife.
“I didn’t expect this. I never thought it would happen to me,” he said.
Guillermo Aceves obtained citizenship through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. But younger brother Jesus arrived in the U.S. years later and missed out on President Reagan’s amnesty. Now his future is more uncertain than ever. 
Toward the end of the service, Jesus stood in a circle with one of the other farmworkers arrested with him that late February morning. He raised his right arm in praise and shut his eyes tight as his brother led the congregation in prayer.

A man carrying $10 million in U.S. currency was arrested Friday at Tijuana's A.L. Rodriguez International Airport, authorities said.
The man was taken into custody after he tried to pick up the money — bills of different denominations that had been stuffed into 31 white plastic sacks, according to a statement from Mexico's Federal Police.
He was unable to show documentation proving the shipment's legal origin, police said.

        ""articleBody"": ""New revelations in the case of Stephon Clark, the unarmed African American man whose shooting by Sacramento police has generated controversy, raise new questions about the officers&#039; actions.But how much do they changes our view of what happened?An independent forensic pathologist hired by the family found that Clark was shot six times in the back.Dr. Bennet Omalu conducted an autopsy, which said Clark was hit by eight bullets, and all but one entered while his back was turned toward police. One bullet entered Clark&#039;s left thigh from the front and was probably fired while he was on the ground and had already been shot multiple times, Omalu said.From the beginning, there has been debate among police use-of-force experts about whether the officers&#039; actions were wrong, let alone criminal, as his family and supporters have said.Here is how two law enforcement experts say the findings fit in:Ed Obayashi, legal advisor and sheriff&#039;s deputy in Plumas County, said he believes the officers&#039; decision to shoot was reasonable based on the circumstances when confronting the young man in the backyard with an object in his hands that they perceived as a weapon and one officer yelled &#034;gun.&#034;&#034;The shots in the back. They don&#039;t change my opinion at all. Under these physical circumstances, it&#039;s not surprising he was shot in the back,&#034; Obayashi said. &#034;This is a situation of two to 2½ seconds with multiple rounds being fired here and that time passes very fast.&#034;&#034;The human brain — the mind in these situations — cannot process quick enough to stop firing,&#034; Obayashi said, so it is not uncommon to see those in confrontations with the police to be hit in the back. &#034;These officers aren&#039;t Wyatt Earp, and this isn&#039;t all Hollywood.&#034;Obayashi said the public should understand that it is as if a boxer throws a punch and misses because the opponent ducks. With firearms, it  is even harder with targets moving constantly, so shots miss and eventually hit when the person swivels or changes direction.He said the audio also suggests that officers still perceived Clark as a threat on the ground because they said, &#034;Don&#039;t move, don&#039;t move.&#034; In criminal terms, Obayashi said, it boils down to what would a reasonable officer do under these circumstances based on the information he or she possesses.Seth Stoughton, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies shootings and was a Tallahassee, Fla., police officer, said &#034;watching the helicopter video, it seems the officers are shooting after he is down on the ground.&#034;Stoughton said that when combined with the video images the back shots suggest that the young man was likely down or had fallen to the ground when officers continued to fire.&#034;If the police are justified in shooting someone, they can be justified in shooting on the ground. … Just because someone is on the ground it does not mean they are not a threat,&#034; he said.However, Stoughton said, that assumes the officers or the public face a threat in this situation. &#034;The big question here is was the shooting justified at all. And I don&#039;t think the videos provide a clear answer one way or another.&#034;Stoughton said the videos show officers confront Clark, seemingly duck for cover and then confront him again by shouting about a gun. &#034;The question is how well did officers see Mr. Clark? Another question is whether officers who had some cover could have maintained their position of relative safety until they could assess the situation.&#034;Retired Los Angeles County sheriff&#039;s Cmdr. Charles &#034;Sid&#034; Heal also said the autopsy findings need to be looked at in a larger context.&#034;I am not surprised he was shot in the back … he may have turned and ran,&#034; Heal said, adding that the officers&#039; deadly shooting is &#034;just not pretty.&#034;In this case, he said, &#034;the officers made their decision based on circumstances. &#039;Is that reasonable?&#039; is the question. Once you are convinced the suspect has a weapon, you go into response mode. Self-preservation takes over. We try to train that out of people.&#034;Clark, 22, was fatally shot in his grandmother&#039;s backyard on March 18 by Sacramento police, who were looking for a vandal in the neighborhood.On Wednesday, a police spokesman said Clark remained the sole suspect in vehicle break-ins  and what a sheriff&#039;s deputy said was the attempted break-in of a home. It was a call about those incidents that sent police to the neighborhood the night Clark was shot.A Sacramento County Sheriff&#039;s Department helicopter spotted a man in a backyard and directed police toward him, authorities said. Deputies told officers that the man had picked up a &#034;toolbar&#034; and broken the window of a home.The man was seen running south, toward the front of the house, where he stopped and looked into another car, police said. Police body camera footage shows that officers intercepted Clark in the backyard of his grandmother&#039;s house, and one of them yelled &#034;gun!&#034; as he turned a corner and saw Clark. The officer ducked momentarily, then looked around the corner again, shouted &#034;Gun! gun! gun!&#034; and began rapid fire. His partner then joined the shooting.The officers told other police who arrived on the scene they thought Clark was pointing something at them. &#034;It looked like a gun from our perspective,&#034; an officer said.The object found when they rolled over Clark&#039;s body was a white cellphone.Clark was pronounced dead at the scene. Police video shows that several minutes passed until officers approached Clark&#039;s body. They then handcuffed him before appearing to attempt resuscitation.Clark&#039;s family has disputed police accounts of what led to the shooting, and denies that he was the man police were looking for.The family&#039;s attorney said the autopsy adds to the questions.&#034;It&#039;s very simple.

New revelations in the case of Stephon Clark, the unarmed African American man whose shooting by Sacramento police has generated controversy, raise new questions about the officers' actions.
But how much do they changes our view of what happened?
An independent forensic pathologist hired by the family found that Clark was shot six times in the back.
Dr. Bennet Omalu conducted an autopsy, which said Clark was hit by eight bullets, and all but one entered while his back was turned toward police. One bullet entered Clark's left thigh from the front and was probably fired while he was on the ground and had already been shot multiple times, Omalu said.
From the beginning, there has been debate among police use-of-force experts about whether the officers' actions were wrong, let alone criminal, as his family and supporters have said.
Here is how two law enforcement experts say the findings fit in:
Ed Obayashi, legal advisor and sheriff's deputy in Plumas County, said he believes the officers' decision to shoot was reasonable based on the circumstances when confronting the young man in the backyard with an object in his hands that they perceived as a weapon and one officer yelled ""gun.""
""The shots in the back. They don't change my opinion at all. Under these physical circumstances, it's not surprising he was shot in the back,"" Obayashi said. ""This is a situation of two to 2½ seconds with multiple rounds being fired here and that time passes very fast.""
""The human brain — the mind in these situations — cannot process quick enough to stop firing,"" Obayashi said, so it is not uncommon to see those in confrontations with the police to be hit in the back. ""These officers aren't Wyatt Earp, and this isn't all Hollywood.""
Obayashi said the public should understand that it is as if a boxer throws a punch and misses because the opponent ducks. With firearms, it  is even harder with targets moving constantly, so shots miss and eventually hit when the person swivels or changes direction.
He said the audio also suggests that officers still perceived Clark as a threat on the ground because they said, ""Don't move, don't move."" In criminal terms, Obayashi said, it boils down to what would a reasonable officer do under these circumstances based on the information he or she possesses.
Seth Stoughton, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies shootings and was a Tallahassee, Fla., police officer, said ""watching the helicopter video, it seems the officers are shooting after he is down on the ground.""
Stoughton said that when combined with the video images the back shots suggest that the young man was likely down or had fallen to the ground when officers continued to fire.
""If the police are justified in shooting someone, they can be justified in shooting on the ground. … Just because someone is on the ground it does not mean they are not a threat,"" he said.
However, Stoughton said, that assumes the officers or the public face a threat in this situation. ""The big question here is was the shooting justified at all. And I don't think the videos provide a clear answer one way or another.""
Stoughton said the videos show officers confront Clark, seemingly duck for cover and then confront him again by shouting about a gun. ""The question is how well did officers see Mr. Clark? Another question is whether officers who had some cover could have maintained their position of relative safety until they could assess the situation.""
Retired Los Angeles County sheriff's Cmdr. Charles ""Sid"" Heal also said the autopsy findings need to be looked at in a larger context.
""I am not surprised he was shot in the back … he may have turned and ran,"" Heal said, adding that the officers' deadly shooting is ""just not pretty.""
In this case, he said, ""the officers made their decision based on circumstances. 'Is that reasonable?' is the question. Once you are convinced the suspect has a weapon, you go into response mode. Self-preservation takes over. We try to train that out of people.""
Clark, 22, was fatally shot in his grandmother's backyard on March 18 by Sacramento police, who were looking for a vandal in the neighborhood.
On Wednesday, a police spokesman said Clark remained the sole suspect in vehicle break-ins  and what a sheriff's deputy said was the attempted break-in of a home. It was a call about those incidents that sent police to the neighborhood the night Clark was shot.
A Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter spotted a man in a backyard and directed police toward him, authorities said. Deputies told officers that the man had picked up a ""toolbar"" and broken the window of a home.
The man was seen running south, toward the front of the house, where he stopped and looked into another car, police said. Police body camera footage shows that officers intercepted Clark in the backyard of his grandmother's house, and one of them yelled ""gun!"" as he turned a corner and saw Clark. The officer ducked momentarily, then looked around the corner again, shouted ""Gun! gun! gun!"" and began rapid fire. His partner then joined the shooting.
The officers told other police who arrived on the scene they thought Clark was pointing something at them. ""It looked like a gun from our perspective,"" an officer said.
The object found when they rolled over Clark's body was a white cellphone.
Clark was pronounced dead at the scene. Police video shows that several minutes passed until officers approached Clark's body. They then handcuffed him before appearing to attempt resuscitation.
Clark's family has disputed police accounts of what led to the shooting, and denies that he was the man police were looking for.
The family's attorney said the autopsy adds to the questions.
""It's very simple. The narrative that's been put forth is they had to open fire because he was charging toward them,"" said civil rights litigator Ben Crump, who is representing Clark's family. Yet the autopsy shows, Crump said, ""all of the bullets were from behind.""
Omalu said it appeared that the coroner did not seek to determine the pathway of the bullets, which is key to determining the sequence.
A ""cluster"" of bullets that entered Clark's back decimated his body, each carrying ""fatal capacity,"" Omalu said.
One round fractured Clark's right arm, shattering a section of bone that completely lacerated all the blood vessels around the wound, he said. Another cut through Clark's flesh and hit his spinal cord, where it caused massive bleeding.
A round went under Clark's rib, piercing his lung and caused massive bleeding in his chest, Omalu said. Another injured his aorta.
The combination of trauma, bleeding and a punctured lung would have cut off oxygen to Clark's brain but he did not die instantly, Omalu said. It took several minutes, he said.
Omalu was brought in by lawyers for Clark's family in preparation for a planned federal lawsuit against the city and its police officers. He resigned last year as chief forensic pathologist in neighboring San Joaquin County, citing allegations that the sheriff sought to sway findings to protect officers responsible for fatal shootings. Others in Omalu's office also quit, but the sheriff denied the allegations.

Many are the iconic items that may make their way into Barack Obama’s presidential library in Chicago: a pen used to sign the Affordable Care Act; his inaugural speech as the country’s first black president; the photograph of a stoic Obama in the Situation Room as Navy SEALs hunted Osama bin Laden.
But one item that will not be there is Herbie Ziskend’s baseball glove.
It sits in a less august place of honor: a glass case at Newton North High School.

Ziskend, a left-handed Newton native, got the glove from his father when he started to play ball at Bigelow Middle School. He oiled it regularly, slept with it under his mattress occasionally, and used it for games throughout his high school baseball days.
Years later, when he was a young aide in the White House in 2010, Ziskend got a call from Obama’s special assistant and body man, Reggie Love, who knew Ziskend’s love of the game. The president, Love said, needed a lefthanded glove — and quickly. 
Obama was soon going to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. — 100 years after President William Howard Taft threw out the first pitch on Opening Day of the Washington Senators’ 1910 season, beginning a storied tradition.
On the pitcher’s mound, Obama put on a Chicago White Sox cap (eliciting boos), slipped on Ziskend’s well-worn Rawlings glove, and wound up.
The president threw the ball the distance, even though the trajectory veered well high and to the left.

Ziskend got his glove back and used it to play a softball game a few days after the historic throw.
But later that month, Ziskend and housemates Eric Lesser and Jake Levine — two other young White House officials (and now a Massachusetts state senator and a California lawyer, respectively) — were sitting talking about the pitch.
“Herbie was like, ‘the pre-sident used my glove and we should treat it accordingly,’ ” recalled Levine. 
“And it started to take on a life of its own.”
Ziskend said he considered donating it to the Obama library, or perhaps even the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. But after speaking with his one-time Newton North High School baseball coach, he decided his alma mater is where it belonged.
“I’m glad,” Ziskend, 32, said, “that glove is resting at Newton North.”

Amid the fractious floor debate this month over its sexual harassment policies, the House of Representatives passed a measure waiving any previous nondisclosure agreements — effectively releasing former employees from their pact with the chamber to keep silent.
That doesn’t mean the House itself is prepared to divulge details.
The top attorney for the chamber — which enjoys an exemption from public records law — is refusing a Globe request for copies of any of the 33 written agreements that House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo said have been signed since 2010. 
DeLeo has repeatedly said the House has not executed any agreement to settle an allegation of sexual harassment in that time. And his office has said that the total number he’s disclosed includes 15 agreements the House signed with employees who were laid off more than eight years ago.
Details beyond that have been hazy. State Representative Diana DiZoglio has said, and DeLeo confirmed, that she signed one in 2011 when she was a departing aide. But the Methuen Democrat has charged that House attorneys have been “very careful in choosing not to document within the language of these agreements why certain employees have had to sign them.”
She also described them “silencing tactics” used to “cover up misdeeds.”
DeLeo has denied that. The Winthrop Democrat pointed specifically to language he authored, and the House passed March 15, waiving all past nondisclosure agreements as evidence that the charge was “irresponsible speculation.”
That brings us to the agreements themselves. DeLeo has called their use “part of doing business,” and he’s defended the House’s decision to not ban them outright, saying it gives victims an avenue of confidentiality.
In denying copies of the severance agreements and any accompanying nondisclosure clauses, House counsel James C. Kennedy pointed to the legislature’s blanket records law exemption in a succinct email to the Globe.
“Therefore,” he wrote in the two-sentence response, “your request is denied.”
To government watchdogs, the refusal to release the documents — and the underlying reason — are compounding problems.
“The state’s constitution makes it clear that members of the legislature should be accountable to the public ‘at all times’ when under the Golden Dome,” said Mary Z. Connaughton, the director of government transparency at the right-leaning Pioneer Institute.
“Yet, they hide behind a dubious public records law exemption that they themselves crafted. Ultimately, not making the agreements available leads to two harmful outcomes – voters cannot make informed decisions at the polls and perpetrators may be able to re-offend with impunity.”
Connaughton said in absence of the tangible language, the public is left to wonder. She doesn’t expect lawmakers to get the benefit of the doubt.
“The public,” she said, “will assume the worst.”

A rascal ghost of politics past has passed — nearly unnoticed.
He was only identified as an 85-year-old man who burned himself up in his Andover apartment when he tried to smoke while using his oxygen machine. But he was much more than that in the rogues gallery of the Massachusetts political world. 
In fact, he went to jail in the 1990s for what federal prosecutors said at the time was the “largest case of campaign fraud in the history of this country” — one that some have speculated may have dashed any hopes for then-US senator Paul Tsongas to keep his presidential campaign alive. 
Nick Rizzo, whose fund-raising skills took him into the inner political circles around President Jimmy Carter, Vice President Walter Mondale, and top Democratic state and national leaders of the late 1970s and 1980s, died March 8.
His gruesome death caught the attention of the major media outlets, from the Globe to Boston’s leading television station and even his hometown newspaper, the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune.
But none of the brief stories mentioned his notorious career, his rise from a middle-class Lawrence neighborhood to the political backrooms of the State House and hallways of Capitol Hill, where he demonstrated an extraordinary skill as a campaign fund-raiser.
There are no references to his equally extraordinary crash in 1992, when federal authorities found out he had embezzled $1 million in campaign funds. He had faded from public view, nearly a quarter century since his release from prison and his return to his adopted town of Andover, where he could be seen bagging groceries at the local supermarket.
Hardest hit in the scam was Tsongas, whose political career — two-term congressman, US senator, and major presidential contender — was built in good part around his relationship with Rizzo, who did what Tsongas liked least: raising political funds. 
It was seen as the most oddball alliance in Massachusetts politics — a straitlaced, serious-minded, and reserved Tsongas, whose reputation was built on his honesty and demands for clean government, tying himself closely to a fast-talking, slick money man who vacationed in Las Vegas casino hotels and loved to flash his money. 
“It was oddball, but it worked,’’ said one leading Merrimack Valley Democrat, who marveled at the relationship’s years of success. 
The scandal broke out just months after Tsongas, who died in 1997 after a long battle with cancer, had dropped out of the 1992 Democratic presidential campaign, a crowded race in which he emerged as Bill Clinton’s most serious obstacle to the party’s nomination. 
A major drag on Tsongas’ campaign was his lack of funds. What he didn’t know: Rizzo was hitting up donors — nearly $1 million, according to prosecutors — to pay off gambling debts. He was also charged with obtaining, through his Tsongas connections, $2.8 million in fraudulent bank loans.
The scheme blocked Tsongas, who was struggling to stay even with Clinton in contests around the country, from not only using the money but also qualifying for matching federal funds for his campaign. 
Rizzo was left with few if any political friends, and he alienated the cancer-suffering Tsongas when he feigned having liver cancer after he was confronted with the charges. He pleaded guilty in federal court and was sentenced in October 1993 to 52 months in federal jail.

State Representative Geoff Diehl co-chaired President Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts and has been one of the White House’s most vocal supporters in the state.
Now, it’s Diehl’s turn to get help from Trump — or at least his former mouthpiece.
Sean Spicer, the short-lived and often-parodied former White House press secretary, will headline a $250-per-head fund-raiser downtown next month for Diehl’s US Senate campaign.
Holly Robichaud, a Diehl spokeswoman, said the campaign is hoping to draw 50 to 60 people to the April 12 event at the Union Oyster House, where Spicer is billed as a “special guest” speaker.
Spicer endured a tumultuous six-month stint as Trump’s first press secretary before leaving last year amid an internal dispute with newly named communications director Anthony Scaramucci, whose own 10-day tenure was famously shorter.
But Spicer’s time was, in many ways, unforgettable in the pantheon of White House spokespeople.
On Trump’s first full day in office, he chastised reporters over coverage of the crowd size at the president’s inauguration, and soon became a regular character, as played by Melissa McCarthy, on “Saturday Night Live.”
A Rhode Island native, Spicer resurfaced in New England last fall, serving as a visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Institute of Politics. 

But even that stint wasn’t without controversy: Spicer reportedly kept his events off the record, prompting student criticism that they were secretive — if not ironic, given his former gig. Harvard officials said Spicer wasn’t the only visiting fellow to have off-the-record talks.
That Diehl, a Whitman Republican, is enlisting Spicer’s help isn’t surprising. Diehl was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign locally, and attended Trump’s inauguration the following January.
Robichaud said the campaign confirmed last week that Spicer would attend. Asked if she expected more people from Trump’s orbit to drop into the campaign, she declined comment. “We have a lot of good endorsements coming,” she said. 
Diehl is now a strong favorite to win next month’s Republican convention endorsement. He’s running in the GOP primary against Beth Lindstrom, a longtime activist in state Republican Party politics, and wealthy businessman John Kingston. 
The winner will challenge incumbent Democrat Elizabeth Warren this fall.

State Representative Diana DiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat who just days ago issued a rare public rebuke of House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, said she is launching a bid for the state Senate.
DiZoglio confirmed Wednesday that she will seek the seat held by Kathleen O’Connor Ives, a Newburyport Democrat who said this week she is not running again. 
“I have proven I will stand up for my district and for doing what’s right in my current role the last six years,” DiZoglio said. “As a state senator, I would automatically be a chairperson of a committee, and my vote would carry much more weight being one out of 40 elected officials, as opposed to being one out of 160.”
Last week DiZoglio challenged DeLeo on the House’s use of nondisclosure agreements, calling them “silencing tactics” to “cover up misdeeds by politicians and others.” DiZoglio unsuccessfully pushed lawmakers to adopt stronger language to ban the use of the agreements, even describing her own experience of signing one as an outgoing House aide in 2011.
In a phone interview, DiZoglio acknowledged that any upward rise in the House would be limited under DeLeo, especially after publicly bucking leadership on the House floor last week.
She had also voted against lifting term limits on the speakership in 2015, a vote the House made at DeLeo’s behest, and she was one of a handful of Democrats to vote against the controversial pay raise package the Legislature passed in early 2017.
DiZoglio said that she had been weighing a run for months, but that she hadn’t talked directly to O’Connor Ives before announcing her decision. She said she has $70,000 in her campaign account to start the race and has already scheduled a fund-raiser and campaign kickoff for April 5.
The Senate district includes Amesbury, Merrimac, Methuen, Haverhill, Newburyport, Salisbury, and parts of North Andover. O’Connor Ives, who first won election in 2012, said it was time for a “new chapter” in deciding not to seek reelection and pointed to devoting more attention to her family.
“The way I’ve set out to do this is to be as accessible and responsive as possible, participating in meetings, events, and other activities outside of business hours and on weekends in all seven communities I represent,” she said in a statement released before dawn. “And now, at the conclusion of this term, that time will be spoken for by a lovely and demanding toddler. 
“So, in many ways, I’m disappointed to leave the Senate,” she added, “but in my heart I know it’s the right thing to do.”
O’Connor Ives is the sixth Senator in less than a year to either leave or opt not to seek re-election to the 40-member body. She follows Linda Dorcena Forry, the Senate’s only black member, who left for the private sector this year, and Thomas McGee, a former chairman of the state Democratic party, who now is the mayor of Lynn.
Before them, Jennifer Flanagan resigned to join the state’s newly formed Cannabis Control Commission, and James Timilty left last spring to take a job as the Norfolk County treasurer. Senator Barbara L’Italien is running for Congress, effectively giving up her chance to seek reelection to her Senate seat.
They may have more company. Senator Eileen M. Donoghue is a finalist for the Lowell city manager’s job and is a favorite to replace the outgoing Kevin Murphy, who is retiring April 1. The Lowell City Council is expected to name its selection before the end of the month.
The changes promise to bring a slew of new faces to the Senate, where, on Wednesday, Senator Karen E. Spilka, an Ashland Democrat, confirmed she had secured support to be its leader next year. 
Former Senate president Stanley C. Rosenberg stepped down from the post late last year after the Globe reported that four men accused his husband, Bryon Hefner, of sexually assaulting or harassing them while boasting of his influence over Senate business. 
The Senate has since launched an Ethics Committee investigation into their former leader. Rosenberg remains in the Senate and has maintained that Hefner had no influence over the chamber’s business.
Current Senate President Harriette L. Chandler has said she does not intend to run for reelection to the position this January.

Anthony Amore, the security chief at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and a central figure in the institution’s search for its stolen artwork, is priming a campaign to become Massachusetts secretary of state. 

Amore, 51, 
who announced his campaign on Tuesday, is the first Republican contender in the race that already features a Democratic primary between longtime incumbent Secretary William F. Galvin and Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim, viewed by some as perhaps Galvin’s most high-profile challenge in his two-plus decades in office.
Amore, a Swampscott resident, said last year that he intended to challenge state Representative Lori A. Ehrlich, a Marblehead Democrat, as his first foray into politics. But in a Boston Globe interview this week, he said that shifted in recent months after conversations with party officials, calling the statewide race a “first-in-a-generation” opportunity.
Amore framed his pitch as bringing “fresh leadership” to the office, echoing an argument Zakim has used in his campaign. 

“I think that the secretary of state has a primary campaign where he’s going to have to fight. And at the same time, his opponent is a career politician. That’s not something that I am,” Amore said.
“I think I’d bring to this race the same sort of thing Charlie Baker brings to the governor’s office,” he said. “I think I could appeal to the same side of voters.”
Amore’s pivot to the race marks the state Republican party’s latest attempt to fill out its ticket under Baker and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito.
State Representative Keiko Orrall, one of the party’s national committee members, is challenging state Treasurer Deborah Goldberg, while two Cape Cod Republicans — Dan Shores and James “Jay” McMahon — are vying in a primary to face Attorney General Maura Healey. A Republican challenger has yet to emerge to run against state Auditor Suzanne Bump.
Amore has headed security at the Gardner since 2005 — a stretch that has plunged him into the public spotlight on several occasions. The museum and law enforcement have made various appeals for help cracking the infamous 1990 robbery, when thieves disguised as police officers talked their way into the museum, tied up two guards, and stole 13 pieces, including three works by Rembrandt.
Before Gardner, Amore worked at the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration, primarily on security at Logan Airport in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
Amore said he plans to continue working at the Gardner  during his 
campaign.

A top political hand and lobbyist at the Massachusetts AFL-CIO is launching a run for state Senator Eileen Donoghue’s seat, saying he anticipates that the longtime lawmaker will step aside.

John M. Drinkwater, a Lowell resident, is running after years of roving the State House as the influential union’s legislative and political director.
His name is the latest to surface in the race to succeed Donoghue, who confirmed she is a candidate for the Lowell city manager position. She’s widely considered the front-runner, but the Lowell Democrat has yet to be selected or vacate her seat.
Drinkwater said he hasn’t spoken with her, but he’s banking on her leaving.
“I am running with the expectation that this is going to be an open seat,” the 34-year-old said Monday. Asked how he arrived at that, he said he’s “working off some political reporting that I trust and put a lot of faith in.”
He said if Donoghue ultimately decides to seek reelection, he’d pull his name from the race.
A father of three, Drinkwater has been with the AFL-CIO since 2006, first as an intern, and, since 2014, as its legislative director. He’s been a registered lobbyist since March 2012, making $84,880 last year, according to records with the secretary of state’s office. He also oversees the organization’s political field program and its efforts to back labor-friendly candidates.
Now, he intends be one.
Drinkwater has filed papers with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance and pulled nomination papers in order to gather signatures. He’s also created the Twitter account @Drinkwater4Sen.
He said he doesn’t intend to leave the AFL-CIO, but rather campaign in his “spare time.”
“I haven’t got to a point to evaluating, at what point, I might transition to campaigning full time,” he said. “I’m still focused on doing my full-time day job.”
He said he intends to run with a focus on labor-friendly issues, as well as better funding for public schools.
“I’m not quite at a point in pursuing the organizational endorsement,” he said. “But I’m hoping my colleagues in labor who I have been working with for a long time will be supporting me in this race.”
Steve Tolman, the AFL-CIO’s president, said he’s spoken with Drinkwater about his interest in running, and offered high praise Monday.
“This man is the most honorable man I’ve ever worked with,” he said. “Lowell would be very lucky.”
Donoghue has not yet resigned. Her name has also been included with those who’ve floated interest in vying for the Senate presidency, a powerful post that can shape the direction of the State House.
But last week, she confirmed she is a candidate for her hometown’s city manager. A former Lowell mayor and city councilor, she’s widely considered a top choice for the job, where the current manager, Kevin Murphy, makes $190,000 a year.
The City Council has said it expects to name his successor by April 1, Murphy’s final day, and it is scheduled to narrow its list of finalists Tuesday.
But the potential for an open state Senate seat has made for much political speculation in the Merrimack Valley. Lowell City Councilor Rodney Elliott has said publicly he intends to seek the seat, and former city councilor Bill Martin has also filed papers indicating he’ll run.
Republican John MacDonald has already launched a campaign.

Congressman John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat who has spent more than five decades fighting for civil rights in marches with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and in speeches and protests on the floor of the US House, is endorsing Representative Michael E. Capuano in his Democratic primary against Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley. 
The endorsement is significant because of Lewis’ role in US history, but also because Capuano, who is white, faces Pressley, who is black, in a Boston-area district where the majority of residents are minorities.
“I know Mike Capuano as a champion and fierce advocate for those who have often been forgotten or left behind,” Lewis said in a statement released by the Capuano campaign. “Whether it’s income inequality, civil rights, gun control, health care, affordable housing, gender pay inequity, immigration or transportation, Mike has been a leader alongside those of us opposing the unfair and immoral polices of the Trump Administration.”
Lewis said Capuano knows President Trump’s policies are creating divisions and he’s been willing to “stand tall in opposing them.”
Lewis, who was first elected to Congress in 1986, said he has “come to deeply respect Mike Capuano for his leadership and courage on so many issues — that’s why I wholeheartedly support Mike for re-election and I stand with him in this campaign.”
The senators and two members of the state’s usually unified delegation aren’t backing Michael Capuano in his primary fight against Ayanna Pressley. 
Harvard University announced last month that Lewis would deliver this year’s commencement address. 
Capuano, who has picked up the endorsements of the majority of his colleagues in the Massachusetts congressional delegation, was given a cold shoulder by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward J. Markey, and Representatives Niki Tsongas and Seth Moulton. None of them are endorsing in the primary race right now.
The Seventh District is made up of Somerville, Chelsea, Everett, Randolph, and parts of Cambridge, Milton, and Boston.
The primary election is set for Sept. 4.

State Senator John F. Keenan, a Quincy Democrat, announced Tuesday that he is vying to be Senate President, joining a crowded field that has ebbed and flowed since Senator Stanley C. Rosenberg relinquished the post late last year after allegations about his husband’s behavior. 
“In recent days, I have been approached by colleagues for discussions about the future of the Senate and the Senate Presidency,” Keenan said in a statement to the Globe. “Encouraged by the confidence some have already expressed in me, I am prepared to ask my fellow Senators if they would entrust me with this role.”
The 54-year-old said he has a “tremendous respect” for the institution of the Senate and the people who serve there, and “it would be a privilege to lead this body.”
Keenan, who sometimes leans moderate in a frequently liberal chamber, said in a short interview he would “bring a sense of practicality, pragmatism, a willingness to work with all members of the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the governor” to the job.
“If we are to move forward as a state,” he said, “we have to move forward to together, and it’s important that the senate play a role.”
Keenan, a graduate of Harvard College and Suffolk University Law School, was sworn in as senator in 2011, after almost a decade on the Quincy City Council. He also served as executive director of the Norfolk County Retirement System.
Several other Democratic senators have declared their ambitions for the top post. Senators Sal N. DiDomenico of Everett and Karen E. Spilka of Ashland have been angling for their colleagues’ support for weeks. Senator Eric P. Lesser of Longmeadow has also been working to gather support. 
But others have given up the dream, at least for now. Linda Dorcena Forry, a Dorchester Democrat who was vying for the seat, left the Senate in January for the private sector.
And Senator Eileen M. Donoghue, a Lowell Democrat who was earlier in the race for the presidency, is eyeing the State House exits for a job in her hometown.
Rosenberg stepped aside as Senate President last year after the Globe detailed accusations from four men who alleged that his husband, Bryon Hefner, had sexually assaulted or harassed them and who said Hefner bragged he could influence Senate business.
Senators elevated Harriette L. Chandler of Worcester, to be acting president as the Senate investigated whether Rosenberg had broken chamber rules. But, this year, the Senate voted to drop the “acting” from Chandler’s title, an attempt in February to end weeks of intense political jockeying that had disrupted policy making on Beacon Hill.
Chandler has said she will relinquish the presidency in early January 2019, when the newly elected Senate will vote for a new Senate president.
That opening has meant the efforts to gain the chamber’s highest post have continued.
“The Senate President has made clear to her colleagues that anyone’s desire to be president should not interfere with the business of the Senate,” said Chandler spokesman Scott Zoback. “Members have largely abided by that request.”

Secretary of State William Galvin hasn’t had a primary opponent in more than a decade, and it appears that Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim’s challenge this year isn’t sitting well with the six-term incumbent.
Hours after Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera endorsed Zakim two weeks ago, Galvin called the mayor to voice his displeasure with the decision.
The conversation, according to Rivera, devolved into a heated exchange during which both men cursed at one another and Galvin accused Rivera of disloyalty, suggesting that the mayor owed him his political career.
“Verbatim, he said, ‘I made you mayor.’ You don’t forget words like that,” Rivera said.
The call from Galvin to Rivera’s cellphone came the night Rivera announced that he would be endorsing Zakim. The caller ID on the mayor’s cell showed a 617 area code, but the rest of the number was blocked, Rivera said.
Rivera said that up until that night, Feb. 16, he had never spoken to Galvin on the phone.


“He commenced to make hay about my endorsing Josh, which is not unpredictable, but what really got me shocked is that he said he made me mayor. He didn’t come knock on doors for me. I’m pretty sure my team is the reason we won that first election by 81 votes,” Rivera said. “Second, I’m not sure the state’s election official can claim that. I think he proceeded to say he sent people up here to make the election fair and I said, ‘That’s your job.’ ”

Rivera says he 
he was the first to “say something crass” because he was upset that Galvin was trying to take credit for his political accomplishments.
He called the entire conversation “unbecoming of a constitutional officer.”


Galvin was given multiple days to respond to Rivera’s characterization of the phone call and what was said, but did not respond to a request for an interview.
Since he was first elected secretary of state in 1994, Galvin has only one time drawn a primary challenger. He defeated John Bonifaz, a constitutional law attorney from Amherst, in the 2006 primary.




Rivera was first elected mayor in 2013 by a razor-thin margin after a recount confirmed his victory over former state lawmaker William Lantigua. He was reelected in 2017, but Rivera said that apart from dealing with people in Galvin’s office he had no “real relationship” with the secretary.
An election observer from Galvin’s office in 2013, during Rivera’s first campaign for mayor, found “confusion and overall chaos” at the polls in the city’s preliminary elections, according to local media reports from the time, feeding concerns about voting irregularities in the city that dated back to the 1990s.
Monitors from the state were again sent to Lawrence in 2017 to ensure a smooth election.

MIAMI (AP) — Some big name advertisers are dropping Fox News personality Laura Ingraham after she criticized one of the Florida school shooting survivors on social media.
Ingraham, a right-wing host who landed a rare one-on-one interview with President Donald Trump last year, wrote on Twitter, ‘‘David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it.’’
Hogg, a student a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who filmed students hiding from the gunman in their classrooms, was quick to respond, tweeting a list of a dozen advertisers and encouraging followers to immediately call them and ask them to drop Ingraham. Hogg has faced intense criticism from right-wing conservatives and gun advocates who have falsely called him a crisis actor following the Valentine’s Day shooting in Parkland that killed 17.


Soooo @IngrahamAngle what are your biggest advertisers ... Asking for a friend. #BoycottIngramAdverts

The online home goods store Wayfair, food company Nestle, travel website TripAdvisor, Rachel Ray’s dog food Nutrish, and Hulu all said they are among the companies removing their support from Ingraham.


We?d like to confirm that we are no longer advertising on Laura Ingraham?s show and are monitoring all of our ad placements carefully.
Wayfair said in a statement that it supports ‘‘open dialogue and debate on issues. However, the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values. We do not plan to continue advertising on this particular program.’’

Captain America has David Hogg’s back. 
TripAdvisor says it does not ‘‘condone the inappropriate comments made by this broadcaster. In our view, these statements focused on a high school student, cross the line of decency. As such, we have made a decision to stop advertising on that program.’’
A telephone message left for Nutrish was not immediately returned but the company tweeted it was in the process of removing ads from Ingraham’s show.



Hi Lisa, we are in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham?s program.

Ingraham apologized Thursday on Twitter, saying, ‘‘On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland.’’

Ingraham tweeted that she thought she was the first to feature Hogg on her show after the shooting and added, ‘‘he’s welcome to come on my show anytime for a productive discussion.’’
Hogg tweeted later Thursday that an apology to save advertisers wasn’t enough and that he'd only accept Ingraham’s apology if she denounced the way Fox News has treated his friends.
‘‘It’s time to love thy neighbor, not mudsling at children,’’ Hogg wrote.

A grand jury Thursday indicted Bryon Hefner, the husband of Senator Stanley C. Rosenberg, on multiple charges of sexual assault, criminal lewdness, and distributing nude photographs without consent. 
The indictments, issued by a statewide grand jury, follow a joint investigation by the attorney general and the Suffolk district attorney into allegations by several men, first reported by the Globe, that Hefner assaulted and harassed them during the past few years, when Rosenberg was Senate president.

RELATED: Four men allege sexual misconduct by Senate president’s husband

The alleged victims told the Globe that Hefner boasted of his influence on Beacon Hill and that they were reluctant to report his assaults for fear of alienating his powerful husband and harming their careers. Two of those men say they are among the four victims cited in Thursday’s indictment.
The indictments are a dramatic turn in a months-long controversy that led Rosenberg to step aside from the presidency late last year. 
Hefner, 30, was indicted on five counts of indecent assault and battery. The indictments allege one victim was assaulted on three occasions in Boston in 2015 and 2016 — once in an apartment, once in a restaurant, and once in a car. That alleged victim told the Globe last year that Rosenberg was present in the car but that he did not know whether the then-Senate president was aware of the assault. The Globe found no evidence that Rosenberg, 68, knew of any of Hefner’s alleged assaults. According to the indictment, Hefner sexually assaulted another victim in 2014 and exposed his genitals to that same victim in 2016, and assaulted a third victim in the summer of 2016.
On Thursday, Bryon Hefner — the husband of state Senator Stanley C. Rosenberg — was indicted on multiple charges, including sexual assault and criminal lewdness.
Prosecutors also say Hefner obtained nude and partially nude photographs of another victim without his knowledge, and sent or showed the pictures to four other people without the victim’s consent.

RELATED: Rosenberg’s husband draws FBI scrutiny

“Today’s indictments send a clear message that we will not tolerate behavior of this kind,” Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement, thanking the victims for coming forward.
District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said the joint investigation had revealed “a disturbing pattern of conduct that was not only inappropriate, but criminal. . . . We know the facts specific to this case, with many of the parties working in politics and government, made it especially daunting to come forward.”
Hefner will receive a summons to appear in Suffolk Superior Court on April 24 to be arraigned on the charges. Most of the counts carry a maximum sentence of five years in state prison. 
“It’s surreal,” one of Hefner’s alleged victims said. “I know most survivors of sexual assault never get their day in court. I’m still afraid of what happens next, but I’m also confident that all of the survivors are going to be able to get through it.”
He also said he hopes Hefner “is somewhere praying.”
Hefner’s attorney, Tracy Miner, said he would plead not guilty to the charges.
“Mr. Hefner . . . looks forward to contesting the allegations in a court of law, where evidence must be produced and witnesses can be confronted,” she said in an e-mail.
In a statement to the Globe in November, Hefner said he was shocked by the men’s allegations and could not respond to anonymous accusers. If the case proceeds to trial, those who accuse him of assaulting or exploiting them will probably face him in a courtroom.
Rosenberg, in a statement, said: “These are serious charges. They are now being handled by the judicial system. I have faith in that system and trust that it will adjudicate this case fairly.”

RELATED: Rosenberg steps aside during investigation

The indictment will likely intensify the turmoil that began in the Senate after the allegations first surfaced, costing Rosenberg his Senate presidency and leaving the chamber in disarray as others jockeyed to replace him. It comes just as a senator has claimed the votes to be the next president and legislators are attempting to move forward with the business of lawmaking.
In an emotional statement the day after the allegations against his husband first emerged, Rosenberg said he was heartbroken and expressed sympathy for those who said Hefner had assaulted them. Rosenberg, who had vowed that there would be a firewall between his personal life and State House business after an earlier controversy over Hefner’s meddling in Senate business, insisted again that Hefner had no influence over the business of the Senate.
He said Hefner had entered an inpatient treatment center for alcohol dependence. The couple has since separated.
Acting on claims that Hefner had boasted of his influence on Beacon Hill, Rosenberg’s Senate colleagues launched an independent investigation to determine whether the then-Senate president had violated chamber rules. That investigation is pending. Rosenberg stepped aside as president, initially for the duration of the Senate investigation, and Senator Harriette Chandler temporarily assumed the presidency.
Her tenure was extended after the Globe revealed in February that Hefner appears to have been more involved in Senate business than Rosenberg had claimed, with documents and some who dealt with Hefner revealing that he had access to the Senate president’s official e-mail, calendar, and contacts; had lobbied on a budget amendment; and showed a deep knowledge of Senate matters. Rather than waiting for the investigation to conclude, senators have decided to move on: Last week, Ways and Means Chairwoman Karen Spilka announced she had rounded up enough votes to be their next president.

RELATED: Spilka claimed the votes to be Senate president, but Chandler wants to serve out the year. It’s awkward

Current Senate President Chandler called the charges against Hefner “deeply disturbing” and applauded the victims for coming forward to authorities.
“Clearly, the actions described will not be tolerated, and the Senate will cooperate fully with the district attorney and attorney general’s office,” she said. “These charges illustrate why it is critical that the [Senate] investigation be completed in as thorough a manner as possible.”
In a statement Thursday, Spilka called the Hefner indictments “the latest turn in one of the toughest periods in the history of the state Senate.” 
“My colleagues and I are heartsick for the victims of these alleged crimes,” Spilka said. “There is simply no place for assault and harassment of any kind. While this and other investigations continue, it is important for all potential victims to feel safe to come forward to investigators so that the full truth can be known and addressed.”
Senator Barbara A. L’Italien, an Andover Democrat who is running for Congress, said Thursday was “a very sad day for the Senate.”
But, she added, “I do believe that the victims now feel that their stories have been heard, have been taken seriously, which I was advocating for all along. I’m sure they now feel they’re on the path toward justice being served.”
Senator Bruce E. Tarr, the Senate minority leader, said he hopes the criminal justice system works “swiftly and effectively to address what’s been alleged.”
“The behavior alleged in these indictments is shocking, it’s despicable, and it’s completely unacceptable,” Tarr said. 
A spokeswoman for Governor Charlie Baker said he and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito “commend those who came forward to report these despicable actions and believe those who engage in crimes and sexual harassment of any kind must be held accountable.”
One of the men who told his story to the Globe, but who is not among the victims included in the indictment, was distressed to learn yet more men allege Hefner assaulted them. 
“There are so many victims,” he said. Coming forward last year “was the right thing to do,” he added. “I feel some validation in that.”
The investigation into Hefner will continue, Healey and Conley said, and they appealed to others with information or allegations related to the case to contact them.

RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina is again an attractive location for big out-of-state corporations. The state no longer sits squarely in the crosshairs of culture wars over transgender rights. College basketball tournament games are back, after a one-year hiatus.
But the saga of the state’s so-called bathroom bill hasn’t been forgotten, and many Republican incumbents who passed House Bill 2 in 2016 are being targeted this election year, with the flap over the law still an issue.
In a compromise reached a year ago this week, Governor Roy Cooper — a Democrat — and the Republican-controlled General Assembly approved a partial repeal of HB 2, which did enough to remove the issue from national newscasts, to the relief of people from all sides.
“The issue is behind us in a lot of ways,” said Bob Orr, a former state Supreme Court justice. “I’m just glad that’s one less unpleasant issue that people are talking about.”
But Democrats seeking to retake control of the legislature, along with at least one Republican primary challenger, hope to benefit from anger over the law and its aftermath. The situation adds to the GOP’s challenges in districts where Democrats are already energized in opposition to President Trump and unhappy with state Republican policies on taxes, school choice expansion and the environment.
“HB 2 was a very dangerous bill, and it got my attention,” said Democrat Marcia Morgan, a lesbian and first-time candidate running this fall for the Wilmington-area House seat held by Republican Representative Ted Davis.
One of HB 2’s chief sponsors, Senator Dan Bishop of Charlotte, faces a GOP primary in early May against Beth Monaghan of Charlotte, who has a gay son.
Bishop “abandoned Republican values” of limited government, individual dignity, and equal rights, said Monaghan. “I just have too much pride in my state of North Carolina to not do something about this senator.”
Unseating Bishop would be difficult in the GOP-leaning district encompassing south Charlotte and bedroom communities outside North Carolina’s largest city. He was a longtime county commissioner and has a big campaign cash advantage. In an interview, Bishop said he can’t imagine Republicans in his district will be interested in “that unpleasant controversy that has been put to rest.”
Bishop said he plans to focus his campaign on the GOP’s tax cuts, controlled spending and the state’s improved business climate. While HB 2 “is dwelled upon by my primary opponent,” Bishop said, “I’m not hearing that as the top thing on people’s minds.”
But Democrats believe Bishop and many other Republicans in competitive districts with plenty of independent voters are vulnerable because of what the law did and its perception as discriminatory.
Republicans said HB 2 gave privacy and protection to children using restrooms and locker rooms. The law said transgender people had to use public bathrooms corresponding to their birth certificates, and barred non-discrimination ordinances by all local governments.
A national backlash affected thousands of jobs as concerts and conventions were canceled. The NCAA moved sports championships out of North Carolina, and the 2017 NBA All-Star Game set for Charlotte went elsewhere, although it’s now returning in 2019.
“In especially urban and suburban areas . . . what HB 2 did is kill the Republican brand,” said Morgan Jackson, a political consultant for Cooper and state Democrats’ legislative races. “It is still a very salient issue with swing voters.”
HB 2 and its aftermath are particularly sensitive to Charlotte. The law got passed in March 2016 response to the Charlotte City Council approving an ordinance expanding its antidiscrimination protections to LGBT people using public accommodations. It was Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican and a former mayor of Charlotte, who signed it into law.
McCrory and Democrat Jennifer Roberts, the mayor at the time the ordinance was passed, both paid a price.
McCrory narrowly lost his re-election bid in 2016 to Cooper, who made HB 2 a big issue. Gay rights groups also spent money and time seeking McCrory’s defeat. Then last fall, Roberts lost in the Democratic mayoral primary, despite her support from state and national LGBT organizations.
“The two biggest public faces of it are no longer with us — the mayor and the governor,” said state GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse, who downplays the role of HB 2 this year. Voters, he said, “were sick seeing it on TV every night. So now that it’s gone away, they want it to stay away.”
Still, a lot is riding on these elections. The partial repeal said local governments can resume enacting new ordinances expanding LGBT protections for public accommodations in December 2020.
Republicans could delay that date if they keep veto-proof majorities. But if Democrats win six more Senate seats or four more House seats to end the GOP’s super-majorities — or take even more seats, regaining control of both chambers, they might be able to revisit the issue in their favor.
Gay rights groups didn’t like the repeal bill because it still barred local governments from expanding protections for transgender people.
Matt Hirschy, interim executive director of Equality North Carolina, said he sees more impassioned candidates than ever on the subject of advancing LGBT rights. But he acknowledges the public’s malaise over the “bathroom bill” requires a different strategy than just attacking HB 2.
“There’s a lot of general fatigue about the word ‘bathroom,’” he said.

News analysis
In the past four months, the Massachusetts Senate has seen its top leader step aside, his husband indicted, a former colleague indicted, a sitting senator charged with drunken driving, and an unusual number of colleagues decide not to run for reelection.
And there could be more disruption to come. The Senate ethics committee is still expected to issue a report on the scandal involving the former Senate president. 
Even in the State House, a place that is no stranger to controversy, the chaos that’s consumed its upper chamber may be unprecedented. The result, as senators lurch from one bombshell to the next, is that the time for official business is being sidelined by salacious disclosures and internal politics. 
“It’s been a yoke around the neck. Sometimes it feels like two steps up and one step back,” Senator Anne M. Gobi said of the repeated distractions that have surrounded the 40-member body. 
“If it’s a time for rebirth,” she said, “we need it now.”
The latest blockbuster crashed through the Senate door Thursday, when a grand jury indicted Bryon Hefner, the husband of former Senate president Stanley C. Rosenberg, on multiple charges of sexual assault, criminal lewdness, and distributing nude photographs without consent.

The accusations, first reported by the Globe in November, ignited the upheaval that led to Rosenberg stepping aside in early December. 

And things have hardly settled down since Rosenberg relinquished the presidency.
Just days later, former senator Brian A. Joyce was indicted on charges he turned his public office into a criminal enterprise, after authorities said he collected about $1 million in bribes and kickbacks that he laundered through his law firm. 
Earlier this week, Senator Michael D. Brady, a Brockton Democrat, announced he was entering alcohol treatment after an arrest on drunken driving charges.
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Senate is uncertain.

Senate Karen E. Spilka announced last week that she had the votes to be the next president of the Senate. But the declaration immediately created an awkward situation with current Senate President Harriette L. Chandler, who was installed in place of Rosenberg on an acting basis before senators voted to commit to her leadership for the duration of the session in the hopes of steadying the body.
Chandler has said she hopes to finish this term. But Spilka, the Senate’s chair of the Ways & Means Committee, has said that’s open to discussion.
The question remains, however, as to whether the Senate would undertake a presidential handoff during budget deliberations, when Spilka is responsible for crafting the spending proposal as the chair of the Ways and Means Committee. And that uncertainty has left senators torn on the transition’s timing — a frustrating prospect for many who had hoped her selection would end months of time-consuming rumination on the Senate power structure.
“We know in public service and in public office we are held to a higher standard. That has been tested,” Spilka said Friday. “We need to make sure that we step up to the plate, allow for healing for these instances, and turn the page to enter a new chapter in our history.
“This will be solved,” she added of the transition, “and the budget will get done in a timely fashion.” 
Chandler, a Worcester Democrat, echoed Spilka, pointing to the Senate’s successes. 
House and Senate negotiators have agreed on a criminal justice overhaul bill, although the legislation has not passed the Legislature, nor is it clear Governor Charlie Baker supports it. On Thursday, the Senate passed a housing bond bill.
“With our successes and challenges in mind, Senator Spilka and I continue to speak to develop the best transition plan possible,” Chandler said.
But the upheaval has sowed doubts about the liberal Senate’s footing in talks with the more moderate House and Republican Baker.
“Any major legislation usually has an imprint from the House and the Senate, and this definitely affects negotiations,” said Richard Tisei, a former minority leader in the Senate who now works as a lobbyist. “The Senate has the weaker hand right now because of everything that is going on.”
Baker, too, voiced concern about the Legislature completing its official business on time.
“There are a whole bunch of bills pending and there are about 100 days where you can expect the Legislature to be in session between now and the time they break at the end of July,” he said Friday. “There’s a lot that’s left to be done here and time’s running out.”
All the while, lawmakers have tried in earnest to return to work, often with ears perked for the thud of another dropping shoe. Thursday it was Hefner. Next could be the report on the Senate ethics committee’s investigation into whether Rosenberg broke any Senate rules.

The Globe has found no evidence that Rosenberg, 68, knew of any of Hefner’s alleged assaults. But Baker said he assumes that information in the indictment would be folded into the Senate’s own probe.
“If that turns up information that implies or suggests that [Rosenberg] was aware of or knew about this stuff, then at that point, he should resign,” Baker said. “People need to be held accountable for their actions with respect to this. If it turns up that other people in the Senate were involved or participated or knew and didn’t do anything, then that all needs to be factored into the decision-making.”
Rosenberg faces a challenge in the Democratic primary this fall. Chelsea Sunday Kline, a Northampton Democrat who is running against him, weighed in Thursday, saying, “I believe the survivors,” and applauding them for coming forward in the investigation of Hefner.
Against this backdrop has been a membership thrown into flux. At least eight senators who won reelection in 2016 will not be on the ballot this November. Some have left for other jobs or are running for another office. Others have simply decided not to continue in the Senate. 
And then there is change in the Senate’s physical space.  
Its historic chamber has been sealed off and the sounds of construction ring through the halls as it undergoes a $20 million renovation project.
The plan is to reopen in January 2019, for the next legislative session. But like its body, the chamber remains a work in progress.

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he won’t immediately appoint a new special counsel to investigate a number of Republican grievances involving the Justice Department, despite mounting pressure from members of his own party.
Sessions told congressional committees in a letter Thursday that a senior federal prosecutor, Utah’s US attorney John W. Huber, is continuing to evaluate ‘‘certain issues,’’ including whether such an appointment is necessary.
Sessions isn’t specifying the issues, but Republicans have called for special counsels to investigate Clinton Foundation dealings and an Obama-era uranium deal. More recently they’ve sought a special counsel to study perceived bias in the FBI and Justice Department during its probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails and the Russia investigation.
Sessions’ letter comes after the department’s inspector general announced it would review those allegations.

RICHFIELD, Ohio - President Donald Trump flew here Thursday to promote his infrastructure plan, but after a week of seclusion as he has been besieged by an adult-film star’s allegations of an affair and by news on the Russia probe, he delivered his thoughts on a variety of topics, from the midterm elections to his North Korea talks.
Trump threatened to delay finalizing his renegotiated trade deal with South Korea until after he meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and resolves the nuclear confrontation with Kim’s rogue nation.
‘‘I may hold it up until after a deal is made with North Korea,’’ Trump said. ‘‘You know why? Because it’s a very strong card and I want to make sure everyone is treated fairly and we’re moving along very nicely with North Korea.’’
Regarding his still-unscheduled upcoming meeting with Kim, Trump said, ‘‘If it’s no good, we’re walking, and if it’s good, we will embrace it.’’
Trump’s speech felt at times like a stream of consciousness commentary reminiscent of his signature campaign rallies from 2016, as he zigzagged from his prepared text on infrastructure policy to his thoughts on issues of the day, like this week’s debut of the remake of ‘‘Roseanne.’’
‘‘Look at her ratings!’’ the president said of Roseanne Barr, the Trump supporter who is the show’s star. Its two-episode premiere drew 18.2 million viewers.
Rallying union engineers and maintenance workers inside a chilly and dirt-floored industrial barn here in Richfield, on the outskirts of Cleveland, Trump used his official, taxpayer-funded visit to warn his political supporters against complacency in the fall midterm elections. 
As Trump told it, the country was headed in the wrong direction - until he took office. ‘‘There’s never been an economy like this,’’ he boasted. ‘‘We can’t lose that by getting hurt in the midterms, so we can’t be complacent.’’
Trump promised to repair the nation’s ailing roads, bridges and other infrastructure ‘‘from a source of endless frustration into a source of absolutely incredible pride.’’
‘‘And we’re going to do it all under budget and ahead of schedule,’’ the president promised, seeming to look past the reality that his $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan has little apparent momentum on Capitol Hill. The plan has received only tepid support from Congress since the administration unveiled it earlier this year.
Chief among the infrastructure projects Trump promoted here was his long-promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.
‘‘We’re getting that sucker built!’’ Trump said. ‘‘That’s what I do. I build. I was always very good at building. It was my best thing. I think better than being president, I was always very good at building.’’
Trump’s visit to Ohio is his first public appearance this week - a notable absence from the spotlight for a president who relishes the give-and-take with reporters and typically has daily opportunities for the media to see him doing his job. 
Trump has not been seen in public since porn actress Stormy Daniels appeared last Sunday night on ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ detailing her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.
An estimated 22 million Americans watched the CBS broadcast - including the president, aides said, who fumed about it privately but withheld any public comments or counterattacks. White House spokespeople said Trump categorically denied all the allegations made by Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
In his Ohio speech, Trump remained silent on the Daniels saga and instead talked about a medley of issues that animate the working-class voters who voted for him. He talked about defeating Islamic State terrorists, renegotiating trade deals, investing in the military, nominating conservative judges and cracking down on illegal immigration.
Trump speech was reminiscent of his campaign rallies. Indeed, he twice mentioned his 2016 foe, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Bemoaning the U.S. trade agreement with South Korea, which his administration renegotiated this week, Trump called the KORUS deal ‘‘a Hillary Clinton special’’ - perhaps because she was secretary of state when former president Barack Obama negotiated the last iteration of the agreement in 2010. But the treaty was first executed in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration.
As is typical for Trump, the president appeared at several times to veer off his prepared remarks on infrastructure policy to interject with comments perhaps designed to appeal to his audience.
‘‘I don’t know what that means, a community college,’’ Trump said at one point. ‘‘Call it vocational and technical. People know what that means. They don’t know what a community college means.’’
As he left the Oval Office on Thursday morning to begin his trip to Ohio, Trump bade farewell to Hope Hicks, one of his longest-serving aides and closest confidantes. Hicks is leaving her post as White House communications director.
Trump is set to join his family Thursday evening in Palm Beach, Florida, where he will spend the Easter holiday weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago estate. First lady Melania Trump and the couple’s 12-year-old son, Barron, have been at Mar-a-Lago for the full week on what aides called a traditional spring break.
Trump’s two daughters joined him on the trip to Ohio and onto Florida: Ivanka Trump, a White House senior adviser who helps steer the infrastructure agenda, and Tiffany Trump, a law student.

LOS ANGELES — Actress turned conservative commentator Stacey Dash ended her campaign for a Southern California congressional seat on Friday, about a month after it began.
The ‘‘Clueless’’ star said in a statement on her website that she believed the bitterness in politics and the rigors of campaigning and holding office would be detrimental to her family.
Dash, a Republican, faced long odds in the heavily Democratic 44th District, which includes part of Los Angeles, the city of Compton and other communities running south of downtown L.A.
Republicans account for only about 10 percent of the voters in the district, which Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election with 83 percent of the vote.
There was no Republican on the ballot in the district’s November 2016 House contest, which Democrat Nanette Barragan won.
In her statement, Dash lamented a political system that ‘‘offers people on the lower end of the economic spectrum little more than symbolic gestures.’’
Dash co-starred in the 1995 coming-of-age comedy film ‘‘Clueless.’’ She worked as an on-air contributor at Fox News until 2016.

President Trump on Wednesday announced that Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, was his pick to lead the Veterans Administration. Here are five things you need to know about Jackson and the agency he will inherit:

■Jackson, 50, a Navy doctor since 1995 who holds the rank of rear admiral, is usually in the White House residence with Trump and travels with him regularly. He checks on Trump daily and the two have developed a bond, with Jackson joking around and Trump telling friends he thinks Jackson is smart. Trump calls Jackson “The Doc,” the Washington Post reports.  Jackson, who has no real experience running a large bureaucracy,  will take over an agency that employs 360,000 people, has a budget of $186 billion  — and faces major challenges.

■A native of Levelland, Texas, Jackson has an undergraduate degree in marine biology, and a medical degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch, according to his official Navy biography. He is “uniquely qualified in submarine and hyperbaric medicine,” the bio says. He is also an emergency medicine expert, using those skills during a deployment in Taqaddum, Iraq.

■Why does he seem recognizable? You’ve seen him before because, decked out in his Navy uniform, he made a splash in mid-January with his full-throated endorsement of Trump’s health after examining him. Questions had been raised about Trump’s mental fitness; Trump had fired back on Twitter that he was a “very stable genius.” Jackson said Trump had aced a cognitive exam and was”very sharp” and “very articulate.” He also praised Trump’s genes, saying he has “incredibly good genes, and it’s just the way God made him.”




■Trump announced Jackson’s appointment on Twitter late Wednesday afternoon. Trump did not tell many advisers of the move until soon before it was announced, the New York Times reported. The move was the latest in a series of head-spinning changes at the top level of the turbulent Trump administration that have recently included the replacement of the secretary of state, the CIA director, the national security adviser, and various White House aides.



I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs....


Ronny Jackson has no experience leading a large government agency. The sprawling Department of Veterans Affairs is that and more.
■Jackson, whose policy views are nearly unknown, faces a host of challenges ahead at the agency, the second-largest bureaucracy in the federal government. The VA is suffering from a shortage of doctors and other caregivers, and its electronic medical records system needs a costly overhaul. He’ll also be thrust into the midst of a debate over whether veterans should be allowed more access to private doctors outside the VA system. The White House wants it, while many veterans groups fear a privatized system would drain resources.

WASHINGTON — An obscure White House office responsible for recruiting and screening thousands of political appointees has suffered from inexperience and a shortage of staff, hobbling the Trump administration’s efforts to place qualified people in key posts across government, documents and interviews show.
At the same time, two office leaders have spotty records themselves: a college dropout with arrests for drunken driving and bad checks, and a lance corporal in the Marine Corps reserves with arrests for assault, disorderly conduct, fleeing an officer, and underage drinking.
The Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) is little known outside political circles. But it has far-reaching influence as a gateway for the appointed officials who carry out the president’s policies and run federal agencies.
Under President Trump, the office was launched with far fewer people than in prior administrations. It has served as a refuge for young campaign workers, a stopover for senior officials on their way to other posts, and a source of jobs for friends and family, a Washington Post investigation found. 
One senior staffer has had four relatives receive appointments through the office.
On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to surround himself ‘‘only with the best and most serious people,’’ but his administration has been buffeted by failed appointments and vacancies in key posts.
From the start, the office struggled to keep pace with its enormous responsibilities, with only about 30 employees on hand, less than a third of the staffing in prior administrations, The Post found. 
Six senior officials over age 35 went elsewhere in government just months after their arrival, documents and interviews show. Since the inauguration, most of the staffers in the PPO have been in their 20s, some with little professional experience apart from their work on Trump’s campaign, The Post found.
Even as the demands to fill government mounted, the PPO offices on the first floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building became something of a social hub, where young staffers from throughout the administration stopped by to hang out on couches and smoke electronic cigarettes, known as vaping, current and former White House officials said. 
PPO leaders hosted happy hours last year in their offices that included beer, wine, and snacks for dozens of PPO employees and White House liaisons who work in federal agencies, White House officials confirmed. 
In January, they played a drinking game in the office called ‘‘Icing’’ to celebrate the deputy director’s 30th birthday. Icing involves hiding a bottle of Smirnoff Ice, a flavored malt liquor, and demanding that the person who discovers it, in this case the deputy director, guzzle it.
The White House confirmed that PPO officials played the Icing game but said it and the happy hours are not unique to the PPO and are a way to network and let off steam.
The PPO is ultimately responsible for recruiting and vetting candidates for more than 4,000 jobs, about 1,600 requiring Senate approval.
The shortcomings of the office, and Trump’s appointment process in general, are among the most pronounced in memory, according to presidential scholars. ‘‘No administration has done it as poorly as the current one,’’ said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group.
‘’
White House officials said the PPO is performing well, even though they acknowledged the office is much smaller “than at any time in recent history.’’ 
The officials said the office is starting to make progress on nominees for positions that require Senate confirmation. They blamed delays on Democrats and slow background checks. 
In a separate development, a New York court has ruled that a defamation suit against Trump filed by Summer Zervos, a California restaurant owner and former contestant on ‘‘The Apprentice,’’ could go forward. Zervos wants less than $3,000 and an apology for what she said were unwanted sexual advances, the Associated Press reported.
If the lawsuit continues, Trump might have to answer potentially embarrassing questions under oath about his relationships with women. The president’s attempts to get the lawsuit tossed out have failed so far, but the battle isn’t over yet.
Near the end of the presidential race, Zervos and more than a dozen other women came forward to say Trump had sexually harassed or assaulted them.
Zervos, who appeared on ‘‘The Apprentice’’ in 2006, said that when she returned months later to inquire about a job, Trump groped and forcibly kissed her. Trump has said that Zervos and his other accusers made up phony stories to get attention.
Also Friday, a new poll found that a majority of young people believe Trump is racist, dishonest, and ‘‘mentally unfit’’ for office.
The poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found the nation’s youngest potential voters are more concerned about the Republican’s performance in the White House than older Americans.
Just 33 percent of Americans between the ages of 15 and 34 approve of Trump’s job performance, the poll found. That’s 9 points lower than all adults, who were asked the same question on a separate AP-NORC survey taken this month.

SAN FRANCISCO — California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday pardoned five ex-convicts facing deportation, including two whose families fled the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia four decades ago.
The pardons don't automatically stop deportation proceedings, but eliminate the state convictions federal authorities based their deportation decisions on. That gives the men's lawyers strong legal arguments before immigration judges to try to prevent the deportations.
""The pardon does provide enormous benefit to immigrants facing deportation,"" said Anoop Prasad, an immigration staff attorney at Asian Law Caucus.
The move drew criticism from President Donald Trump on Saturday.
Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews
Brown's action on behalf of the men — among 56 pardoned — marked the Democratic governor's third consecutive pardon round in which he intervened on behalf of immigrants who were deported or faced deportation because of criminal convictions. Brown has accused the Trump administration of ""basically going to war"" with California over immigration policy.
Brown last year signed sanctuary legislation limiting state and local cooperation with federal enforcement of immigration laws. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions responded with a Department of Justice lawsuit seeking to invalidate three state laws protecting residents living in the country without documentation.
Those pardoned Friday included Sokha Chhan and Phann Pheach, both of whom face deportation to Cambodia, a country ruled in the 1970s by the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Chhan was convicted of two counts of misdemeanor domestic violence in 2002 and served 364 days in jail.
Pheach was convicted of possessing drugs and obstructing a police officer in 2005 and served six months in jail. His wife said he is in federal custody.
Also pardoned was Daniel Maher, who was convicted in 1995 of kidnapping, robbery and being a felon in possession of a firearm and served five years in prison. Maher is facing deportation to China.
Chhan, Pheach and Maher hold permanent U.S. residency but had exhausted all legal avenues to fight deportation, making Brown's pardons for them their last hope to stay in the U.S., Prasad said.
""This is a life-changing, enormous event,"" he said.
Also pardoned while facing deportation were Daniel Mena and Francisco Acevedo Alaniz, but their home countries were not immediately known. Mena was convicted in 2003 of possessing illegal drugs. Alaniz served five months in prison for a 1997 auto theft conviction.
Brown on Friday also commuted the sentences of 14 others convicted of crimes.
The governor is a former Jesuit seminarian and traditionally issues pardons close to major Christian holidays. Easter falls on Sunday.
California's longest-serving governor has now issued 1,519 pardons, including 404 during his first two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983.
Brown's father, Edmund G. ""Pat"" Brown issued 467 pardons and 55 commutations, but there have been long stretches of very few in California.
From 1991 through 2010, former Govs. Pete Wilson and Gray Davis issued no pardons while Arnold Schwarzenegger handed out just 15.

WASHINGTON — As the two parties battle for control of Congress in this year's midterm elections, it follows that most of the political world would pay little attention to the election in New York's 25th District.
That's because the Rochester-based seat left open by Rep. Louise Slaughter's death earlier this month is a virtual lock to elect a Democrat.
Slaughter won there 16 times, Hillary Clinton won it by more than 15 percentage points in 2016 and Democrats have a ready-made candidate in state Assembly Majority Leader Joe Morelle, who wasted little time in rounding up local Democratic officials and Slaughter family members to coalesce behind his bid.
But EMILY's List wants the party to hit the pause button on Morelle, who is 61.
Top officials at the Washington-based political network that recruits, trains and funds abortion-rights-backing Democratic women candidates see a chance to elect a younger woman to a seat that could be in the party's hands for decades to come.
Across the country, EMILY's List is backing more than 40 women House candidates, including many in the high-profile swing districts that will determine which party controls the House in the next Congress.
But in an important way, the safe House seats have more long-term value for a group trying to empower women in Congress. The more they can help women get elected to safe House seats, the more likely it is that future leaders in the House will be women.
For lawmakers to win chairmanships in the seniority-based committee system, they have to get re-elected repeatedly. That's easier in politically safe districts. So is advancing in party leadership, which requires modern House members to take highly partisan stands and spend much of their time outside their districts raising money for colleagues.
The formula's ""not a huge mystery,"" said Danielle Thomsen, an assistant professor of political science at Syracuse University who hasstudied candidates and polarization in Congress.
Top officials at EMILY's List see Sarah Clark, the 44-year-old deputy state director for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and an alumna of then-Sen. Hillary Clinton's office, as the kind of candidate who could someday become a force in the House, like Slaughter, who rose to become the top Democrat on the powerful House Rules Committee.
They dispatched veteran political operative Angela Kouters to Rochester to try to convince Clark to jump in the race before Morelle can lock up all the support he needs.
""We're in the process of really taking a look at this with her,"" EMILY's List President Stephanie Schriock told NBC News.
Clark, who did not return calls from NBC News, has agreed to collect the signatures she'd need to get on the ballot while she weighs whether to jump in, according to a person familiar with her plans.
Schriock wants Democrats to wait a beat before deciding Morelle is the best person to take Slaughter's seat because she thinks men — particularly white men — are sometimes quicker out of the gate to announce their candidacies.
""Women potential candidates often take a little more time to decide,"" she said. ""If we don't pause, we don't get women in the mix and we don't get people of color in the mix.""
Sometimes, there's a tension between EMILY's List's two main missions: electing Democratic women who support abortion rights and helping Democrats take control of the House. That is, sometimes party leaders don't think the EMILY's List candidate is the best one to win in a particular swing district.
This year, the group has found itself at odds with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in a handful of competitive primaries. That's caused consternation within Democratic ranks when it's happened in swing districts, where party officials are most concerned about ensuring victory in November.
But the open seat in Rochester represents a more traditional battleground for EMILY's List— a place where there's little chance that nominating a particular candidate will cost Democrats a seat in the House. And if they can stock the benches of the House chamber with women, the next leaders of the party are more likely to come from those ranks.
""You better believe this is a piece of the puzzle for us,"" Schriock said.
CORRECTION (March 31, 2018, 9:28 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of a Syracuse University assistant professor of political science. She is Danielle Thomsen, not Thomson.

WASHINGTON — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency paid just $50 a night to stay in a Capitol Hill condominium linked to a prominent Washington lobbyist whose firm represents a roster of fossil fuel companies.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt paid for a single bedroom in the building on a leafy street about a block from the U.S. Capitol, staying for about six months in 2017 during nights he was in Washington. Records show three units inside the building are listed as belonging to a corporation co-owned by the wife of J. Steven Hart, the chairman and CEO of the powerhouse lobbying firm Williams and Jensen PLLC.
The firm's clients include Exxon Mobil Corp. and the major liquefied natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy Inc. — companies that have billions at stake in regulatory decisions over which Pruitt presides. Records show in at least one case Pruitt met in his EPA office with a lobbyist from Hart's firm while he was renting the room.
Justina Fugh, an ethics lawyer at EPA, told The Associated Press on Friday Pruitt's rental agreement allowed him to only pay for nights he occupied the room, totaling about $6,000 in payments over the term of the lease.
Fugh said she was first briefed by other EPA officials about the terms of lease on Thursday, shortly after ABC News first reported on Pruitt's prior living arrangements. Fugh said she was not asked to review the lease or issue a formal legal opinion on it, though she did not immediately see it as an ethical concern since Pruitt paid for the room.
Fugh said she was told Pruitt has since moved to another apartment, though she said she was not privy to any details about where the administrator is currently staying, who owns that property or what rate he is paying.
Inside the White House on Friday, staffers expressed frustration by the optics of Pruitt's living arrangements, which come on the heels of the dismissal of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin over ethical missteps.
But while officials in the West Wing are reviewing the seriousness of the questions around Pruitt, it was too soon to know if the EPA secretary would face harsh internal questioning or draw the ire of President Donald Trump, according to a White House official not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.
A Republican who previously served as the state attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt has long been a champion of the oil and gas industry. In the year he has served as the Trump administration's top environmental official, Pruitt has moved to scrap, gut or replace numerous environmental regulations opposed by the industry while boosting the continued burning of fossil fuels, which is the primary cause of climate change.
In December, Pruitt and members of his staff spent about $40,000 in taxpayer funds to fly to Morocco to help encourage the North African kingdom to import liquefied natural gas from the United States. Cheniere, the lobbying client of Hart's firm, is currently the only exporter of liquefied natural gas from the continental United States.
In a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday, Hart said Pruitt is a casual friend from Oklahoma who moved into the building in early 2017. Hart said he had no contact with Pruitt for many months, other than a brief exchange at the National Prayer Breakfast in February.
""Pruitt signed a market based, short-term lease for a condo owned partially by my wife,"" Hart said, according to a statement released by his firm. ""Pruitt paid all rent owed as agreed to in the lease. My wife does not, and has not ever lobbied the EPA on any matters.""
Hart's wife, Vicki Hart, is also a lobbyist, focusing on health care issues.
EPA's press office also did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday or Friday about Pruitt's Washington living arrangements.
The $50 a night rate Pruitt paid is significantly less than advertised rates for rentals in the Capitol Hill neighborhood where the unit is located. One bedroom apartments listed for rent in the immediate area on Friday ranged between $1,600 and $2,500 a month, depending on amenities. Single rooms listed online for one-night rentals averaged about $120 a night.
Pruitt has been under increasing scrutiny for this frequent taxpayer-funded travel, which has included first-class airline tickets. Though federal regulations typically require federal officials to fly in coach, the EPA chief has said he needed to sit in premium seats due to security concerns.
After a series of recent media reports about questionable spending, Pruitt was one four high-ranking Trump officials who met separately with White House Cabinet Secretary William McGinley to discuss proper ethics practices.
The president is still said to be fond of Pruitt and has applauded the EPA secretary for his attention-grabbing dust-ups with environmentalist groups, according to the White House official and an outside Trump adviser.
Both a House oversight committee and the EPA's inspector general are now reviewing Pruitt's travel spending. Jeffrey Lagda, a spokesman for EPA's internal watchdog, said Friday that the office has been ""made aware of the allegations related to Administrator Pruitt's living arrangements last year.""
Pruitt's EPA travel  has also often included weekend-long layovers at his home in Tulsa. The EPA chief is widely mentioned in Oklahoma as a possible successor to Sen. James Inhofe, the state's octogenarian GOP senator who is expected to retire at the end of his current term.
Among the clients at Hart's lobbying firm is OGE Energy Corp., an electricity company serving Oklahoma and Arkansas. According to federal disclosure reports, the company paid Williams and Jensen $400,000 in 2017 to lobby on issues that included EPA regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
Copies of Pruitt's daily calendar obtained by the AP through a public records request show that Pruitt held a March 2017 meeting in his EPA office with OGE Chairman and CEO Sean Trauschke and company vice president Paul Renfrow. The meeting was arranged at the request of George Baker, a registered lobbyist from Hart's firm, who also attended.
In October, EPA announced it would rewrite the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation that sought to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants like those operated by OGE. EPA has also moved to scrap regulations cutting power plant emissions of such toxic substances as mercury, as well as tighter standards on dumps containing coal ash.
Records show Pruitt has had a long relationship with OGE. Campaign finance reports from Oklahoma show more than three dozen OGE executives donated to Pruitt's 2014 re-election campaign for state attorney general, even though he was running without a Democratic opponent. OGE chairman Peter Delaney contributed $3,500, while Trauschke kicked in $2,500 and Renfrow contributed $1,000.
Environmental groups pointed to news of Pruitt's living arrangements as further evidence he caters to polluters, and they renewed their calls for him to resign.
""Scott Pruitt got a sweetheart deal on a D.C. condo directly from a fossil fuel lobbyist, then wasted thousands in taxpayer dollars pushing that lobbyist's agenda on a trip to Morocco,"" said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. ""This deal stinks like the swamp Scott Pruitt is mired in.""

Supporters of Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director who was fired earlier this month just days shy of his planned retirement, have set up a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for his legal defense and have raised nearly $500,000 in just its first day.
The campaign — titled the ""Andrew McCabe Legal Defense Fund"" — was created Thursday by a group called ""Friends of Andrew McCabe,"" which had originally set a goal of raising $150,000, but quickly blew through that and set a new goal of $250,000.
As of Friday afternoon, the campaign had raised $453,312 from what is says are 10,692 donations in just one day. That amount is equivalent to more than $42 donated per person.
Earlier this month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe, who took the reins of the agency during the turbulent days after the abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey, just two days before he was to retire and become eligible for full pension benefits.
Sessions said at the time that he'd accepted an internal recommendation from the FBI that McCabe, a 21-year agency veteran, be terminated.
McCabe's supporters have expressed concern that could face criminal prosecution if the Justice Department report from the inspector general refers his case.
""Andrew McCabe’s FBI career was long, distinguished, and unblemished,"" the GoFundMe page's creators wrote on the site. ""He embraced the most daunting, difficult, and important challenges that the FBI and the country could assign to him over the past 21 years...His reward for that has been a termination that was completely unjustified, amidst repeated ad hominem attacks by the President of the United States.""
Though McCabe — who has been repeatedly attacked by President Donald Trump — stepped down as deputy director in late January, he remained on the federal payroll, and had planned to retire on Sunday March 18. His firing places his federal pension in jeopardy.
The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility proposed the termination, based on the findings of the Justice Department's inspector general. As part of the inquiry, McCabe was questioned about conversations FBI officials had with a reporter in October 2016 regarding the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation. The inspector general's report concluded that McCabe was not completely candid in answering questions about those conversations, according to officials familiar with the report.
In statement released after the firing was announced, McCabe said: ""This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the special counsel's work.""

A Texas woman was sentenced to five years behind bars this week for voting illegally in the 2016 election while on supervised release from federal prison.
Crystal Mason, 43, testified in court that she did not know that she was ineligible to vote due to her 2011 fraud conviction before casting a provisional ballot in the presidential election. In Texas, knowingly voting illegally is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
""A second degree felony for voting illegally? That's outrageous,"" J. Warren St. John, her defense attorney, told NBC News on Friday. ""The punishment does not fit this crime.""
Texas' ballot asks voters to certify that they have completed their sentences — including supervision — if they have previously been convicted of a felony. Mason testified in court that she did not read the fine print because an election worker was helping her with the provisional ballot.
""She voted in good faith,"" St. John said, noting that she accurately filled out her own information and wasn't trying to obscure her identity. ""She didn’t intentionally vote illegally and that’s the whole issue.""
Mason had pleaded guilty in 2011 to inflating tax returns while working as a tax preparer and was sentenced to 60 months in federal prison, according to her attorney. She had served roughly three years before being released in 2016.
St. John said that Mason was never told in court, prison, or her halfway house that she couldn't vote until the entirety of her sentence was complete. Her probation officer also testified in court that he had not told her she couldn't vote.
Mason is appealing the judge's ruling, and out on bond pending that appeal. Because the crime is also a violation of her supervised release, she could still be arrested by federal authorities and sentenced to additional federal jail time for violating the terms of her release. St. John said federal court had not yet issued a warrant over the violation, however.
Mason is not the first to receive a severe sentence for voting illegally. A Texas resident and Mexican citizen with a green card, Rosa Maria Ortega, was sentenced to eight years in prison for casting an illegal ballot. Ortega had even served as a poll worker, and she, too, reportedly said  she did not know she couldn’t vote.
Still, not everyone gets hard time. A North Carolina prosecutor declined to bring charges against a woman who said she cast an illegal vote for Donald Trump in order to fulfill her mother's dying wish. ""She made a mistake out of sheer ignorance without any intent to defraud or commit a crime,"" the prosecutor said, according to a local report.
An estimated 6.1 million Americans are disenfranchised by a felony conviction, something many states are rethinking as those numbers continue to rise alongside skyrocketing incarceration rates.

Fired Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin said he believes that Trump administration political appointees sent to the department were working to undermine him.
Shulkin also said on MSNBC's ""All In with Chris Hayes"" Thursday that he spoke to President Donald Trump by phone on Wednesday, the same day the president announced on Twitter that Shulkin would be replaced with the White House physician, Adm. Ronny Jackson.
Trump gave no indication during Wednesday’s call that he would be fired, Shulkin said. ""Chief of staff Kelly gave me a call, which I appreciated, he gave me a heads-up,"" Shulkin said, ""but that was much after the phone call.""
Shulkin said that during the phone call Trump was ""very focused, he was very inquisitive about the things that we were working on, making sure that we were focused on the job at hand.""
The interview follows an op-ed Shulkin wrote for The New York Times that was published online Wednesday in which he said that ""the advocates within the administration for privatizing V.A. health services"" reject debate and that ""they saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had to be removed.""
He said in the Times that ""I am convinced that privatization is a political issue aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits, even if it undermines care for veterans.""
In another interview, on Friday morning with MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Shulkin said he remained ""very concerned about the future of the VA ... and that it's not hijacked and dismantled.""
Shulkin told MSNBC the night before that Trump has the clear authority to decide who he wants to head the agency.
""There was clear evidence, though, that the political appointees inside the VA were working against me and my leadership team because they felt that we were trying to strengthen the VA rather than moving towards privatization,"" Shulkin said, declining to state names.
Shulkin said he saw no evidence that efforts to block him were directed by Trump.
""I think that the president wants to improve care for veterans,"" Shulkin said. ""I think that he is not served well by political appointees who are taking their own personal agendas much further than I think that he intended them to.""
Shulkin, who served as undersecretary in charge of the veterans’ health system during the Obama administration, clashed with Trump political appointees who surrounded him at the VA.
Some of the tension arose from a central policy dispute: The Trump appointees, both within the VA and at the White House, reportedly want to see the VA transition to subsidizing private health care for veterans, while Shulkin resisted those efforts.
""I think that this is a very complex organization, and from the outside it seems easy — why aren’t things fixed faster,"" Shulkin said on MSNBC Thursday. ""The truth is that the VA has had systemic problems for decades, which spans multiple administrations.""
A VA inspector general's report in February found that taxpayers had picked up the tab for Shulkin’s wife when she accompanied him on a European business trip.
Shulkin said Thursday that he did nothing wrong, and that the IG found that staff made mistakes, that he had no knowledge of it and that after he was informed he paid back all of the funds in question.
The report said that Shulkin’s chief of staff doctored emails to justify his wife traveling to Europe. Shulkin said the chief of staff chose to retire after the report. “If you change records, of course that’s wrong,” Shulkin said. ""But the inspector general report also said very clearly that I wasn’t involved.""
The former Veterans Affair secretary said he is willing to provide any assistance he can to Jackson, his replacement, but said Jackson will need a solid team to surround him if he wants to succeed.
""I don’t think anybody is necessarily prepared for a job this big,"" he told ""Morning Joe.""
The removal of Shulkin comes amid a spate of firings or other dismissals in the Trump administration, including the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster.
Shulkin was confirmed by the Senate in 2017 by a vote of 100-0.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars in a statement on Thursday praised Shulkin and was critical of Trump’s choice to replace him with Jackson.
“Dr. Jackson’s bio does not reflect any experience working with the VA or with veterans, or managing any organization of size, much less one as multifaceted as the Department of Veterans Affairs, so the VFW will be closely monitoring his Senate confirmation process,” the veterans group said.
But the VFW noted that Jackson served in Iraq as an emergency physician and recognized his service.
“We look forward to working with him and his staff to continue building upon the progress created by his predecessors, progress that properly takes care of America’s wounded, ill and injured veterans first,” VFW National Commander Keith Harman said.

Billed as infrastructure remarks, President Donald Trump’s Thursday speech tackled everything from sitcom ratings to space travel and gun control. He got a few things wrong in the process, or made claims that could use more context.
Here are 7 misleading or false statements, and the facts behind them.
1. ""Bump stocks are now under very strict control.""
The Justice Department has proposed a regulation that would ban the devices that allow semi-automatic firearms to fire more rapidly — but nothing has been enacted.
2. ""African-American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded.""
It did so in December, but the rate has since risen, according to federal data.
3. ""And we got the down payment, $1.6 billion, on the wall.""
Trump is referring to the $1.6 billion allocated for border security in the new government spending bill. But that money cannot be used to build any kind of new wall like the prototypes Trump boasted about earlier in the speech.
4. ""America built the Empire State Building in 1 year. Think of it. One year. It's actually like nine months.""
It took one year and 45 days, according to the building management.
5. ""When I got in, there were over 100 federal judges that weren’t appointed. Now I don’t know why Obama left that, it was like a big beautiful present to all of us. Why the hell did he leave that?""
Republicans chose not to approve a large number of President Barack Obama's judicial appointees. During his last two years, just 22 nominees were confirmed, the lowest number since the final two years of Harry Truman's presidency. Meanwhile, dozens were blocked.
6. ""When somebody does a bad jobs in the Veterans Administration, they couldn’t do anything about it. They were protected. You could do anything... They had people that wouldn’t work, you couldn’t do anything.""
It is not true to say that you couldn’t remove bad employees at the VA before Trump became president. Thousands were fired from the VA under Obama for performance or discipline reasons, according to reported Office of Personnel Management data.
7. ""Remember I used to say keep the oil — as a civilian! I used to say, did anybody hear me say that? That’s before I decided to go on this journey with all of you, I got tired of watching.""
Trump said that the U.S. should have taken Iraq's oil as a presidential candidate, too, and suggested America might get “another chance” to do so a day after his inauguration.

Russia will expel 60 American diplomats and close the U.S. consulate in Saint Petersburg, the Kremlin announced Thursday — a severe escalation in tensions between the two superpowers that comes in response to the Trump administration's expulsion of Russians earlier this week.
The U.S-Russia expulsions — together, one of the largest since 1986 — threaten to uproot how the two countries have worked together in numerous delicate international situations, including the conflict in Syria and nuclear tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
The Russian Foreign Ministry announced the move Thursday, saying in a statement that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had summoned Jon Huntsman to notify him that Russia would be kicking out 58 employees of the U.S. embassy in Moscow and two of the U.S. consulate in Yekaterinburg — a tit-for-tat reaction to the U.S. decision to order Russian diplomats out over the poisoning of an ex-Russian spy in Britain.
The Russian Ministry also said that Lavrov told Hunstman he was shutting down the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg in direct retaliation for the American decision to close the Russian consulate in Seattle, leaving Moscow with no presence on the American West Coast.
Moscow's action appears to be disproportionate response: Saint Petersburg is the second-largest city in Russia and a popular tourist destination, and the U.S. consulate there is the oldest American mission in Russia.
Lavrov said Russia would be applying the same response to other nations that also expelled Russian diplomats this week.
""Based on the principle of reciprocity, in response, 58 employees of the US Embassy in Moscow and two employees of the U.S. Consulate General in Yekaterinburg were declared 'persona non grata' for activities incompatible with diplomatic status,"" Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Ryabkov said in the statement.
Ryabkov said the diplomats must leave by April 5 and that the consulate in Saint Petersburg must be closed by March 31.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a press briefing that the U.S. would not rule out responding further to Russia's latest action, signaling the possibility of a further escalation.
""We reserve the right to respond,"" she said.
On Monday, the U.S., the U.K., NATO and 25 other countries announced the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal in British that was allegedly orchestrated by the Kremlin.
The U.S. said it would dismiss 60 Russian diplomats identified by officials as intelligence officers, as well as close Russia's Seattle consulate. Twelve of those to be expelled were from the Russian mission to the UN, while 48 were from other places throughout the U.S. The individuals have one week since the announcement to leave.
In total, over two days, the U.S., U.K., NATO and the 27 other countries, including Georgia, previously part of the Soviet Union, expelled a total of 153 Russian diplomats in a show of solidarity with Britain.
These steps, a senior Trump administration official told reporters on the condition of anonymity Monday, were intended to let the Russian government know that ""when you attack our friends, you will face serious consequences.""
Removing these Russians, the official said, is also a bid to reduce the ""unacceptably numerous"" Russian intelligence officers who reside in the United States and spy on Americans.

President Donald Trump’s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, punched back at Jeb Bush early Thursday, slamming their dad’s former rival after he took a perceived shot at their relationship with their father.
Bush told an audience at Yale University on Wednesday that, following his exit from the 2016 presidential race after a loss in the GOP South Carolina primary, he “went home to my children that actually love me.”
His remarks were reported on by the Yale Daily News. The newspaper noted, in a correction, that Bush did not refer to Trump by name in that particular remark, but that several audience members interviewed said they had interpreted the comments as being directed at Trump. The paper also noted that Bush criticized Trump directly at other moments in the speech.
Trump’s sons, however, interpreted the dig as an attack on their bond with their father, and took to the president’s favorite platform to make their anger known.
“Jeb! I love everything about my father. I love that he’s a fighter, I love that he has guts, I love that he’s President (all those things you’re not),” tweeted Donald Trump Jr., before taking aim at Bush's campaign loss.
Jeb! I love everything about my father. I love that he’s a fighter, I love that he has guts, I love that he’s President (all those things you’re not)Also love that he learned enough about politics in a few weeks to dismantle you piece by piece despite it being your life’s work https://t.co/4fcnA1AgAa
Eric Trump also said he loved his father in a Twitter post, adding “#PleaseClap.” The hashtag references an infamous comment Bush had made on the campaign trail, pleading for an audience to clap for him.
.@JebBush I actually love my father very much. #PleaseClap https://t.co/YZGyUAlUNi
Donald Trump frequently targeted Bush during the presidential campaign, even bestowing the former Florida governor with the unflattering nickname “Low-energy Jeb.”

China has the power to usher in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula — and should take a leading role in doing so, even if that means eventually bringing about regime change, former Secretary of State James Baker told NBC News Wednesday in an exclusive interview.
Baker, who sat down with NBC's Andrea Mitchell for a wide-ranging discussion about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's recent trip to China and other topics, explained that a nuclear-armed Pyongyang is as bad for Beijing as it is for the U.S.
""What I'm struck by, really, frankly, Andrea, is that the United States and China both have a problem with the past behavior of North Korea and Kim Jong Un,"" he said. ""I mean, China's not happy with the idea that they're going to have a heavily nuclear-armed Korean Peninsula right there on their border. They don't want to see that. We don't want to see that.""
Baker, who served as secretary of state for President George H.W. Bush, as Treasury Secretary to President Ronald Reagan and Undersecretary of Commerce to President Gerald Ford, also said he would have preferred to see the U.S. work more closely with China ahead of Kim’s recent visit there.
""I think it's too bad that there wasn't some way that we could work with the Chinese to achieve this, this result of denuclearization of the peninsula,"" he said. ""China is the only country in the world that really has any influence, significant influence on North Korea.""
""We've seen the North Koreans talk a lot but not do anything constructive by way of reducing their missiles and development of nuclear weapons,"" he added, cautioning that a planned meeting between Kim and President Donald Trump is unlikely to yield tangible results.
Baker also noted the risk of a military option should talks fail, and said that he hopes the nations can find a diplomatic solution.
""If you fail here, then you better be prepared to know what your next step is going to be,"" Baker said. ""And everybody knows the cataclysmic consequences of a war on the Korean Peninsula in terms of loss of life, primarily Korean loss of life.""
Still, he said, China holds the key.
""I would have sent some high-level envoy to Xi Jinping, the president of China, that the Chinese trust and have confidence in. And I would have said, 'Look, you don't like what's going on in the Korean Peninsula. We don't like what's going on. Why don't we cooperate to stop it?'"" Baker told Mitchell.
“We, the United States, will support any government you install in North Korea, provided they repudiate the acquisition or maintenance of nuclear weapons. We will trade with that government, we will establish diplomatic relations, we will execute a peace treaty ending the Korean War,” he said, referring to what he would have told China. “Your job is to put a government in place there that is different than this government.""
""You’re talking about regime change,"" Mitchell said.
“Yeah, that’s what it would be,” Baker said, adding that at some point the question would come up if Kim doesn't change his behavior.
His remarks come just after state-run media in both China and North Korea reported that Kim had traveled to Beijing for talks with the Chinese President Xi, in what is believed to have been the dictator’s first foreign trip since he took power in 2011. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed on Tuesday that the Chinese government had contacted the White House to brief the administration on the visit.
That visit comes after Trump agreed, earlier this month, to meet with Kim, after the leader pledged to refrain from further nuclear tests and move toward denuclearization. Previously, the two men had traded increasingly tense barbs for months over North Korean missile tests and its nuclear program.

QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador's government is cutting off WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's communications outside the nation's London embassy.
Officials announced Wednesday they were taking the measure in response to Assange's recent activity on social media.
As part of an agreement between Assange and the Ecuadorean government, he is not permitted to send any messages that could interfere with the South American nation's relations with other countries.
Assange has been living in Ecuador's embassy for more than five years.
Ecuador gave Assange asylum after he sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden for investigation of sex-related claims. Sweden dropped the case, but Assange remains subject to arrest in Britain for jumping bail.
Though protected by Ecuador, the relationship between Assange and nation's leaders has at times been strained. Ecuador has repeatedly urged Assange not to interfere in the affairs of other countries following his frequent online comments on international issues.
The biggest crisis came in October 2016, when the embassy cut his internet service after WikiLeaks published a trove of emails from then-U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign.
He was also a point of contention in Ecuador's 2017 presidential election when Conservative candidate Guillermo Lasso pledged to evict the Australian within 30 days of taking office, while current President Lenin Moreno said he would allow him to stay. Assange later taunted after Lasso's loss that he would ""cordially invite Lasso to leave Ecuador within 30 days.""
Moreno issued a warning reminding Assange not to meddle in politics — he has also called Assange a hacker.

A former prosecutor with a background in medieval history will play a prominent role in President Donald Trump’s legal defense during the ongoing Russia probe, lawyers for the president confirmed Wednesday.
Andrew Ekonomou, 69, had been part of a small team of attorneys helping Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney for Trump, in his handling of matters regarding special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Ekonomou, however, will now play a more significant role on the team, Sekulow told NBC News Wednesday.
Ty Cobb, another top member of Trump’s legal team, told NBC News that Ekonomou has played a significant role throughout the process and that his role would increase following the departure of one of Trump's top attorneys, John Dowd, last week.
Cobb added that he had no personnel announcements to make regarding any new additions to Trump’s legal team.
News of Ekonomou’s elevation was first reported by Reuters.
The move comes amid turmoil and reshuffling in Trump’s legal team. Dowd's exit last week came just days after Trump hired Joseph diGenova — a longtime Washington lawyer and former U.S. attorney who has promoted a conspiracy theory that officials in the FBI and Justice Department are plotting to frame the president with a ""false crime.""
Then, on Sunday, Sekulow announced that Trump would no longer be adding diGenova, or another lawyer, Victoria Toensing, due to “conflicts.”
In the days since, Trump has been turned down by several lawyers, including, as NBC News reported Monday, Dan Webb and Tom Buchanan. Both cited business conflicts as the reason they could not represent the president. Trump tweeted Sunday that ""many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case.""
Ekonomou, a member of an Atlanta-based firm called Lambros Firm LLC, that handles civil and criminal racketeering cases for district attorneys around the state, worked at the U.S. Attorney’s office in Atlanta in the 1970s and 1980s as the head of the criminal division and briefly served as acting U.S. Attorney in 1982, Reuters reported.
He told Reuters that he went back to school following what he said was a ""mid-life crisis"" and earned a doctorate in medieval history at Emory University in 2000.
Ekonomou told the news agency that he is the author of a book on Byzantine Rome and the Greek popes.
He said he’d been working on Sekulow’s team since June, and contended he was qualified to help defend the President of the United States.
""I’ve been tested plenty of times,"" he told Reuters. ""Just because you’re not a Beltway lawyer doesn’t mean you don’t know what you’re doing.""
He said that, in his job at Atlanta, he’d prosecuted ""a lot of murders for the D.A,” but replied, ""that’s basically it, nothing earth shaking"" when he was asked if he’d worked on any big cases lately.

WASHINGTON — North Dakota ""could do a whole lot better"" than Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday at a private fundraising event for her Republican rival.
""Sen. Heitkamp voted no on tax cuts, no on repealing and replacing Obamacare, no on cracking down on sanctuary cities, no on repealing the anti-energy methane rule — she voted no on a 20-week abortion ban,"" Pence said, according to a person at the small gathering of political luminaries and donors in Fargo.
""I mean, it's time that North Dakota voted no on Heidi Heitkamp's re-election,"" the vice president added in support of her challenger, GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer.
With Republicans trying to maintain or expand their 51-49 majority in the Senate, North Dakota is one of their best pickup opportunities for the GOP in the country this year. Heitkamp won her seat by about 3,000 votes in 2012. And while President Donald Trump's presence isn't seen as a boon for many Republicans this year, he won North Dakota with 63 percent of the vote in 2016.
Speaking to a group that included oil tycoon Harold Hamm, Gov. Doug Burgum and Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., Pence framed the campaign as a contrast between a sitting senator who often opposes Trump and a challenger who marches in lock step with him.
To get Trump's policies enacted — from tax cuts to regulatory reductions and increased defense spending — ""the key to all of it is that we have partners"" in Congress, Pence said.
""North Dakota could do a whole lot better than Sen. Heidi Heitkamp,"" he said, according to the person in the room. ""Heidi's nice. I've got a great relationship with her. I'd just like her to have a little more free time.""
Pence said the North Dakota race is particularly high on Trump's priority list because Cramer was one of his earliest political supporters and has been one of his most loyal allies on Capitol Hill.
""We've got competitive Senate races all over the country, but I lost count of the number of times the president said to me, 'What about Kevin Cramer? Have you talked to Kevin Cramer lately?'"" Pence said, according to the person in the room. ""There's something about him from early on that just really connected with the president.""
And that's why North Dakotans can expect to see Trump in their state soon. ""I promise you the president of the United States will be back in North Dakota,"" Pence said.
Known for his message discipline, the vice president delivered remarks at a public appearance later in the day that were similar to those he gave behind closed doors.
""The truth is Heidi Heitkamp hasn't been putting North Dakota first, and I don't know about the rest of you, but I think the people of North Dakota deserve better,"" Pence said at the public event, which was staged by America First Policies, a tax-exempt group started by former Trump campaign and White House advisers to promote his agenda.
""It wasn't too long ago that Vice President Pence came to North Dakota and praised Heidi as a 'strong leader,' touting the 'great relationship' both he and President Trump have with her — and it sounds like not much has changed,"" said Heitkamp campaign spokeswoman Julia Krieger.
""That's because she's earned respect from both sides of the aisle by putting partisan politics aside and putting North Dakota first — standing up for working Americans by fighting against tax hikes and health insurance premium increases, protecting access to quality health care for seniors and families, and voting for President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. And she’ll keep working with Republicans, Democrats and with the White House — no matter who is in office — to get real results for North Dakota.""

WASHINGTON – Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Sunday said the president may not replace his chief of staff if John Kelly, who currently serves the role, were to leave the White House.
Instead, Lewandowski said, Trump could institute a staff structure similar to ones used by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter.
Trump has recently mused about the idea of life without someone in the role of chief of staff, where a handful of aides would instead report directly to him, NBC News reported this week. Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon agreed that the situation was possible in favor of a more free-flowing “Trump Tower” style approach with multiple top aides offering input.
“I think that's a scenario that could very well play out,” Lewandowski said on Sunday’s “Meet The Press.” “We know that John F. Kennedy didn't have a chief of staff his entire presidency. He had it for a period of time. Jimmy Carter to a lesser extent, the same thing.”
Lewandowski added that he sees Trump as a decision maker who “loves to have all the information brought to him.”
“I see him as the hub with a number of spokes coming out,” he said. “And candidly, and I'm not advocating for General Kelly to leave. I think he should stay. But if he were to go, I don't think there is one person who is the chosen one to step in and fill that role.”
Trump has already watched over numerous staff shakeups over the last few weeks, including the departures of National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, Communications Director Hope Hicks, and attorney John Dowd.
Lewandowski maintained that it’s the responsibility of staff members to leave if they aren’t on board with the president’s agenda.
""You can have a disagreement with the president,” he said. ""He wants to have conversations on all sides. But when the decision is made, you have to be on the team because the president is the final arbiter.”

WASHINGTON — Facebook has not been fully transparent with Congress about its recently revealed data leak, said Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, warning that government regulation of the social media giant may be in sight.
“I don’t think Facebook has been fully forthcoming,” Warner, D-Va., said Sunday on “Meet The Press.” “I called out Facebook back in December of ‘16. In the Spring of ’17 I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica. Early on for most of 2017 they blew that off.”
Facebook has been under increased pressure since news broke that Cambridge Analytica, a firm hired by the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, misused information from millions of Facebook users. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologized and promised a number of reforms, including audits of groups that harbor mass amount of information from their users. He also apologized in full-page ads printed in several major newspapers Sunday.
""All of these social media companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content,"" Warner said. ""I think we have to re-look at that. I think in many ways they’re media companies.”
Members of Trump's 2016 campaign have sought to downplay the role Cambridge Analtica played in their victory. Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, said Sunday he never approved their contact while working for Trump.
“They did not work for the campaign when I was the manager,” said Lewandowski, who led the campaign until June 20, 2016. “So we have to be clear about that. They pitched me three times, three times I said no. They did not come to the campaign until after I left.”
Facebook meanwhile has also faced deep scrutiny from lawmakers after it was revealed that Russians were able to purchase and disperse advertisements related to American politics on their platform.
“During the summer [Facebook] acknowledged there was paid advertising, but more importantly, that there were a number of Russian accounts that were fake accounts, spread information that touched 150 million Americans,” Warner added.
Russian use of social media to attempt to influence Americans has been one focus of the committee’s investigation into meddling into the 2016 election.
Zuckerberg has faced calls from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to appear before numerous committees, as well as calls to appear before other lawmakers elsewhere in the world. He told Recode this week he was “open” to testifying if he felt he was the appropriate person at the company.
Warner repeated his call on Sunday for Zuckerberg to appear before his committee.
""There are solutions, and what I invite Mr. Zuckerburg and others is come help work with us. Congress is not always at the best in terms of cutting-edge technology, they need to work with us so we can try to get it right,"" the senator added. ""I don’t want to out-regulate these companies into oblivion, but I do think people need to have the ability to know whether information they’re receiving is honest, truthful and or at least originates in this country.""

WASHINGTON — Status update on President Donald Trump's relationship with Republicans in politically competitive districts: It's complicated.
""I'll be all over the country,"" Trump promised Tuesday night at a National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee dinner that raised $32 million for the House GOP's midterm election effort. ""I'll be complaining every single trip, but I'm going to get there.""
And yet there are districts where Trump is neither welcome nor likely to show up. He is at once the most effective tool Republicans have for turning out their base voters and a political lightning rod who has set the table for Democratic gains in November.
Republicans will deploy him with care, using him to raise money and record robo-calls targeted to GOP voters in some districts while landing Air Force One for major public rallies in others.
""There’s no one-size-fits all approach,"" said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the NRCC. ""He obviously does have a really high approval rating among our base.""
Part of the difference is regional: Republicans are defending clusters of coastal-state districts in California, Florida, New Jersey, New York and other states where Trump may be more hindrance than help, but Democrats will have to win some interior-state districts where he is generally more popular to take control of the House.
That dichotomy can be seen in the 7th districts of New Jersey and Texas. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton by a little more than a percentage point in each of them. But the incumbent Republicans in those seats — Leonard Lance of New Jersey and John Culberson of Texas — have taken very different approaches to the question of what a Trump visit would mean for them.
""He lost the district by 3,800 votes in 2016, and I had the honor of winning the district by 38,000 votes,"" Lance said in the lobby outside the House chamber Thursday as he distanced himself from the president. ""I’ll be judged based upon my positions on public policy. As you may know, I didn’t vote for the health care bill and I did not vote for the tax bill.""
He said he neither expects nor wants Trump to lend a hand.
""I have never asked for help from national figures. I have always campaigned on my own and will do so again this year,"" he said, explaining why the president might not be as effective for him as for other Republicans. ""The district is different from certain Midwestern districts — it’s a classic East Coast suburban district.""
It's also different from the 7th District of Texas, where Culberson represents a portion of Houston and some of it's wealthiest suburbs — the difference between the district's mean household income ($114,506) and its median household income ($71,183) is the largest in the state.
Typically, the votes of suburban Republicans outweigh those of Democrats across the district. But their reluctance to back Trump in 2016 tipped the balance to Clinton in a longtime Republican stronghold.
Culberson, who won his own race with 56 percent of the vote in 2016, says the president has become more popular with his Republican constituents over time.
""President Trump has fulfilled every one of his campaign promises and made extraordinary progress in achieving his goals in his very first year in office,"" Culberson said in an interview with NBC News. ""There’s a lot of good things to talk about.""
Standing in a Capitol hallway Wednesday, he pulled out his smartphone and thumbed through open web browsers to land at a tally of the Republicans and Democrats who voted in the primary in his district earlier this month.
Though the Democratic primary was competitive, about 5,000 more people voted in the GOP primary. The key to his race, against the winner of a Democratic runoff between Laura Moser and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, is getting Republicans to the polls, he said.
That's where Trump can help.
""Vice President Pence, President Trump, I hope they come to Texas often and regularly,"" Culberson said. ""They would both be, I think, an asset to the entire Republican ticket.""
White House officials did not reply to requests for comment on this story.
Among Republicans, Trump's help is seen as having higher risk and higher potential reward than that of Pence, a far safer surrogate who can also help raise money and energize Republican voters without generating the same variety of headlines — and Democratic backlash — as Trump.
It's not just Republicans who think Trump's midterm appeal is a mixed bag.
""There are swing districts all over the country, and each district is pretty unique, so I don't know that there's a blanket answer,"" said Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus. ""Certainly there are groups that are more motivated to turn out and I think that's why we're seeing increased enthusiasm on the Democratic side. Will that happen in every swing district? I don't know.""
The early returns suggest that Republicans have a tightrope to walk in using Trump to rally GOP voters without sparking Democratic turnout.
In seven special House elections since Trump's victory, Democrats have gained between three points (in Utah's 3rd District( and 23 points (in Kansas's 4th District.) And, in a race unique because of allegations of sexual misconduct against Republican nominee Roy Moore — claims the candidate denied — Democrats won a December special Senate election in Alabama, a state where Trump had won by nearly 30 percentage points in 2016.
While the GOP narrowly lost the most recent special House election — held earlier this month in Pennsylvania's 18th District — some Republicans credit Trump's stretch-run visit with closing the gap between Democratic Rep.-elect Conor Lamb and Republican Rick Saccone.
Then again, the district, where Trump won by about 20 percentage points in 2016, was only competitive in the first place because Democrats were energized and unified by their opposition to the president.
Republican Rep. Pete King, who represents a safe district on Long Island, said his colleagues have to find ways to localize politics at a time when the national political environment isn't good for Republicans.
""Stress where you agree and where you disagree,"" King said. ""There's no magic formula.""

LOS ANGELES — Political leaders reacted mostly with expressions of respect as hundreds of thousands of Americans marched in favor of gun control on Saturday. But there was little sign that the politicians who currently oppose new limits on guns had changed their minds.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a staunch supporter of the National Rifle Association, acknowledged the peaceable intent of the students who led the March for Our Lives, which was a reaction to the shooting in which 17 people died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in his own state, in the town of Parkland. But he expressed doubt that the students were marching for anything useful.
Rubio today said via Twitter that he supported the young people’s right to march, but he also said many people see gun control legislation “as an infringement” of the Second Amendment and believe that more restrictions on firearms “won’t prevent shootings.”
“Protest is [a] good way of making a point, but making a change will require both sides finding common ground,"" he said.
Rubio also released a longer statement in which he characterized the goal of marchers as “a gun ban” that would not make a difference. He expressed support for “the Stop School Violence Act, improvements to our background check system, propelling CDC [Centers for Disease Control] studies on gun violence and now, a ban on bump stocks.”
He also advocated for taking guns “away from dangerous people.”
On Saturday a number of students at the Washington march, led by Parkland student Sarah Chadwick, wore $1.05 price tags. They calculated that Rubio has received $3,303,355 from the NRA, which comes out to $1.05 for each of Florida's estimated 3,140,167 students.
“Is that all we’re worth to these politicians?” Chadwick asked said during the rally.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a pro-gun Republican who has supported age limits on the purchase of rifles, said via Twitter today that he's ""proud of what we accomplished in Florida to make our schools safer."" He pointed to his signing of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, which seeks to strip weapons from the hands of those with demonstrated mental illness. But Scott opposes the more widespread bans on gun access supported by many of the speakers at Saturday's rallies.
President Donald Trump, a strong Second Amendment supporter, did not issue a tweet about the demonstrations, though he did use Twitter to send his ""thoughts and prayers"" to victims of a terror attack in France yesterday. The White House, however, released an official statement applauding ""the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.""
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has also opposed gun restrictions, did not respond formally to the march, though there was a demonstration outside his Houston office during which protesters chanted, ""Where's Ted Cruz? Where's Ted Cruz?""
Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tweeted that he ""might not agree"" with all the positions held by marchers, but he urged Americans to ""learn from them.""
""They're giving you an example of how to do something about the issues you care about,"" he wrote.
On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Twitter that hearing students speak today ""is a reminder of what is possible when our future is in the right hands.""
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, marched in Los Angeles and appeared to side solidly with gun-control advocates. ""We need background checks,"" she said as she walked. ""We need an assault weapons ban. And Congress needs to have the courage these kids have to act.”
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York estimated that 175,000 people took to the streets of his city. He tweeted: ""You have to know when a revolution is starting.""

WASHINGTON — Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment to allow for significant gun control legislation.
The 97-year-old Stevens says in an essay on The New York Times website that repeal would weaken the National Rifle Association's ability to ""block constructive gun control legislation.""
Stevens had previously called for changing the Second Amendment to permit gun control. He was on the losing end of a 2008 ruling in which the high court held that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own a gun for self-defense.
Stevens says the decision in that case, District of Columbia v. Heller, ""has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power."" Stevens retired from the court in 2010, after more than 35 years.

Stormy Daniels filed an amended lawsuit Monday that alleges Donald Trump's personal lawyer defamed her and violated campaign finance law by brokering a ""hush agreement"" just before the 2016 election.
The new filing in federal court in Los Angeles comes less than 24 hours after a television interview in which Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she had unprotected sex with Trump in 2006 and was later threatened for telling her story.
Clifford filed suit in state court earlier this month, arguing that the $130,000 hush agreement brokered by Cohen was invalid because Trump never signed it. Cohen, joined by Trump, then had the case moved to federal court with an eye toward pushing it into private arbitration.
The amended complaint alleges that Trump and Cohen ""aggressively sought to silence Ms. Clifford as part of an effort to avoid her telling the truth, thus helping to ensure he won the Presidential Election.""
It goes on to say, ""the Hush Agreement was entered with the illegal aim, design, and purpose of circumventing federal campaign finance law.""
In essence, the suit argues that the agreement was meant to keep a lid on information that could damage Trump at the polls and thus functioned as an unreported in-kind campaign contribution way beyond the limit for individual donors.
""Defendants plainly intended to prevent American voters from hearing Plaintiff [Clifford] speak about Mr. Trump,"" the suit says.
Cohen could not be immediately reached for comment on the amended suit, which mirrors the legal logic of a complaint previously filed with the Federal Election Commission by a watchdog group.
The White House denies allegations of an affair and any involvement in threats. ""The President doesn't believe that any of the claims Ms. Daniels made in the interview are accurate,"" spokesman Raj Shah said on Monday before the suit was filed.
Both the White House and Trump have sought to distance the president from the 2016 agreement and subsequent attempts to enforce it.
But Clifford's lawyer, Michael Avenatti, says a recent email — which he obtained and provided to NBC News — holds proof that Trump was involved.
Cohen sent the Feb. 22 email to Keith Davidson, the lawyer who represented Clifford when she signed the hush agreement.
""It is my understanding that Ms. Clifford has or is seeking the advice of additional counsel regarding the above matter,"" Cohen wrote.
The ""above matter"" was outlined in the subject line: ""PP -vs- DD NDA"" — shorthand for the agreement between ""Peggy Peterson"" and ""David Dennison,"" which Avenatti says are aliases for Clifford and Trump.
The email went on to say that an exhibit to the agreement that discloses their identities ""is deemed Attorneys Eyes Only; specifically naming only you and I.""
""Under no circumstances should you forward this document or the exhibits to anyone without my express written consent,"" Cohen added.
He signed the email: ""Michael D. Cohen, Esq., Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.""
Avenatti said the email also shows that ""as late as one month ago, Cohen was continuing to take steps to prevent my client from getting a new attorney to help her exercise her rights.""
And, he added, ""Cohen was acting as counsel to Mr. Trump when he was attempting to silence her.""

President Donald Trump will not be adding attorneys Joseph diGenova or Victoria Toensing to his legal team, despite announcing otherwise last week.
“The President is disappointed that conflicts prevent Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing from joining the President's Special Counsel legal team,"" Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement issued Sunday. ""However, those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the President in other legal matters. The President looks forward to working with them.""
The news was first reported Sunday by The New York Times.
Toensing and diGenova's hiring would have helped replace John Dowd, who served as Trump's lead counsel in the Russia probe until he resigned on Thursday.
Sekulow did not state specifically what conflicts the two lawyers faced. They head the Washington law firm diGenova & Toensing and are married.
NBC News, however, confirmed with Toensing that she is representing Mark Corallo, a former spokesman for the president's legal team who met with members of special counsel Robert Mueller's team for more than two hours on Feb. 15. Toensing declined to comment on what was discussed in the meeting with the special counsel.
According to The Times, Corallo planned to tell Mueller about his concerns that Hope Hicks may have obstructed justice when she said on a conference call with the president that potentially incriminating emails about a Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and a Kremlin-linked lawyer “will never get out.”
The president also did not feel a ""personal chemistry"" between himself and the two lawyers when they met recently, according to The Times.
Toensing also represents Sam Clovis, who was questioned by Mueller's team and testified before the investigating grand jury  late last year.
A former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, diGenova publicly pushed a conspiracy theory in January that the FBI and Justice Department officials were attempting to frame Trump with a ""false crime"" in the Russia investigation. DiGenova was working as a Fox News analyst at the time.
Sekulow confirmed diGenova's addition to the Trump's legal team last week.
""I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the president,"" Sekulow said in a statement at the time.
Trump did not comment on the topic, but he did claim over a pair of tweets posted Sunday that it is not ""hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.""
The social media posts included a signature: ""NO COLLUSION.""
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......
....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!

A spring hike is a great way to take advantage of the newly-warm weather. But it also comes with hazards like lingering snow, unpredictable downpours, and winter-damaged roads and trails. To prepare, you need to bring basic essentials like extra clothing, snacks and water, and first aid supplies. In order to hit the trail with even more confidence, we also recommend that you carry technological help: Download some extra apps and pack a few trusty gadgets. We've selected 10 pieces of spring-hiking tech that will guide you through the great, still-slightly-damp outdoors.
When you're deep in the woods, you can't exactly rely on Google Maps. Instead, download AllTrails (free for Android and iOS), an app with 50,000 maps of trails all over the world.
Once you've chosen a route, AllTrails will plot your progress on a map, display upcoming terrain, and track statistics like steps, distance, and elevation. It will even save this information so you can see how far you've traveled in a single day or across your entire hiking career. The app also boasts user community of hikers who share photos, advice, and reviews to help you research interesting trails in advance. And it wraps up all this guidance in a sharp-looking interface that's a pleasure to use.
The one downside to AllTrails is its reliance on a network connection—which can be pretty weak when you're actually out in the woods. If you want to download maps for offline access, or print them out, you'll need to pay for a Pro subscription, which costs $30 per year or a one-time fee of $100. The Pro account also includes the ability to create and save custom routes.
A portable version of the Amazon Echo, $100.
Amazon
How tall is the mountain you're climbing? What weather can you expect on your descent? If you rely on Alexa to answer questions like these, then bring the digital assistant with you on the Amazon Tap ($100 on Amazon), a portable version of the Echo smart speaker.
Alexa needs internet access, so the Tap will only work if you use a strong phone signal to set up internet tethering. Then the Tap will not only answer all your questions, but also connect to your device through Bluetooth. This will let you play podcasts or music, for up to nine hours, as you tramp along.
Think of Cairn (free for iOS only) as a hiking safety net. If you don't make it home on time, it will automatically ping a couple emergency contacts to let them know you're still out in the wilderness.
In addition to potentially saving your life, Cairn plots your route as you go and provides helpful information for your hike: topographical charts of potential paths, crowdsourced maps showing where cell reception is patchy, and estimates of how long various trails will take.
Like AllTrails, Cairn will only give you offline access to this information if you purchase a premium subscription, which costs $5 per month or $27 per year. That will also buy you the option to send live updates to your emergency contacts.
A versatile multitool, $35.
Amazon
On the trail, a blade has all kinds of uses—and a multitool has even more. We like the Victorinox Swiss Army Huntsman Pocket Knife ($35 on Amazon), which strikes a nice balance between functionality, bulk, and price.
The tool's 15 attachments can open bottles and cans, saw through wood, cut through paper, and perform other helpful tasks. It even has a pair of tweezers for removing that splinter that got stuck in your finger. When you're ready to put the pocket knife away, its attachments fold into a package just 3.5 by 0.8 inches, weighing a measly 3.4 ounces. This makes it the perfect size for tucking in your pocket—so you can always be prepared.
Before the rise of smartphones, you used to need a compass to navigate. These days, you can simply download an app like Spyglass ($6 for Android and iOS, with a free trial available on Android). It contains a digital compass and a full GPS toolkit, with a few neat augmented-reality tricks that give it a fantastic-looking display.
Spyglass really is one of those must-have hiking apps. The compass updates as you move your phone and progress along your route, showing you the way you need to go for the next few steps. It can also display a zoomed-out map with waypoints that you aim for to keep your journey on track.
On top of that, you get bonus features like measuring your distance traveled, speed, and altitude. Want to channel the days when sailors steered with sextants? Spyglass will help you navigate using the stars. To really put the app through its paces, check out the app developer's comprehensive user guide.
A sturdy smartwatch with all the bells and whistles, $620.
Amazon
For serious walkers—who also have a little (okay, a lot of) cash to spare—the Garmin Fenix 5X Sapphire ($620 on Amazon) is the smartwatch you need. Unlike some of the cheaper options on the market, it features solid on-board GPS. This can guide you to your destination even if your cell phone dies or you get stuck in a dead zone. And as you'd expect from the steep price, this watch is extremely well-built and capable of surviving the toughest weather.
Maps will pop up right on this watch. Like its competitors, it also lets you measure steps, distance traveled, and elevation, as well as other physical activities. And it can display notifications from your phone, allowing you to keep the larger screen in your backpack.
If you prefer to spend your time on a slope, Peakfinder AR ($5 for Android and iOS) will tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the mountain ahead of you. With more than 350,000 mounts in its database, the app will help you get your bearings or simply learn more about the valley you're traversing. It even works offline.
Just point your phone's camera at a peak, and the app will display information through augmented reality. This data includes the names of all the peaks on a range, as well as their locations and heights. Then the app converts this augmented view into a line drawing for easier reference. Want to check out a mountain that's just out of view? The app will let you ""fly"" over to peaks you can't actually see.
Backup power from sunlight, $40.
Amazon
The Kedron Solar Charger ($40 on Amazon) will draw on sunlight to make sure your gadgets have enough juice. Even if the sky threatens to be overcast, you can charge it in advance before you head out.
Smartphone batteries drain quickly when you're using the GPS, especially when you're traveling through an area with a poor signal. The Kedron device will make sure your phone stays powered up through the end of the day. The charger's 24,000mAh capacity will charge the average smartphone three or four times over. When you get home, built-in fast-charging technology will quickly restore its lost charge.
Although other hiking apps offer to map your route, for a dedicated option, try Map My Hike (free for Android and iOS). It measures how far you've traveled and plots your route on a map so you can review your hike once you're done. It also provides a detailed look at your progress, including steps, elevation gain, and average pace.
Map My Hike also includes a social side, letting you share walks and routes with friends. Add a premium subscription for $6 per month or $30 per year, and it will remove ads, and deliver you a personalized walking workout routine.
A lightweight drone, $550.
Amazon
To record your hike for posterity, bring a photo- and video-taking robot along with you. The DJI Spark drone ($550 on Amazon) will capture the scenery from above, and let you take the most dramatic of selfies.
Important for would-be hikers, the Spark weighs in at 1.5 pounds, so it won't drag down your backpack too much. It's also simple to operate, even for beginners—though do make sure you practice a bit before heading out.
As for its other specs, the Spark reaches a top speed of around 30 miles per hour and carries a 12 MP camera for those high-resolution snaps. It can only fly for 16 minutes between recharges, so if you plan to do a lot of filming, make sure to bring a spare battery.

DJI XT2 Camera
A new thermal camera is one of the first products users can integrate directly into the DJI M200 commercial drone.
DJI
DJI already has a pair of devices compatible with the new PSDK. The first is a thermal camera called the Zenmuse XT2, which it developed as part of its ongoing partnership with Flir. The camera itself has two imaging devices. One is a typical 4K camera, and the other has a radiometric thermal imager, which gives it the ability to effectively see heat.
The integration, however, goes beyond simply streaming two video feeds back to the user, and DJI has applied some of its consumer-style automated features. For example, you can use its QuickTrack mode to center the picture in a scene or switch to the thermal camera’s HeatTrack mode, which automatically follows the hottest object in its field of view. DJI touts it as a tool for firefighters who can get remote assistance from a pilot in real time, or someone monitoring conditions at a facility like a solar farm.
Zenmuse XT2
There's both a standard and thermal camera on the Zenmuse XT2, which pilots can monitor in real-time during a flight.
DJI
The other launch partner is agriculture tech company Slantrange. Its new 3PX sensor monitors a cadre of agri-specific variables like plant growth, soil conditions, and irrigation system performance. There are sensors that can provide this kind of information now, but this typically involves sending up a geotracker with its own heavy battery and without access to the drone’s internal GPS. Users can now also see the data from the sensor in real time on the flight controller, rather than waiting for the craft to come back and uploading it.
DJI Skyport
The coupling between the drone and the additional devices provides battery power and enables data transfer.
DJI
Drone maker DJI makes a lot of really fun, consumer-oriented flying machines. In fact, the company owns as much as 85 percent of the consumer UAV market, which makes them the leader in the category. The company’s most recent announcement, however, indicates that it’s increasing its efforts for commercial customers looking to employ unmanned flying machines for difficult, and often dangerous tasks like inspecting bridges and even fighting fires.
This week’s big announcement is the Payload Software Development kit, which is designed to allow third-party companies to integrate their tech directly into the M200 commercial drone on both a hardware and software level. Basically, DJI is turning its commercial flying machine into a more open platform that provides power, as well as real-time data delivery, for sensors like location trackers and thermal imaging devices.
On the hardware side, new gadgets attach to the gimbal on the bottom of the drone, which is an electronic stabilizing device meant to keep things like cameras and other sensors steady using gyroscopes, even during bumpy flights. The new Skyport adapter delivers power and transports data from any compatible device. This keeps users from having to send up extra batteries and transmitters, which add weight and shorten flight times.
Slantrange 3PX sensor
The 3PX array has multiple sensors to help commercial farmers monitor things like soil conditions and plant health.
Slantrange
Last year, Yuneec announced an SDK for its six-rotor commercial UAV, the H520. That drone has thermal capabilities as well, but that developer’s kit was strictly software-based, unlike DJI’s, which integrates third-party hardware.
If other drone companies want to catch up to DJI, they have a lot of ground to make up. Reports put the company’s total market share in North America at 50 percent, which includes the sub-$500 drone segment in which smaller, toy-like crafts do huge volume. DJI also just signed a deal with Japanese construction firm Komatsu to create a fleet of drones running a custom machine-learning software.
There’s no talk yet about whether or not this kind of software or hardware SDK could make its way to consumer drones, but it’s not hard to imagine a world in which companies use DJI as a platform for making after-market accessories. If Flir can make a thermal camera that works with a smartphone, adding it to a $1,000 drone doesn’t sound like much of a stretch.

Starting today and continuing on for the next week, Google is bringing Where’s Waldo? to Google Maps. On Android, iOS, and the desktop, you’ll see Waldo pop up in his signature red and white stripes and give you a friendly wave. From there, just tap or click on him and you’ll see the option to play a game that’s straight out of the classic children’s puzzle books. This is one of Google’s annual April Fools’ Day jokes, but the Maps integration is actually happening. 
Aside from Waldo himself, you’ll also be on the lookout for his friends Wenda, Woof, Wizard Whitebeard, and also the villainous Odlaw. (If you’re like me, those faces probably won’t be quite as familiar to you when you start playing.) 
Once you find Waldo, you’ll be “transported to places all around the world” to start the search again. There’s even a Google Assistant component to this campaign; you can ask “where’s Waldo?” on a Home speaker, Chromebook, or Android smartphone and... well, I’m not sure what happens, quite honestly. But Google says something does. 
This is the second time in less than a month that Google has incorporated a beloved brand into Maps for a limited time. In early March, users were able to replace the usual turn-by-turn navigation arrow with Nintendo’s Mario — inside a kart, of course. That was in celebration of Mario Day, but this time it seems like Google just wants to have a bit of April Fools’ Day fun and keep it going for the remainder of the week.

The New York International Auto Show opens to the public this weekend, and upon entering the Javits Center attendees will be bombarded with new cars, SUVs, trucks and even a handful of supercars that will most likely be out their price range. Here’s our primer for anyone who wants to cut through the noise and see the stuff that really matters.  
Anyone who grew up on dog-eared copies of Popular Science probably assumed we’d be riding around in self-driving cars while viewing the passing scenery through glass or plastic bubble roofs. The self-driving car part is playing out right now, but the glass or plastic bubble part seems to have been left in the recycling bin. Now, here’s the Genesis Essentia, an all-electric performance concept with a transparent hood and a fully retro-futuristic bubble roof. The Hyundai-owned luxury brand is certainly making a statement with its first EV. 
The news that Waymo would be adding up to 20,000 electric Jaguar I-Pace SUVs to its fleet of self-driving taxis threw a lot of people for a loop. I think The Verge’s enterprise editor Michael Zelenko summed it up best when he DM’d me, “jaguar?... it’s weird!” On the surface, yes kind of weird. Of all the cars Waymo could have chosen to operate alongside its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans, why the I-Pace? Since its debut in Geneva, car writers have sprained their wrists trying to find new and different ways to compare the I-Pace to Tesla’s Model X (see below). But before it could even hit the dealer lots, Jaguar has already made a multi-million-dollar deal with Waymo. The Alphabet company clearly is drawn to automakers with no autonomous vehicle program of their own, as we saw previously with Fiat Chrysler. We’ll know more in 2020, when these cars are expected to start racking up up to a million trips a day for Waymo’s soon-to-be-launched ride-hailing service. 
I think it’s safe to say that the Subaru Forester is probably the last car I would have expected to have something cutting edge like facial recognition technology. The Japanese automaker is known for its dependability and resale value, but hardly its embrace of buzzworthy tech. Which made it kind of surprising to hear that the new Forester would have a brand new feature for the brand called DriverFocus. Subaru describes it as a “driver monitoring system that uses facial recognition software to identify signs of driver fatigue or driver distraction.” The feature, which the automaker claims is the first in the segment, can recognize up to five drivers and can remember their pre-set preferences for seat position, climate, and infotainment. No details on which company is supplying Subaru with the biometric technology, but expect to see more automakers installing these kind of gizmos in their effort to reduce traffic accidents. 
It’s the unfortunate staple of auto shows that car companies feel compelled to produce live-action versions of their commercials when revealing their new models. Take Volkswagen: the German auto giant had four actors dressed as outdoorsy millennials drive its new Atlas Tanoak truck on stage and then take a selfie in front of it. One was wearing a fishing vest covered in hooks and lures. Another had a bike helmet, but no bike. I can’t say for sure, but they may have been the same actors who presented the Toyota FT-4X at the auto show last year. VW hasn’t said whether it plans on actually producing the Tanoak, so this bit of Kabuki theater may be the closest the truck gets to any millennials, real or fake. 
The Nissan Altima’s latest redesign includes an unexpected and welcome treat: ProPilot Assist, the automaker’s semi-autonomous driver assist system. Nissan hasn’t announced the Altima’s pricing yet, but it’s likely to start in the low-$20,000 range. Compare that to the Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise (around $71,300) or a Tesla Model S with Autopilot (around $77,500), and you can see why Nissan deserves your attention. It’s a separate question about whether ProPilot Assist can measure up to Super Cruise or Autopilot, both of which set the bar fairly high for driver assist systems. But Nissan’s commitment to making its technology available at a fraction of the price of those luxury automakers is a really big deal.
Cadillac’s new XT4 SUV has a lot going for it, but unfortunately its biggest drawback stems from something that’s missing: the automaker’s truly excellent Super Cruise advanced driver assist system. Cadillac doesn’t even offer the system on the CT6 V-Sport, also shown at this year’s show. While the V-Sport is more about power and a more aggressive personality, it’s also likely to be the most expensive version of the CT6. Shouldn’t that mean it gets all the options available on that car? A spokesperson said it was because of “packaging” issues that Super Cruise wasn’t available in either model, but that’s an unsatisfying answer. For a company that wants to be on the forefront of autonomy, GM is certainly being Scrooge-ish with its tech. 
Let’s be honest: there’s no sign that any other car company that’s making an EV right now has the same kind of cultural cache as Tesla. But this is the year where Tesla is going to start facing real, comparable competition in the space, and that all starts with the I-Pace. It’s fast, it’s got range, and it’s cheaper than anything Tesla sells. In Geneva, amongst a show full of wild concepts, the I-Pace almost felt intangible. But the electric SUV’s North American debut made the threat feel all the more real — especially because Jaguar also announced a team-up with Waymo to compete with companies like Tesla on reaching full autonomy.

The publication of a June 2016 memo describing the consequences of Facebook’s growth-at-all-costs triggered an emotional conversation at the company today. An internal post reacting to the memo found employees angry and heartbroken that their teammates were sharing internal company discussions with the media. Many called on the company to step up its war on leakers and hire employees with more “integrity.”
On Thursday evening, BuzzFeed published a memo from Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, a vice president at Facebook who currently leads its hardware efforts. In the memo, Bosworth says that the company’s core function is to connect people, despite consequences that he repeatedly called “ugly.” “That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices,” he wrote. “All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.”
Bosworth distanced himself from the memo, saying in a Twitter post that he hadn’t agreed with those words even when he wrote them. He was trying to galvanize a discussion around the company’s growth strategy, he said. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told BuzzFeed that he had not agreed with the sentiments in the post at the time, and that growth should not be a means to an end in itself. “We recognize that connecting people isn’t enough by itself. We also need to work to bring people closer together,” Zuckerberg said.
After publishing the memo, Bosworth deleted his original post. “While I won’t go quite as far as to call it a straw man, that post was definitely designed to provoke a response,” Bosworth wrote in a memo obtained by The Verge. “It served effectively as a call for people across the company to get involved in the debate about how we conduct ourselves amid the ever changing mores of the online community. The post was of no particular consequence in and of itself, it was the comments that were impressive. A conversation over the course of years that was alive and well even going into this week. 
“That conversation is now gone,” Bosworth continued. “And I won’t be the one to bring it back for fear it will be misunderstood by a broader population that doesn’t have full context on who we are and how we work.”
Facebook and Bosworth declined to comment. 
Nearly 3,000 employees had reacted to Bosworth’s memo when The Verge viewed it, responding with a mixture of likes, “sad,” and and “angry” reactions. Many employees rallied to Bosworth’s side, praising him for sharing his feelings about sensitive company matters using blunt language. 
Others criticized Bosworth for deleting the post, saying it fueled a narrative about the company that it had something to hide. “Deleting things usually looks bad in retrospect,” one wrote. “Please don’t feed the fire by giving these individuals more fuel (eg, Facebook execs deleting internal communications”). If we are no longer open and transparent, and instead lock-down and delete, then our culture is also destroyed — but by our own hand.”
Dozens of employees criticized the unknown leakers at the company. “Leakers, please resign instead of sabotaging the company,” one wrote in a comment under Bosworth’s post. Wrote another: “How fucking terrible that some irresponsible jerk decided he or she had some god complex that jeopardizes our inner culture and something that makes Facebook great?”
Several employees suggested Facebook attempt to screen employees for a high degree of “integrity” during the hiring process. “Although we all subconsciously look for signal on integrity in interviews, should we consider whether this needs to be formalized in the interview process?” one wrote.
Wrote another: “This is so disappointing, wonder if there is a way to hire for integrity. We are probably focusing on the intelligence part and getting smart people here who lack a moral compass and loyalty.” 
Other employees said it would be difficult to detect leakers before they acted. 
“I don’t think we’ve seen a huge internally leaked data breach, but I’ve always thought our ‘open but punitive’ stance was particularly vulnerable to suicide bombers,” one employee wrote “We would be foolish to think that we could adequately screen against them in a hiring process at our scale. … We have our representative share of sick people, drug addicts, wife beaters, and suicide bombers. Some of this cannot be mitigated by training. To me, this makes it just a matter of time.”
That employee followed up to say: “OMG, I just ran back to my ‘puter from a half-eaten lunch with food in my mouth. APOLOGIES to our brothers in sisters in the Austin Office for my insensitive choice of metaphors/words. I’m sorry.”
Another theory floated by multiple employees is that Facebook has been targeted by spies or state-level actors hoping to embarrass the company. “Keep in mind that leakers could be intentionally placed bad actors, not just employees making a one-off bad decision,” one wrote. “Thinking adversarially, if I wanted info from Facebook, the easiest path would be to get people hired into low-level employee or contract roles.” Another wrote: “Imagine that some percentage of leakers are spies for governments. A call to morals or problems of performance would be irrelevant in this case, because dissolution is the intent of those actors. If that’s our threat — and maybe it is, given the current political situation? — then is it even possible to build a system that defaults to open, but that is able to resist these bad actors (or do we need to redesign the system?)
Several employees shared concerns that the leaks had removed some of Facebook’s luster. The company is routinely cited as among the best places to work in America.
“If this leak #$%^ continues, we will become like every other company where people are hesitant to discuss broad-reaching, forward-looking ideas and thoughts, that only the very average ideas and thoughts get discussed and executed,” one employee wrote.” Making them average companies.”
Another employee responded: “Will become? Seems like we are there.”
The leaks also became cause for discussion about the company’s internal sharing tools. Facebook runs on its enterprise product, Facebook for Work. One employee wondered whether the critics of leakers had ignored incentives for sharing created by the product itself. It’s a nuanced thought worth sharing in full:
“It’s interesting to note that this discussion is about leaks pushing us to be more cognizant of our sharing decisions. The result is that we are incentivized toward stricter audience management and awareness of how our past internal posts may look when re-surfaced today. We blame a few ill-intentioned employees for this change. 
“The non-employee Facebook user base is also experiencing a similar shift: the move toward ephemeral and direct sharing results from realizing that social media posts that were shared broadly and are searchable forever can become a huge liability today. 
A key difference between the outside discussion and the internal discussion is that the outside blames the Facebook product for nudging people to make those broad sharing decisions years ago, whereas internally the focus is entirely on employees.” 
Another employee made a similar plea for empathy. “Can we channel our outrage over the mishandling of our information into an empathy for our users’ situation? Can the deletion of a post help us better understand #deletefacebook? How we encourage ourselves to remain open while acknowledging a world that doesn’t always respect the audience and intention fo that information might just be the key to it all. Maybe we should be dogfooding that?”
For his part, Bosworth promised employees he would continue sharing candid thoughts about Facebook, but said he would likely post less. “When posting comes with the risk that I’ll have to blow up my schedule and defend myself to the national press,” he wrote, “you can imagine it is an inhibitor.” 
Here is Bosworth’s full memo to the company today. 
I’m feeling a little heartbroken tonight.
I had multiple reporters reach out today with different stories containing leaks of internal information.
In response to one of the leaks I have chosen to delete a post I made a couple of years ago about our mission to connect people and the ways we grow. While I won’t go quite as far as to call it a straw man, that post was definitely designed to provoke a response. It served effectively as a call for people across the company to get involved in the debate about how we conduct ourselves amid the ever changing mores of the online community. The post was of no particular consequence in and of itself, it was the comments that were impressive. A conversation over the course of years that was alive and well even going into this week. 
That conversation is now gone. And I won’t be the one to bring it back for fear it will be misunderstood by a broader population that doesn’t have full context on who we are and how we work.
This is the very real cost of leaks. We had a sensitive topic that we could engage on openly and explore even bad ideas, even if just to eliminate them. If we have to live in fear that even our bad ideas will be exposed then  we won’t explore them or understand them as such, we won’t clearly label them as such, we run a much greater risk of stumbling on them later. Conversations go underground or don’t happen at all. And not only are we worse off for it, so are the people who use our products.

Tesla says Autopilot was engaged at the time of a deadly Model X crash that occurred March 23rd in Mountain View, California. The company posted a statement online late Friday, after local news reported that the victim had made several complaints to Tesla about the vehicle’s Autopilot technology prior to the crash in which he died. 
After recovering the logs from the crash site, Tesla acknowledged that Autopilot was on, with the adaptive cruise control follow distance set to a minimum. The company also said that the driver, identified as Apple engineer Wei “Walter” Huang, had his hands off the steering wheel and was not responding to warnings to re-take control. 
The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.
The investigation into the fatal #Tesla crash continued today with the #CHP & #NTSB digging through the scorched EV   https://t.co/rfdgY88bn7 pic.twitter.com/vd2YzFmAZ0
The driver of the car, Huang, was headed southbound on California’s Route 101 when his Model X crashed headfirst into the safety barrier section of a divider that separates the carpool lane from the off-ramp to the left. The front end of his SUV was ripped apart, the vehicle caught fire, and two other cars crashed into the rear end. Huang was removed from the vehicle by rescuers and brought to Stanford Hospital, where he died from injuries sustained in the crash, according to Mercury News. The National Traffic Safety Board (NTSB) has launched an investigation into the incident.
Tesla said the reason the crash was so severe was because the attenuator had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced. “We have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash,” the company said, echoing a comment it made earlier in the week.
In its statement, Tesla admits that Autopilot is an imperfect system, but argues its far better than the alternative. 
Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents – such a standard would be impossible – but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.
No one knows about the accidents that didn’t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars.
Huang’s death occurred less than a week after a self-driving Uber vehicle killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, sparking a national debate about the safety of autonomous cars. Tesla has faced questions about Autopilot before, when a Florida driver died from a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016. The NTSB found that Autopilot operated mostly as intended, but it “gave far more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving,” which contributed to the crash. The NTSB has also recently looked into a January 2018 accident where the driver of a Model S claims to have been using Autopilot when the car crashed into a fire truck.

Swift Playgrounds is a wonderful introduction to programming. It introduces imperative logic, functions, methods, loops, and many of the marvelous APIs that are available to iOS developers.
But it’s called a “playground” for a reason: you can’t make an app with Swift Playgrounds. You play with code, you learn about code, and you do indeed code. But if you want to build something useful and distributable, you need to look elsewhere.
Some popular options are Codea, which allows you to build full apps in Lua on your iPad; Pythonista, which offers a Python IDE and a number of popular libraries to work with; and of course there’s always the cloud.
But inside the Apple ecosystem, this “elsewhere” is called Xcode. It’s a huge and complicated application that runs only on Macs, and requires an Apple Developer account to effectively distribute the software you build.
I probably wouldn’t recommend a kid learn Swift as their first programming language, not because it’s not a great and interesting language, but because the barrier to distribution and the creation of useful software is so high. The Xcode cliff is a steep one.
For instance, here’s what writing for ARKit in Swift Playgrounds looks like. Mostly you’re dealing with a few pre-written one-liners and a highly ergonomic API:
In contrast, here’s Apple’s introduction for developers on making an ARKit app in Xcode. It’s nested within Apple’s overall application framework, deals with SceneKit, and isn’t scared to inform you that vector math exists.
Does it seem difficult and complicated to you? That’s not because Apple did a bad job on ARKit, it’s because most software is difficult and complicated. Software involving 3D graphics is, if I had to give a ballpark estimate, like, 3x as difficult.
The Swift Playgrounds fantasy of what ARKit is like is closer to an ad than a tutorial. I’ve actually worked on an app using Apple’s ARKit and SceneKit APIs directly. I got stuck when my API call to Apple’s sound playback system wouldn’t work, despite all my best efforts at debugging. Writing software with Apple’s APIs is a powerful but difficult practice, and Swift Playgrounds’ penchant for hiding true complexity makes it hard to recommend for someone who doesn’t want to just “learn how to code” but instead wants to build something.
Apple would do its learners a huge service by providing them an Xcode equivalent on the iPad. Not because it would suddenly be easy to make applications and release them on the App Store, but because it would give iPad-bound learners a chance to engage that challenge and grow into true application developers in time.
Compare this situation to JavaScript. Anyone with access to a web browser can write JavaScript, even write useful JavaScript, and distribute it to everyone in the world. Combine that JavaScript with a small knowledge of HTML and CSS and you have a website, which is kind of like an “app” except that almost any device in the world can access it, and you don’t need Apple’s permission to publish it.
Companies like Facebook and Google, and countless open source contributers, offer free JavaScript libraries (the equivalent, in many ways, to Apple’s platform APIs) to help expand your capabilities beyond simple “vanilla” JavaScript. The best libraries rise to the top, often due to superior documentation, which usually attempts to explain complexity, not hide it.
I’m not trying to denegrate apps or the iPad here. I love apps, and I love my iPad, and I use apps on my iPad all the time. Given a choice between a website and an app, I usually choose the app.
But apps breed dependence.
In the world of apps, if you have a problem you would like to solve, you search the App Store for the solution. A programmer’s approach is something like: I could write software to solve this problem. A user’s approach is more like: I could download and use software which solves this problem. Obviously, both approaches are valid and important — few, if any, programmers write all the software they use. But the user approach, if relied on entirely, is ultimately limiting.
I love Apple’s emphasis on education at its recent iPad announcement event. Obviously, Apple has a commercial interest in competing with Chromebooks for mind and marketshare in schools. But beyond the crass profit motive, learning is fun, and it’s beautiful, and it’s for everyone of all ages, and Apple’s unique perspective on using the iPad to make learning immersive and multisensory is great and laudable.
But you don’t just learn for the sake of learning. Learning is for doing, at least theoretically. And I’m worried that Apple’s penchant for safety rails, epitomized but not limited to the gap between Swift Playgrounds “learning” and Xcode “doing” seems stifling.
Here’s an illustration to help explain what I’m talking about: I wasn’t bad at math in high school. I generally understood the concepts on the blackboard. But my lack of attention to detail held me back in tests, and where my peers accelerated into calculus and beyond, I got stuck on advanced algebra concepts.
But math is so damn useful in the modern world. Want to write a video game? Oodles of math. Want to design complicated electronics? Hello, math. Want to crunch through numbers in a spreadsheet? Totes math. Want to understand advanced programming language theory? Welcome to math.
When I learned math, it was only learning, never doing. My only practical application of math was in a physics class, not a math class. But now I curse my ignorance every day. It holds back my understanding and utilization of so many things.
My fear is that a “learning” approach to coding, in absence of a “doing” application, will lead to students who get great grades at “programming” in school, instead of becoming great programmers in life.
Maybe this is just my generational blindness: most professional programmers alive today obviously got their start before Swift Playgrounds was a thing. They tinkered on the Commodore 64 as a kid, they hacked their TI-83 in school, they built websites in PHP to earn some spare cash. Maybe I’m romanticizing that struggle to learn, and should be more grateful for slick new learning experiences like Swift Playgrounds. Or maybe I’m super right. Hard to tell.
One of the most influential programmers in the world right now is Sebastian McKenzie. He started a project called 6to5 as a high schooler in a remote Australian town. 6to5, later renamed Babel, translates JavaScript written with modern features and modern syntax into JavaScript that can run on older browsers. Nowadays it’s almost a given that any new JavaScript project will rely on Babel in some way. Millions of developers use McKenzie’s code every day.
Sebastian started the project, in his own words, to “learn” more about JavaScript. Now he works for Facebook. Here’s one of the computers he got his start on:
I, for one, am grateful that Sebastian wasn’t “learning” on an iPad.

Apple has a Google problem — in education, that is. Google has won over a large portion of the education market in the US, something that can be credited to both the cheapness of web-based Chromebooks and the accessibility of Google’s apps. Apple knows this, so yesterday, it hosted a “field trip” — that’s actually what it was called — for press, teachers, and student journalists at a magnet high school in Chicago. 
The event may as well have been called “Sorry you can’t make a cool video with a Chromebook.” 
That’s the point Apple seemed to want to underscore as it presented another iPad and a new and slightly updated suite of apps for teachers and students. The new, $329 9.7-inch iPad ($299 for students) supports Apple’s fancy Pencil, as well as a new stylus from Logitech called Crayon. Need to scribble some notes or use a fine point to edit a photo? You can do that on a cheap iPad now. The school iPad also supports ARKit, which means it can run sophisticated AR apps. One example is an app that lets you dissect a virtual frog. (You don’t even need to Google “formaldehyde.”) And there’s a new Apple-designed curriculum called Everyone Can Create, which joins Everyone Can Code as part of a suite of apps for, well, making things: music, art, videos. 
Apple even cited examples of students using the Clips app to make videos. Never mind that I haven’t seen many real people using Clips in the past year, outside of people at Apple. 
“We’ve been at this for 40 years, and we care deeply about education,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said onstage at the event. “We believe that our place at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts makes it possible for us to create powerful products and tools that amplify ... creativity.”
There’s no question that Apple has a long history of appealing to creative types with its technology. The bigger question is whether that approach will help it grab some of the education market back from Google, which partners with a variety of manufacturers for Chromebooks and has emphasized the utility of apps like Docs and Gmail. 
Google’s occupation of classrooms has been a swift one. Last year, Chromebooks were estimated to have won half of the market share for personal computers and tablets in the US education market, up from a mere 9 percent in 2013. 
A large part of this is cost; Chromebooks sell for as low as $149. Another reason is device management. It’s pretty easy for teachers and students alike to sign in and out of web-based Chromebooks as needed, whereas Apple didn’t introduce multi-user features for iPads in classrooms until 2016. And Chromebooks run on Chrome OS, Google’s always-up-to-date operating system. 
But another big factor is Google’s software-centric approach. “Apple is fundamentally a hardware company, so they want people to fall in love with their devices and their user interface,” says Trace Urdan, a managing director at Tyton Partners who follows the knowledge and education market. “Google has been playing the long game, which is to get all of these kids into the Google apps. They’ve created enough utility and made it easy enough so it’s become the defacto document-sharing, collaboration tool in schools.” 
“Google’s goal is to get everyone into Google,” Urdan added. 
And it’s working: more than half of the students in primary schools and secondary schools in the US use Google apps like Gmail and Docs, which means more than 30 million kids use them. This is a number that was first shared in a New York Times report last spring; a Google spokesperson told The Verge that data is still accurate. 
Apple’s own collaboration apps and cloud-based features weren’t ignored at yesterday’s event. Apps like Pages, Keynote, Numbers, were all shown onstage and are getting fresh updates, along with Clips and GarageBand. A spokesperson confirmed that Apple’s new Schoolwork app, which lets teachers assign and manage homework and projects, will be easily accessible through the web at iCloud.com. And students will get 200GB of free iCloud storage. 
Apple also said that Schoolwork will keep all student data private.
But the overall theme of the event was about making things, not just writing them. After the main stage event, press and other attendees — who were given “class schedules” at the start of the day — were guided through robot-programming, music-making, anatomy-sketching demos in large garage-like rooms. Ditch the fuddy-duddy clamshell, Apple seemed to say, and use touchscreens and high-resolution tablet cameras and stylus pens instead. And it’s obviously an appeal the company is making not just to administrators and teachers, but to students themselves. 
“They are creators of content, rather than consumers of information,” Cassey Williams, a teacher from Woodberry Down Primary School in London, said about her students during the morning’s presentation. Williams was one of four teachers that Apple brought onstage to show how her students are using iPads in classrooms.
Of course, a lot of people still like laptops with keyboards. And when you’re a school district facing a giant deficit — as is the case for Chicago Public Schools, the district where the event was held — both upfront costs and operational costs for new technology are still a large consideration. Even with the student discount, Apple’s new iPad, keyboard, and stylus combo exceeds $400. 
But, Urban says, the tide could also turn in Apple’s favor as younger kids, who are quite literally growing up with iPads, get further into the education system.
“When you get up into the older grades, that’s where Chromebook comes on strong because then they have the ability to use the keyboard. But that’s not as much of a barrier anymore,” he says. “When you’re talking about little kids and educational content, you’re talking about videos and gaming and a market that extends from the school world into the consumer world.”

This morning, Trump once again tweeted about online retailer Amazon.com, alleging that it is scamming the United States Postal Service and that the agency should raise its shipping rates. He also says that The Washington Post — owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos —  should register as a lobbyist. 
Earlier this week, Axios reported that President Donald Trump wanted to take on Amazon. The President followed up with a tweet on March 29th, saying that Amazon was taking advantage of the USPS, paying little in state and local taxes, and putting retailers out of business.
The New York Times outlined earlier this week that Amazon has collected sales taxes since April 2017. The retailer reported $957 million in income taxes last year. The Times also lays out that while the USPS is losing money — it reported losses of $2.7 billion in 2017 — these losses are due in part to declining volumes of “marketing and first-class mail,” and the agency’s requirement to prefund the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund each year, which costs over $5 billion annually. 
Indeed, the growth in package shipping from retailers like Amazon have been beneficial to the agency, which “have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.” The Washington Post reports that officials have explained to the President that Amazon’s contracts with the USPS are profitable. 
While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that...
...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!
In his second tweet, the president says that the retailer is taking advantage of the USPS, saying that Amazon is scamming the agency. He cites a Citi Bank report (via the Times) which says that the agency’s rates are underpriced, and that price adjustments could bring in additional revenue of $2.6 billion each year. The Times notes that while Amazon does have a shipping arrangement with the USPS, the agency has reviewed the rates and found them to be profitable, and has said that said rates are competitive in the marketplace. 
The Post cites officials who say that Trump’s anger towards Amazon is a result of the paper’s coverage of his administration, and claims that it is acting as a lobbyist on behalf of Bezos. The Post says that while it is owned by the Amazon CEO, it operates independently of the retailer. We’ve reached out to Amazon for comment, and will update if we hear back.

If you’re anything like me, you’re sick of all these slick apps with their “high-resolution images” and “buttons that actually do things.” The terminal has what we crave: ASCII, unadorned URLs, and the complexities of managing a Python environment.
Well, Reddit user ghostreport, who goes by billcccheng on GitHub, finally has the answer: an Instagram news feed for the terminal. It has all that chaos and randomness of the regular Instagram news feed algorithm, except now it’s difficult to tell what the images are of because they’re in ASCII. Win, win!
Instagram Terminal Feed is written in Python, and fairly easy to set up — the steps are listed in the GitHub readme. You login with your Instagram credentials, it flashes a set of “images” at you, along with descriptions and the number of likes, and then it quits. It’s a brief experience, but it lasts about long enough for the joke to wear off.
If ASCII is too hardcore for you, there’s also now a --color flag you can pass (open source evolves fast!) that will attempt to render the images in color using huge blocky ASCII “pixels” (as demonstrated in the lead image of this post, which I believe is a rendition of the P20 Pro).
Instagram’s API is in a transition phase right now. Instagram seems to be mostly phasing out cool use cases like this in favor of a new Graph API for commercial users of Instagram — advertisers and media companies. Instagram says basic support for “non-business profiles” will arrive in 2019. Whatever happens, hopefully billcccheng will be there, making something useless out it.

ZTE is the first company to bring a smartphone running Android Go to the US. As spotted by Android Police, ZTE’s Tempo Go is now available to buy online for $79.99.
The phone is not much to look at. It has a 5-inch screen with a low, 480 x 854 resolution, big bezels, only 1GB of RAM, and a tiny 8GB of storage. But that’s all to be expected: Android Go is designed for phones with this kind of limited hardware. It takes up less space, and it runs better than normal Android would on phones with small amounts of RAM. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll run great, but it should improve the experience you’d get from buying such an inexpensive phone.
ZTE was one of the first six companies to announce phones running Android Go last month. While most of them aren’t destined for the US and are headed to India and parts of Africa, where the average selling price of smartphones is much lower, some companies are still testing the waters in the US, too. ZTE may be first, but Alcatel also announced plans to launch its first Android Go phone, the Alcatel 1X, for under $100 sometime soon.

Android Oreo is starting to arrive on some Galaxy Note 8s in the US. Reports from Droid Life indicate that some Note 8 owners with phones on AT&T and Verizon are beginning to see the update. Android Authority also spotted a few of its commenters saying they’d received the update on Sprint, as well. People on Reddit’s r/GalaxyNote8 community have also reported receiving the update on those three carriers.
The updates may not be completely widespread just yet. Phone carriers tend to roll out major software updates like this very slowly at first, to make sure that they can catch any problems early. Samsung, for instance, pulled an international Oreo update for the Galaxy S8 last month after it was found to be causing random restarts in some cases. It’s since fixed that issue and moved forward with the rollout.
There haven’t been any signs of Oreo appearing on T-Mobile just yet, but a T-Mobile product evangelist said this week the Oreo update should arrive “in just a few days.” A moderator on Samsung’s forums also said the company is working with carriers to get Oreo out to all phones “within the next 2-3 weeks.” So if you have a Note 8, the update should arrive soon.

Last June, Apple announced that it would add support for external GPUs to macOS. And now, just under a year later, official support has arrived. With the latest update to macOS High Sierra, you’ll be able to connect a number of different graphics cards to the Mac through a Thunderbolt 3 port and use that additional power to speed up demanding processes, including games and video editing. Apple has specifically highlighted its use for VR.
This probably shouldn’t surprise anyone since it’s Apple we’re talking about here, but there are a number of limitations around what you can do with external GPUs. For one, only select models are officially supported. And, surprise, Apple is only supporting some of AMD’s Radeon cards, which it already includes in select Macs. That doesn’t strictly mean a GeForce card won’t work — people have gotten some to work while the feature was in beta — but it means you’re gambling a bit around whether it’ll continue to work.
You also won’t be able to use external GPUs on Windows through Boot Camp. And just because you have an external GPU plugged into your computer when it’s running macOS doesn’t mean it’s going to be doing anything, either; developers have to enable support for it. Finally, you’ll also need to have a new enough Mac, since external GPUs rely on the super-fast speeds provided by Thunderbolt 3. That includes 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros, 2017 iMacs, and the iMac Pro.
Still, if you have a newer machine and are using apps that support it, this is a great feature addition and honestly kind of a surprising one from Apple, since external GPUs have really been popularized through the gaming community, which is nonexistent on the Mac. One of the big benefits of including Thunderbolt 3 ports is allowing this kind of powerful flexibility. And now, for those who are willing to spend several hundred extra dollars, they can get an even more capable computer than what they bought; that could be particularly useful for people with MacBook Pros who want a lighter package on the go and more power when they plug in at home or the office.

Google has banned the term “Kodi” from its autocomplete feature, meaning those who look for information on the controversial media playback software will have to type out the full term in order to search, as reported by TorrentFreak. Google has been increasing its anti-piracy efforts in recent years, banning terms from autocomplete and making changes to its search algorithms in order to demote copyright-infringing material.
While Kodi is legal software that can be installed in a set-top box for streaming, it supports a myriad of third-party add-ons that provide access to pirated media. Last year, Kodi was in the news after five people were arrested for selling fully loaded “Kodi boxes,” and shortly after, the European Union’s Court of Justice ruled that selling set-top boxes configured for easy film and TV piracy is illegal.
When “kod” is now typed into Google, suggestions appear like “kodiak” and “kodak black,” but “kodi” is not shown. However, once “kodi” is typed in with a space afterward, options like “kodi addons” and “kodi download” appear. Google has previously removed other piracy-related terms from autocomplete, like “pirate bay.”
The Kodi team, operated by the XBMC Foundation, actively tries to distance itself from piracy, issuing trademark takedown notices to those who sell piracy-configured Kodi boxes. But, while Kodi is legal software, it remains a space that enables piracy, akin to platforms like BitTorrent. (TorrentFreak notes that BitTorrent was previously removed from Google’s autocomplete, but later reinstated.)
“We are surprised and disappointed to discover Kodi has been removed from autocomplete as Kodi is perfectly legal open source software,” XBMC Foundation president Nathan Betzen told TorrentFreak. Meanwhile, a Google spokesperson told TorrentFreak that “Since 2011, we have been filtering certain terms closely associated with copyright infringement from Google Autocomplete. This action is consistent with that long-standing strategy.”
Correction March 30th, 2018, 1:20AM ET: Article updated to be clear that Kodi is software sometimes loaded onto set-top boxes, not a set-top box.

German automation company Festo has a history of making kooky robotic versions of wildlife. It has previously constructed a kangaroo, an elephant trunk, and ants, and now, it has come up with a walking, rolling robot spider as well as a robotic flying fox, as spotted by IEEE Spectrum.
If the idea of a rolling spider seems terrible, let me cement your fears and assure you this robot is based on the very real flic-flac spider, which lives in the Sahara and escapes predators with cartwheels and flips. Bionics professor Ingo Rechenberg, who discovered the flic-flac spider, was involved in helping to design Festo’s version. It has eight legs which are controlled by 15 motors within the knee joints and body. When it rolls, it does a somersault with its whole body, tucking in six of the legs and using the remaining two to push off the ground with every rotation. Thanks to an integrated inertial sensor, the robot knows its position and when to push while rolling.
Festo has also created a bionic flying fox, something that required some out-of-the-box thinking when it came to creating the wings. “The model’s flying membrane is wafer-thin and ultralight whilst also robust,” says Festo. “It consists of two airtight films and a knitted elastane fabric, which are welded together at approximately 45,000 points. Due to its elasticity, it stays almost uncreased, even when the wings are retracted. The fabric’s honeycomb structure prevents small cracks in the flying membrane from getting bigger. This means that the BionicFlyingFox can continue flying even if the fabric sustains minor damage.” The flying fox can move semi-autonomously in a defined space by communicating with a motion-tracking system that constantly records its position.
Like Boston Dynamics’ SpotMini, these types of robots exist not just to terrify and delight, but to test out navigating complex situations — whether it's opening a door, crossing rocky terrain, or learning efficient flight paths. That said, I never want to think about a spider doing acrobatics toward me ever again.

iPhone users at more than 100 hospitals and clinics in the US can now access parts of their medical records through the Health app, Apple announced today. The Health Records section of the app debuted in January with the iOS 11.3 beta, and today’s update makes it available to everyone who updates their phone to the latest version. 
The medical information — such as allergies, medical conditions, vaccinations, lab tests, medical procedures, and vitals — will be available to iPhone users who are patients at 39 health systems that are working with Apple, including Stanford Medicine and Johns Hopkins. Before the update, the medical records section of the app was only available to the people who had signed up to test a pre-release version.
Providing patients with a way to easily see their medical records gives them somewhat better control over their health information, which can stay stuck in the silos of individual health systems. Some healthcare groups — like Kaiser, for example — already offer patients a way to look at their medical records from their mobile devices or desktop. The idea here with Apple is that multiple systems are collected into a single app. 
Ready access to medical records might also help patients catch potentially dangerous mistakes. If their weight is recorded incorrectly, for example, it could lead to patients receiving the wrong dosages of medications. Poorly designed electronic health records, or EHRs, have been linked to medical errors, according to a recent study.

Silkworms have had their genetic code hacked, allowing them to create a new kind of silk not found in nature. The hacking goes beyond the usual forms of genetic modification, by fundamentally altering the nature of the silk protein the animal makes. And unlike previous attempts at this, it will work on an industrial scale.
“The silkworm is the first ever industrially useful animal engineered to incorporate synthetic amino acids,” says Hidetoshi Teramoto of the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization …

Maybe we should stick to our own echo chambers after all. People forced to pop their social media bubbles were more likely to strengthen their political beliefs than soften them, according to a new study.
Over the course of a month, a team from Duke University, New York University, and Princeton got regular Republican Twitter users to follow a bot that retweeted tweets from Democrat politicians, pundits and journalists, and vice versa for Democrat Twitter users. More than one thousand people took part.

The team measured the political leanings of the participants before and after the trial. They were asked to rate how much they agreed with statements such as “government is almost always wasteful and inefficient” and “homosexuality should be accepted by society”. Rather than becoming sympathetic to ideas retweeted by the bots, their views became more entrenched. Overall, after leaving their echo chambers, Republicans became substantially more conservative, and Democrats became slightly more liberal.
The results have lessons for those who want to reduce polarised views. “Well intentioned attempts to introduce people to opposing political views on social media might not only be ineffective, but counter-productive,” said the team in the paper.
The study also suggests that though a simple Twitter bot couldn’t drastically alter people’s views, it could still influence them by making them stronger.
Just showing content from the other end of the political spectrum to a partisan voter won’t mean they will automatically soften their beliefs, says Javier Sajuria at Queen Mary University in London. “This paper seems to support that not all exposure to diverse views is good. Some can produce acceptance to these views, but others can produce backlash,” he says.

Crimes carried out online are already illegal, so politicians should stop calling for new laws and start enforcing the old ones

OVER the past few years, crime statistics in England and Wales have risen dramatically, following decades of steady decline. According to the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), crimes have near-doubled since 2015.
It’s not that there has been a recent crime spree – this isn’t about a rise in acid attacks or knife crime. Rather, it was only in 2016 that the ONS began estimating cybercrime figures, exposing how criminal operations are increasingly moving online. After all, why rob a bank when you could hack someone’s account or steal their bitcoins?
The ONS says …

Amazon ran a commercial on this year’s Super Bowl that pretended its digital assistant Alexa had temporarily lost her voice. It featured celebrities like Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and even the company’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.
While the ad riffed on what Alexa can say to users, the more intriguing question may be what she and other digital assistants can hear — especially as more people bring smart speakers into their homes.
Amazon and Google, the leading sellers of such devices, say the assistants record and process audio only after users trigger them by pushing a button or uttering a phrase like “Hey, Alexa” or “O.K., Google.” But each company has filed patent applications, many of them still under consideration, that outline an array of possibilities for how devices like these could monitor more of what users say and do. That information could then be used to identify a person’s desires or interests, which could be mined for ads and product recommendations.
In one set of patent applications, Amazon describes how a “voice sniffer algorithm” could be used on an array of devices, like tablets and e-book readers, to analyze audio almost in real time when it hears words like “love,” bought” or “dislike.” A diagram included with the application illustrated how a phone call between two friends could result in one receiving an offer for the San Diego Zoo and the other seeing an ad for a Wine of the Month Club membership.

Some patent applications from Google, which also owns the smart home product maker Nest Labs, describe how audio and visual signals could be used in the context of elaborate smart home setups.
Advertisement
One application details how audio monitoring could help detect that a child is engaging in “mischief” at home by first using speech patterns and pitch to identify a child’s presence, one filing said. A device could then try to sense movement while listening for whispers or silence, and even program a smart speaker to “provide a verbal warning.”
A separate application regarding personalizing content for people while respecting their privacy noted that voices could be used to determine a speaker’s mood using the “volume of the user’s voice, detected breathing rate, crying and so forth,” and medical condition “based on detected coughing, sneezing and so forth.”
The same application outlines how a device could “recognize a T-shirt on a floor of the user’s closet” bearing Will Smith’s face and combine that with a browser history that shows searches for Mr. Smith “to provide a movie recommendation that displays, ‘You seem to like Will Smith. His new movie is playing in a theater near you.’”
In a statement, Amazon said the company took “privacy seriously” and did “not use customers’ voice recordings for targeted advertising.” Amazon said that it filed “a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology,” and that they “take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.”
Google said it did not “use raw audio to extrapolate moods, medical conditions or demographic information.” The company added, “All devices that come with the Google Assistant, including Google Home, are designed with user privacy in mind.”
Tech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year, many of which are never used and are years from even being possible.
Still, Jamie Court, the president of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group in Santa Monica, Calif., which published a study of some of the patent applications in December, said, “When you read parts of the applications, it’s really clear that this is spyware and a surveillance system meant to serve you up to advertisers.”
The companies, Mr. Court added, are “basically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways.”

Google called Consumer Watchdog’s claims “unfounded,” and said, “Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications.”
A recent Gallup poll found that 22 percent of Americans used devices like Google Home or Amazon Echo. The growing adoption of smart speakers means that gadgets, some of which contain up to eight microphones and a camera, are being placed in kitchens and bedrooms and used to answer questions, control appliances and make phone calls. Apple recently introduced its own version, called the HomePod.

But many consumers are also becoming increasingly nervous that tech companies are eavesdropping on them in order to serve them targeted ads, no matter how often the companies deny it. The recent revelations that a British political data firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users has only added to the public’s wariness over the collection and use of personal information.
Facebook, in fact, had planned to unveil its new internet-connected home products at a developer conference in May, according to Bloomberg News, which reported that the company had scuttled that idea partly in response to the recent fallout.
Both Amazon and Google have emphasized that devices with Alexa and Google Assistant store voice recordings from users only after they are intentionally triggered. Amazon’s Echo and its newer smart speakers with screens use lights to show when they are streaming audio to the cloud, and consumers can view and delete their recordings on the Alexa smartphone app or on Amazon’s website (though they are warned online that “may degrade” their experience). Google Home also has a light that indicates when it is recording, and users can similarly see and delete that audio online.
Amazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services, while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better, more personalized responses.
But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving.
Take the thousands of third-party apps developed for Alexa called “skills,” which can be used to play games, dim lights or provide cleaning advice. While Amazon said it didn’t share users’ actual recordings with third parties, its terms of use for Alexa say it may share the content of their requests or information like their ZIP codes. Google says  it will “generally” not provide audio recordings to third-party service providers, but may send transcriptions of what people say.
And some devices have already shown that they are capable of recording more than what users expect. Google faced some embarrassment last fall when a batch of Google Home Minis that it distributed at company events and to journalists were almost constantly recording.
Advertisement
In a starker example, detectives investigating a death at an Arkansas home sought access to audio on an Echo device in 2016. Amazon resisted, but the recordings were ultimately shared with the permission of the defendant, James Bates. (A judge later dismissed Mr. Bates’s first-degree murder charge based on separate evidence.)
Kathleen Zellner, his lawyer, said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to. Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.
“It was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,” Ms. Zellner said.
The Electronic Privacy Information Center has recommended more robust disclosure rules for internet-connected devices, including an “algorithmic transparency requirement” that would help people understand how their data was being used and what automated decisions were then being made about them.
Sam Lester, the center’s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.
“A lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,” he said. “But it’s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it’s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs. It’s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago.”
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos’s role in Amazon’s Super Bowl ad. He was trying to figure out what to do when Alexa lost her voice; he did not fill in for her.

Back in Spotify’s early days, when the company was just a dozen people in a small office in Stockholm, Daniel Ek, a co-founder, liked to compare it to Apple and Google.
It was 2008, and the traditional music industry was collapsing. Yet as Spotify introduced its streaming service in a handful of European countries, it clung to what must have seemed an impossible ambition: challenging the titans of Silicon Valley to become the world’s leading outlet for online music, with a hybrid free-and-paid model that made record companies nervous.
After a decade, the start-up from Sweden has proved itself a worthy adversary, with 157 million users around the world, 71 million of whom pay for subscriptions. That is about twice the number of its closest competitor, Apple, which finally entered the subscription game three years ago.
And on Tuesday, in a ritual of success for any start-up, Spotify’s shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a valuation that could exceed $20 billion. Underscoring the company’s self-image as a disrupter, it has shunned the usual circus of an initial public offering in favor of a rarely used — and potentially risky — process known as a direct listing, in which no new stock is issued and insiders can begin selling their stash on Day 1.
Advertisement
Spotify’s path ahead, though, is far from clear. The company has never turned a profit. Its direct listing could backfire, spooking investors. Its competition is still a field of giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. And Spotify’s relationship with the music industry, which it relies on for the millions of songs it makes available for streaming, has been fraught since the beginning.
Advertisement
“I don’t believe the industry would have embraced subscription without Daniel’s persistence,” said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. “If it were up to the labels, he would have failed years ago.”
In its defense, Spotify can point to its role in music’s financial turnaround. After a 15-year decline that made the industry a cautionary tale for all legacy media in the internet age, revenues from recorded music began to improve sharply around 2015. Last year, revenues — which include sales from CDs, downloads and subscriptions to services like Spotify — in the United States grew to $8.7 billion, their highest level in a decade, with streaming accounting for 65 percent of the total, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

            Each song streamed on Spotify is worth a fraction of a cent, and the ultimate payday for artists is as dependent on their record deal as on their stream count. This summary, based on figures from 2016, examines the path of a hypothetical dollar as it makes its way to three types of artists.        
A major-label artist has the best chance of finding an audience, but gets the smallest share.

Spotify predicts that by the end of 2018, it will have up to 96 million subscribers and $6.5 billion in revenue, according to a recent filing.
But Spotify’s revolution has been about more than numbers. Streaming has also brought about a shift in the business itself, transforming its underlying financial model and rewriting the rules for how hits are made.
In a sense, it has even changed the conception of music as a product. With streaming, a song is not a discrete item to be paid for and kept — like a CD or a download — but one part of a vast pool of music that listeners can access with a click. By design, it’s not too different from what the millennial generation had grown accustomed to through pirate sites like Napster and Grokster.
“It all worked because we recognized the consumer behavior,” Mr. Ek said at an investor presentation last month. “Fans wanted all the world’s music for free, immediately. So what we did was build a better experience.”
Mr. Ek and Martin Lorentzon, a Swedish investor, founded Spotify in 2006. Their service was built in part to mimic the experience of piracy — for years it used a peer-to-peer network to help songs play instantly — while operating legally and paying royalties.

“Music was too important to me to let piracy take down the industry,” Mr. Ek wrote in a letter included in Spotify’s investor prospectus. The company declined to comment for this article, citing a quiet period before the public listing.
At first, Spotify was conceived of as a free, advertising-supported service. But realizing that record companies and music publishers would be more willing to grant licenses if Spotify also had a paid level, Mr. Ek and his team developed the so-called freemium model. Users can listen to any song free with advertising, or pay $10 a month to remove the ads and get perks like offline listening.
The free service is meant to lure customers to pay; according to Spotify, 60 percent of new subscribers begin as free users.
Music executives involved in Spotify’s early licensing negotiations were impressed by the company’s technology, and by its approach: Unlike other music tech start-ups at the time, most of which no longer exist, Spotify presented itself as a partner that could help the industry recover.
Still, the idea of simply giving music away was worrisome. So as a condition of granting licenses, the major record labels and Merlin, an organization that represents independent labels, received equity stakes in Spotify that are now worth billions of dollars. They have all said they will share with artists any profits from the sale of those stakes, although exactly how that will work remains unclear.
Once Spotify took hold — it came to the United States in 2011, after protracted talks — record companies discovered that its subscriptions delivered steadily recurring income, a relief from the industry’s seasonal ups and downs.

“Once you get someone in, you take away the unpredictable cycles we used to see,” said Ole Obermann, the chief digital officer at the Warner Music Group. “For most months of the year, we’d be behind and then count on a huge spike of sales around the holidays to make us profitable for the year.”
With the cost barrier to listening removed, consumer behavior began to change. Independent labels said their music was being listened to more. Playlists, programmed with a mixture of editorial supervision and machine learning, began to influence what people heard; according to Spotify, 31 percent of its listening now happens through its playlists.
Yet even Spotify’s biggest champions in the music industry, like Daniel Glass of the label Glassnote, notice that streaming and social media created a network effect that emphasized hit songs above everything else.

“I remember sitting down with managers and artists and explaining that they will get paid; streaming is the future, whether you like it or not,” said Mr. Glass, whose label catalog includes Childish Gambino and Mumford & Sons. “But you’ve got to have hits.”
Spotify says its mission is to “unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art.” But its dealings with artists are still delicate. An elite level of superstars like Taylor Swift and Adele have realized that they can still sell millions of CDs if they withhold their music from streaming, at least for a while. (Plenty of other stars, like Ed Sheeran and Drake, have embraced the format fully.)
And many who are not household names, from independent musicians to major songwriters, say the complex economics — each click is worth just a fraction of a penny, to be divided among Spotify, labels, publishers and, finally, artists and songwriters — make it impossible for anyone other than a pop star to make a living from streaming.
“The streaming model as it stands now is fundamentally stacked against middle-class artists and emerging artists,” said Blake Morgan, an independent musician and a label owner who has been an outspoken critic of Spotify and Pandora, another streaming service. “Ninety percent of the revenue is going to 1 percent of the artists.”
Tensions have also developed with the major record labels, which fear that as Spotify grows more powerful it will start to exert more influence over artists. One possibility, hinted at in Spotify’s prospectus, is that the company will want to work more closely with artists, in a way that might circumvent record labels, said Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst with Midia Research.
“Spotify has to communicate that they are the labels’ No. 1 partner, there to help artists and labels find success,” he said. “But at the same time, they present themselves as part of a future which they imply doesn’t necessarily include record labels.”
But can Spotify itself make money? It has had $2.8 billion in net losses in just the last five years, and pays most of its revenue to music rights holders. The company’s freemium model means that it must subsidize the costs of the tens of millions of users who don’t pay.
“Becoming the world’s largest global music-streaming subscription service has been expensive,” Barry McCarthy, Spotify’s chief financial officer, said in the company’s recent investor presentation. (Mr. McCarthy is a former finance chief of Netflix, an association he mentioned several times.)

Spotify has a clear path to profitability, Mr. McCarthy said, pointing out that while it has continued to lose money, its operating losses have decreased as a percentage of revenue, and its free cash flow has grown to become positive for the last two years.
Still, he said that for the foreseeable future, Spotify would continue to make investments to promote growth — at the expense of profits. Spotify’s stock price may depend on how long Wall Street will remain patient with that strategy.
Mr. Glass of the Glassnote label said he never had any doubts about the freemium model. Free samples, he said, are good for business, recalling working at his uncle’s luncheonette in Brooklyn as a teenager.
“All the good customers — even the new customers — he would give them free samples of the day’s specials,” Mr. Glass said. “ ‘We’re having brisket today.’ ‘Have some coleslaw.’”
“They came back and ordered more. Spent more money.”

The recent cyberattack on Atlanta, in which the municipal government’s computers and related services were held hostage by a ransomware attack, is a reminder that local governments are particularly vulnerable to these and other cyberthreats.
Local governments of all sizes and locations now own and operate a wide and growing array of internet-connected technology systems: employee-issued laptops, motion sensors on light poles and under pavement, mapping and informational systems inside police cars, online citizen-engagement tools and much more.
Most local governments in the United States don’t have a strong grasp of the policies and procedures they should implement to protect their technology systems from attacks. This is especially concerning because the threat of a cyberattack is the most important cybersecurity problem they face, according to a survey conducted by the organization I work for, the International City/County Management Association, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Forty-four percent of local governments report that they regularly face cyberattacks, on either an hourly or daily basis. More troubling is the high percentage of governments that do not know how often they are attacked (28 percent) or breached (41 percent). Further, a majority of local governments do not catalog or count attacks (54 percent).
This is not just an American problem. Last month, at a conference in Tel Aviv, Tamir Pardo, the former head of Mossad, Israel’s national intelligence agency, said that most local government leaders around the world do not fully understand how serious a threat cyberattacks are and have not imaginatively assessed the consequences of inaction. He described cyberthreats as “soft nuclear weapons” that one day may be used to start and finish a war without firing a shot.
So what should local governments do to improve their cybersecurity apparatus to help prevent or mitigate damage from future attacks like the one experienced in Atlanta, or from those contemplated by Mr. Pardo?
First, local leaders must create a culture of cybersecurity that imagines worst-case scenarios and explores a range of solutions to mitigate threats to the ecosystem of local government technology. This should involve prioritizing funding for cybersecurity, establishing stronger cybersecurity policies and training employees in cybersecurity protocols. Success will require collaboration with local elected officials, internet-technology and cybersecurity staff members, department managers and end users.
Cybersecurity is more than just the I.T. department’s problem. It must now also be a top priority along the entire chain of elected and appointed officials in and around local governments. Preventing and mitigating the effects of future attacks will require intergovernmental cooperation, because localities work together across state lines and collaborate with the federal government on crucial tasks like running elections, managing transportation and sharing intelligence.
Most technological advances are transforming local governments for the better, moving them from inefficient and costly paper systems to digital systems that allow for better analysis and understanding of policy decisions. The science of analytics and big data promises even greater leaps for local governments in evidence-based policymaking. These exciting developments may one day radically alter the ways that traditional local government services are financed, operated and managed.
But we cannot get lost in the excitement. We must actively prepare for cyberthreats of the sort that have been demonstrated in places like Atlanta. If smart cities and communities are the brightly lit days of the increasingly connected world of local government technology, cyberattacks are the dark and stormy nights. We don’t need to halt technological deployments and evolution, but we do need to recognize that cybersecurity is an essential counterpart.

Just a year ago, Tesla looked like a rising force destined to revolutionize the auto industry.
Its battery-powered Model S sedan was the rage among luxury-car buyers. Its Autopilot system seemed far ahead of its competitors in self-driving technology. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, was promising that the more affordable Model 3 would soon roll off its assembly line and bring emission-free driving to the masses.
Wall Street was enraptured. Tesla’s market value rose to surpass that of either General Motors or Ford, car companies with a century of experience.
What a rough ride it’s been since then.
Not only has the Model 3’s introduction been mired in glitches and delays — “manufacturing hell,” as Mr. Musk put it — but Tesla’s driverless efforts have been overshadowed, and the company has continued to lose money quarter after quarter.
In just the past week, Tesla’s troubles have intensified. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the company’s credit rating, concerned that it was burning through cash. Those worries have grown so dire that some analysts are asking whether the company could run out of money by the end of the year.
Advertisement
“I’ve said for some time that Tesla is far from a sure bet, or a stable company for that matter,” said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at Investing.com. “Tesla has been living on borrowed time and money for quite some time.”
Advertisement
Tesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.
Reflecting questions about Tesla’s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.
A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company’s finances.
But the company’s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)
And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.
Tesla’s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world’s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.
For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.
In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

“There is a huge part of Tesla that is simply presentation and not substance, and Elon is a master at messaging,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “The problem is the reality is starting to stack up, and that’s a reality of accidents the cars have had, quality issues, and massive misses on Model 3 production numbers. You add all that up and there’s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.”

There’s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.
And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions — though Tesla’s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.
Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity’s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.
In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company’s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.
But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company’s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that “people should have zero concerns” about Tesla’s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.
But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.
The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.
Moody’s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody’s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.
“Liquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,” Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody’s, said in an interview. “They need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.”

The Windows era at Microsoft, long in eclipse, is officially history.
Microsoft said on Tuesday that it was splitting up its Windows engineering team and that the leader of its Windows business was leaving.
The moves, analysts said, were part of a reorganization intended to accelerate Microsoft’s emphasis on newer, faster-growing businesses like cloud computing and data-fueled artificial intelligence. That shift, they noted, has been underway since Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014.
In an email to employees, Mr. Nadella cited the central role of cloud computing and the advances in artificial intelligence — and their potential across all the company’s products. The organizational overhaul, Mr. Nadella wrote, “enables us to step up to this opportunity.”
Terry Myerson, 45, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Windows and devices group, will be departing. In a separate email to employees, Mr. Myerson said that he supported the company’s evolution under Mr. Nadella.

“I believe in it, and these changes are great for Microsoft,” wrote Mr. Myerson, who worked for the company for 21 years.

But with the revamp, the Windows group will be smaller and its engineering efforts dispersed. Windows technology, analysts said, will increasingly be folded into Microsoft’s cloud software. Other engineers will create the user applications — “Windows experiences,” in Microsoft terms — that ride on top of the underlying software, in smartphones, tablets, personal computers and game consoles.
Today, cloud services from Amazon, Microsoft and Google have become the internet equivalent of Windows, the dominant operating system of the personal computer era.
Software developers write new applications to run on the cloud services, just as they once did for the Windows operating system. Microsoft has successfully rewritten its popular Office productivity products as web-based applications running on the cloud.
The reorganization is “really doubling down on the cloud as the fundamental platform for Microsoft,” said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner.

Microsoft’s cloud business is powering its growth. In the most recent quarter, its Azure business grew 98 percent and its cloud-based Office 365 offering by 41 percent. By contrast, the division that includes the Windows PC software increased 2 percent.
The formal relegation of the Windows franchise, said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, “has been a long time coming.” And such a transition, Mr. Cusumano said, “probably had to be done by a second or third generation of leader.” Mr. Nadella succeeded Steven A. Ballmer, the longtime ally and friend of Microsoft’s co-founder, Bill Gates.
Beyond the organizational changes, Mr. Nadella said in his email that Microsoft’s research leader, Harry Shum, and president, Brad Smith, have established a panel, the A.I. and Ethics in Engineering and Research Committee, to increase the odds that A.I. technology “benefits the broader society.”
That move, said Patrick Moorhead, an independent analyst, is Microsoft’s effort to show it is “serious about the broader implications of A.I.” at a time of rising concern about the technology’s influence on people’s behavior and as a threat to jobs.

WASHINGTON — President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes — and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation’s largest e-commerce business.
Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country’s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its “Delivery Boy.”
The president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos.
By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon’s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target.
Advertisement
The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases.
Advertisement
Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that “the president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.”
Still, Mr. Trump’s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.
His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.
The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network’s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.
“The general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,” Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president’s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.
Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.
Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.
Brad Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump’s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: “Do not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm…”
Advertisement
And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites — some of which Mr. Trump is known to read — have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: “BEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.”
The Post declined to comment.
One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.
People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.
In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.
The president’s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump’s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon’s growing power in the marketplace.
“The Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company’s C.E.O.,” Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.
There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. “This is the guy who said that not paying taxes ‘makes me smart,’” said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.
How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.

If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.
“It would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.
But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.
AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department’s decision to block the companies’ $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.
Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom’s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.
Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company’s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.
The size of company’s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.
In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.
But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump’s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.
Michael D. Shear and Cecilia Kang reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from Seattle. Katie Rogers and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.

Even as it issues full-page apologies in print newspapers promising ritualistically “to do better,” Facebook and its allies have minimized the importance of the seismic revelation that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on behalf of the Trump campaign in 2016, had gained access to the private information of about 50 million Facebook users.
Some executives have pointed out that the mechanism that until a few years ago allowed a researcher with 270,000 app downloads to have access to 50 million profiles wasn’t exactly a secret, and, besides, Facebook users nominally agreed to the sharing of these profiles so that apps would perform better. The company’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter to complain that Facebook and other “platforms” were being held to a double standard concerning the profiles, since they may well “have been criticized as monopolists for locking them down.”
Others poured cold water on the idea that Cambridge Analytica was able to use these profiles as grist for its research on swaying voters by cracking the code of human intention. Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member, doesn’t tweet anymore, but he “likes” hundreds of tweets a week, a group that recently included a string that mocked the public’s fear that new media forms can be turned into “weapons of total mind control.”
Perhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be outraged. What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children — namely, the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity.
When you look at the Facebook data leak scandal this way, you realize that Facebook’s irresponsibility isn’t merely an abuse of a personal relationship — what its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, called “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us” — but also an abuse of a civic relationship.
Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce, especially in light of our country’s record of denying voting rights to African-Americans. Facebook can’t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line.
What was valuable about allowing a presidential campaign to evade regulation? Well, to start, we know that Facebook, unlike a small-market TV station, didn’t care about Russians buying political ads, even when they paid in rubles. That’s a shock to our political system, which is meant to protect against foreign interference. But more menacing is the prospect that the Trump campaign and its allies may have been given free license by Facebook to suppress African-American turnout through “dark ad posts” that disappeared after viewing.
Shortly before the election, a senior official with the Trump campaign bragged to the Bloomberg reporters Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg, “We have three major voter suppression operations underway,” which the article described as targeting “idealistic white liberals, young women, and African-Americans.” Brad Parscale, who ran the Trump campaign’s digital advertising, is quoted in the same piece discussing his plan to use dark ad posts of an animation of Hillary Clinton referring in 1996 to some African-Americans as “super predators.” Parscale suggested that the campaign would use this image to discourage a demographic category described by the reporters as infrequent black voters in Florida. “Only the people we want to see it, see it,” he explained. “It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.”
Some of the dark Facebook ads, bought by suspected Russian fronts, have been released as part of congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and these include an ad meant to depress black support for Hillary Clinton by referring to conspiracy theories involving her husband. What other dark Facebook ads might have been placed on behalf of the Trump campaign to suppress black turnout? Were there classic examples of voter suppression, like publishing the wrong Election Day date or falsely warning that you can be arrested at your polling place if you owe payment on a traffic ticket? We don’t know — the dark ads have disappeared and Facebook won’t release them, citing the privacy of its advertisers.
Facebook’s vast and well-designed platform offered the Trump campaign and its supporters cheap, direct access to African-American voters — and along with this the chance to mislead and intimidate. In the past, candidates intent on suppressing the black vote ran up against technological barriers. They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads, since reputable media outlets, unlike Facebook, tended to push back against racially inflammatory, untrue political advertising. Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue, too.
The election of 2016, the first after Barack Obama’s presidency, was notable for a seven-percentage-point decrease in African-American turnout, from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. This was the first decline in 20 years in a presidential election and the largest ever recorded. The 2016 turnout rate was also below even the rate for the 2004 election, when John Kerry was the Democratic candidate.
At a hearing with the top lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota began by emphasizing the stakes involved. “I come at this with the simple idea that our democracy was formed to be self-governing,” she said, adding that American citizens have “a right of freedom to make their own decisions — and I think that was interfered with by Russians and also others.”
This simple idea of the United States as a self-governing community wasn’t the focus of the many mea culpa interviews Mr. Zuckerberg gave after reports of the data breach. He was focused on the individual. “A lot of the most sensitive issues that we faced today are conflicts between our real values, right?” he said in an interview with Recode. “Freedom of speech and hate speech and offensive content. Where is the line, right?”
Todd A. Cox, the director of policy of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, sees the question of our “real values” a bit differently. “There has been a lot of agonizing and struggling over the place of First Amendment,” he told me. “I would like the discussion to turn on what role does the 14th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act, 15th Amendment play” — the guarantees of equal protection under the law and of the right of African-Americans to vote. That is, in addition to Facebook’s libertarian, Silicon Valley perspective that sees only the personal questions — my right to say what I want, my privacy — we must consider the collective questions: How do we protect historically discriminated groups? How do first we make sure everyone is able to speak through free, fair elections before we argue about what they can say?
This week, Facebook delayed the release of its home assistant devices and unveiled yet another attempt to make its privacy settings clear and easy to use. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,” Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, and deputy general counsel, Ashlie Beringer, said in a statement announcing the new privacy system.
Facebook is insistent on seeing its failures as harming individuals, never society as a whole. The legal scholar Alexander Bickel was fond of saying, “No answer is what the wrong question begets.” Facebook has been asking the wrong question consistently for more than a decade, which is why its privacy scandals can seem like the longest running show in Silicon Valley. Recent events have offered us a chance to reframe the question about how to fix Facebook. It is one that all Americans should have a voice in answering.

	On March 23, a 38-year-old man driving a Tesla Model X rammed headfirst into an unshielded highway median while traveling south on U.S. Highway 101 near Mountain View, California. Two other vehicles subsequently rear-ended the SUV, which caught fire after the driver, who later died from his injuries, was pulled from the wreckage.

According to news reports, the car blaze shut the highway for 5 hours, firefighters required special suits for cleanup, and at one point had to call Tesla for help in containing the blaze. On Tuesday (March 27), the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced a field investigation into the incident.

		Here is the scene on Highway 101S in #MountainView where a #Tesla caught on fire pic.twitter.com/ksnidlFgsw

	""Here we have an electric vehicle involved in a postcrash fire. … Did the batteries play a role in that? Did the batteries make it harder for the fire to be put out?"" NTSB spokesman Chris O'Neil told The Washington Post.

	These are all excellent questions that Tesla drivers might be itching to have answered.

	But are Teslas more likely to catch fire than other cars? And when they do catch fire, why are they such a nightmare to put out?

	The limited available data suggest that electric vehicles are not more prone to battery fires — but their lithium-ion batteries can fuel hotter fires that release toxic fumes and are harder to extinguish, experts say.[The Surprising Physics of 7 Everyday Things]

	The batteries that fuel a typical gasoline-powered car differ from those in an electric vehicle. The former are lead-acid-based, with lower energy densities — meaning they carry less energy in the same amount of space — than the compact,rechargeable lithium-ion, or Li-ion, batteries that power electric vehicles, including the Tesla Model X.

	A normal 12-volt ""small"" gasoline-powered car battery provides roughly 0.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy. Since the fully electric battery in the Model X comes with 75- to 100-kWh batteries, this means roughly 150 to 200 normal car batteries would be needed to power the SUV.

	Another difference between the battery you might jump in a gas-powered car and the one you'd find under a Model X hood is that, while lead-acid batteries can self-ignite with small fires, those can't leap into other parts of the battery to ignite them and cause a chain reaction. This can happen in lithium-ion batteries, however, said Peter Sunderland, a professor of fire protection engineering at the University of Maryland. Sometimes, when a Li-ion battery gets damaged, it shorts. The resulting spark might ignite the nearby lithium, and the lithium next to that, until the whole battery is ablaze.

	The trick with designing an EV battery, in particular, is balancing the benefits of higher energy density — which enables the EVs to go farther on each charge — with the associated risks of battery sparking. ""Higher energy density means a higher risk of external sparking,""Arunachalanadar Mada Kannan, a professor of engineering at Arizona State University, told Live Science.

	More often in EVs, however, lithium-ion battery fires happen due to thermal runaway, or the spontaneous explosion of the battery thanks to a buildup of heat in the cells inside. In its recent blog post, Tesla noted that the battery packs in the company's electrical vehicles were designed with firewalls, so that a fire would spread slowly enough to give the driver time to exit the car.

	Li-ion battery fires can be very intense, emitting large amounts of heat and smoke or gas, Bengt-Erik Mellander, a professor of subatomic and plasma physics at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, told Live Science in an email.

	The recent high-profile Tesla fires have started after the battery was damagedin some way.

	""The crash in Mountain View was very violent, chopping off the front end of the car and severely damaging the front end of the battery storage under the car (as far as I can see),"" Mellander wrote. In the 2013 fire, the Model S's battery compartment was also damaged prior to the fire, when an errant metal object hit the undercarriage.

	The recent Model X crash has brought back the debate on whether electric vehicles (EVs) are saferthan gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles when it comes to car fires. (Separately, investigators are asking whether the Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot mode contributed to the crash.)

	This isn't the first time a Tesla has caught fire. In 2013, a Tesla Model S driving near Seattle experienced an unexpected fire in its car battery. Videos and images of the fiery inferno splashed across media outlets, and Tesla's stock took a tumble before company CEO Elon Musk swooped in to assuage consumer concerns. In his blog, Musk did some quick calculations to determine that ""You are 5 times more likely to experience a fire in a conventional gasoline car than a Tesla!""

	In fact, the limited statistics available suggest electric vehicles are not more prone to fires, Mellander noted.

	In order to further minimize risks, however, ""something needs to be done at the level of the manufacturing plant, where these batteries are being made,"" Sunderland said. ""Better quality control, better research and development to make sure the battery materials are up to standards.""

	Though electric cars may not be more fire-prone, ""the risks and the strategies to use in case of an accident and a subsequent fire are different to that of fires in conventional cars,"" Mellander said.

	Sunderland agreed. While firefighters know how to handle gasoline fires, these personnel are not as well-trained in dealing with electrical emission hazards. ""With a gasoline fire, they know if they get enough water on it, it'll go out,"" he said. ""But with a deep-seated fire, it's hard to spray the water deep enough into the battery to stop the fire.""

Slate reported that the firefighters who attempted to put out the 2013 Model S car fire in Seattle had trouble and ""ended up using a circular saw to cut a hole that would allow them to pour water directly on the battery.""

	In a fiery Tesla crash into a barrier in Austria, the car kept reigniting, forcing firefighters to battle the flames for hours. The car had to be put into quarantine for 48 hours to remove the chances of reignition, Jalopnik reported.

	What's more, lithium-ion fires can release high levels of ""toxic gases"" such as carbon monoxide, soot, hydrogen fluoride, and particulates of oxides of nickel; aluminum; lithium; copper; and cobalt, according to a Tesla Model X emergency response guide. As a result, firefighters need to wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and should use hoses that spray fog and special ventilation fans that push air out at a high velocity to protect bystanders downwind of the fire, according to the guide.

	Firefighters need more training, but the reality is that fires in electric vehicles don't happen that often, Sunderland said.

	However, if many more electric vehicles take to the roads in the future, these fires could become more common, and firefighters will need to know how to safely extinguish them.

	Ultimately, accidents like this one shouldn't discourage consumers from investing in clean-energy vehicles, Sunderland said. ""Fatalities are setbacks, but help us accept there is never zero risk with EVs,"" he said.

	March 21 marks the 250th birthday of one of the most influential mathematicians in history. He accompanied Napoleon on his expedition to Egypt, revolutionized science's understanding of heat transfer, developed the mathematical tools used today to create CT and MRI scan images, and discovered the greenhouse effect.

	His name was Joseph Fourier. He wrote of mathematics: “There cannot be a language more universal and more simple, more free from errors and obscurities … Mathematical analysis is as extensive as nature itself, and it defines all perceptible relations.” Fourier's work continues to shape life today, especially for people like ourselves working in fields such as mathematics and radiology.

	As a troubled orphan in France, Fourier was transformed by his first encounter with mathematics. Thanks to a local bishop who recognized his talent, Fourier received an education through Benedictine monks. As a college student, he so loved math that he collected discarded candle stumps so he could continue his studies after others had gone to bed.

	As a young man, Fourier was soon swept up by the French Revolution. However, he became disenchanted by its excessive brutality, and his protests landed him in prison for part of 1794. After his release, he was appointed to the faculty of an engineering school. There he proved his genius by substituting for ill colleagues, teaching subjects ranging from physics to classics.

	Traveling with Napoleon to Egypt in 1978, Fourier was appointed secretary of the Egyptian Institute, which Napoleon modeled on the Institute of France. When the British fleet stranded the French forces, he organized the manufacture of weapons and munitions to permit the French to continue fighting. Fourier returned to France after the British navy forced the French to surrender. Even in the midst of such difficult circumstances, he managed to publish a number of mathematical papers.

	One of the most important fruits of Fourier's studies concerns heat.

Fourier's law states that heat transfers through a material at a rate proportional to both the difference in temperature between different areas and to the area across which the transfer takes place. For example, people who are overheated can cool off quickly by getting to a cool place and exposing as much of their body to it as possible.

	Fourier's work enables scientists to predict the future distribution of heat. Heat is transferred through different materials at different rates. For example, brass has a high thermal conductivity. Air is poorly conductive, which is why it's frequently used in insulation.

	Remarkably, Fourier's equation applies widely to matter, whether in the form of solid, liquid or gas. It powerfully shaped scientists' understanding of both electricity and the process of diffusion. It also transformed scientists' understanding of flow in nature generally – from water's passage through porous rocks to the movement of blood through capillaries.

	Today, when helping to care for patients, radiologists rely on another mathematical discovery of Fourier's, now referred to as the “Fourier transform.”

	In CT scans, doctors send X-ray beams through a patient from multiple different directions. Some X-rays emerge from the other side, where they can be measured, while others are blocked by structures within the body.

	With many such measurements taken at many different angles, it becomes possible to determine the degree to which each tiny block of tissue blocked the beam. For example, bone blocks most of the X-rays, while the lungs block very little. Through a complex series of computations, it's possible to reconstruct the measurements into two-dimensional images of a patient's internal anatomy.

	Thanks to Fourier and today's powerful computers, doctors can create almost instantaneous images of the brain, the pulmonary arteries, the appendix and other parts of the body. This in turn makes it possible to confirm or rule out the presence of issues such as blood clots in the pulmonary arteries or inflammation of the appendix. It's difficult to imagine practicing medicine today without such CT images.

	Fourier is generally regarded as the first scientist to notice what we today call the greenhouse effect.

	His interest was piqued when he observed that a planet as far away from the sun as Earth should be considerably cooler. He hypothesized that something about the Earth – in particular, its atmosphere – must enable it to trap solar radiation that would otherwise simply radiate back out into space.

	Fourier created a model of the Earth involving a box with a glass cover. Over time, the temperature in the box rose above that of the surrounding air, suggesting that the glass continually trapped heat. Because his model resembled a greenhouse in some respects, this phenomenon came to be called the “greenhouse effect.”

	Later, scientist John Tyndall discovered that carbon dioxide can play the role of heat trapper.

	Life on earth as we know it would not be possible without the greenhouse effect. However, today scientists tend to be more concerned about an excess of greenhouse gases. Mathematical models suggest that as carbon dioxide accumulates, heat may be trapped more quickly, resulting in elevated global average temperatures, melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels.

	Fourier received many honors during his lifetime, including election to the French Academy of Science.

	Some believed, perhaps speciously, that Fourier's attraction to heat may have hastened his death. He was known to climb into saunas in multiple layers of clothes, and his acquaintances claimed that he kept his rooms hotter than Hades. At any rate, in May 1830, he died of an aneurysm at the age of 63.

	Today, Fourier's name is inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. But more importantly, it is immortalized in Fourier's law and the Fourier transform, enduring emblems of his belief that mathematics holds the key to the universe.

	A mesmerizing new video shows scientists crafting dazzling, slinky-like sculptures made completely out of liquid — and the liquid structures can hold their shape for months.

	Researchers created the ghostly-looking sculptures by manipulating the properties of water and oil. Anyone who has ever tried to make salad dressing knows oil and water normally don't mix; their molecules are simply more attracted to their own kind than to each other — unless, of course, you use a substance like mustard that can bring the sides together.

	When you do that, you can make oil and water stick together in solution, said Joe Forth, a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. ""But you can't make complex structures. In fact, you can only ever make a sphere."" [The Mysterious Physics of 7 Everyday Things]

	Forth and his team have created structures far more interesting than spheres that suggest a stunning new way to think of technology.

	""You can change their shape basically as much as you want as long as you do it gently enough,"" Forth told Live Science.

	When oil and water mix, the oil either glops at the bottom or forms a slick on top. An emulsifier — like mustard or soap — stabilizes the two and allows oil (such as that in dirt on your hands) to mix with water (like that coming from the faucet on your sink). 

	 

	So the scientists created their own ""supersoap."" They added tiny gold nanoparticles to the water, and to the oil, they added a ligand — a chemical that specializes in bonding to negatively charged material, like metal. The oil and water stayed separate, but the ligands and gold-laced water formed a glass-like barrier between the two liquids that allowed the water to take whatever shape the researchers wanted — and hold those forms for months at a time.

	""They are self-healing,"" Tom Russell, a visiting scientist at the lab and the lead investigator, told Live Science. ""If you puncture it with, say, a needle that makes a hole, that hole will be healed.""

	Once the team mastered the basic science, they used a modified 3D printer to create spirals, tree-like branches, lattices and even threads thinner than a human hair.

	Aside from being hypnotic to watch, these creations could facilitate interesting new technologies. Because the water is conductive, it could become a type of flexible liquid electrical cable. Or perhaps a chemical syringe that injects specific molecules into an ongoing liquid chemical reaction. Or even a liquid battery.

	What's more, water conducts both ions and electrons, while oil can store energy — two necessary properties of electrical circuits, Russell said. ""We could make all-liquid circuits. That's not far-reaching at all.""

	While crossing the street on Sunday night (March 18), a 49-year-old woman in Tempe, Arizona was struck and killed by a self-driving car operated by Uber.

	Though the autonomous car had a human safety driver behind the wheel who could have theoretically taken control, neither car nor driver detected the pedestrian — who was walking her bike across an intersection — before the vehicle struck her at roughly 40 miles per hour. The woman, Elaine Herzberg, died of her injuries in what is thought to be the first pedestrian fatality caused by a self-driving vehicle on a public road, the New York Times reported.

	Local authorities and Uber are investigating the accident, which has already begun drawing public attention to the risks and benefits of self-driving cars. The accident may result in safer autonomous cars regulated by more stringent oversight. Still, many researchers believe that more self-driving cars will ultimately be safer than their human counterparts — and they may be right. [Self-Driving Cars: 5 Problems That Need to Be Addressed]

	""More than 90 percent of car crashes in the U.S. are thought to involve some form of driver error,"" Peter Hancock, a professor of psychology and civil engineering at the University of Central Florida, wrote in The Conversation. ""Eliminating this error would, in two years, save as many people as the country lost in all of the Vietnam War."" (In other words, about 58,000 people).

	Road traffic is the 5th leading cause of death in the world, and the United States is one of the deadliest high-income nations when it comes to highway safety. According to a report recently released by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 37,461 people died in traffic accidents in 2016. About 5,987 of those deaths were pedestrian fatalities — roughly 16 every day. Compared to 2015, pedestrian fatalities increased by 9 percent, resulting in the highest pedestrian death toll since 1990.

	This upward trend in pedestrian deaths is, sadly, not new; pedestrian fatalities have climbed steadily in 6 out of the 7 years between 2009 and 2016, resulting in nearly 2,000 more deaths per year in 2016 than in 2009, according to the Governor's Highway Safety Association (GHSA), a nonprofit implemented to address behavioral safety issues among drivers. Many factors likely contribute to this unsettling trend, the GHSA wrote, including economic conditions, fuel prices, an increase in the total number of vehicle miles traveled nationwide and the challenge of rapidly increasing smartphone use distracting both drivers and pedestrians.

	Even in crashes that involve self-driving vehicles, unpredictable or distracted human behavior may often be at fault. A 2015 study by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute found that, per millions of miles traveled, autonomous cars had a higher crash rate than human-piloted cars — however, no self-driving cars had been found at fault for the crashes they were involved in. Teaching self-driving cars to respond to unpredictable human behavior may be the technology's greatest challenge going forward.

	So far, only one other human fatality has occurred in a crash involving an autonomous car. In 2016, a motorist driving a tractor trailer swerved in front of a Tesla Model S driving in self-drive mode. The Tesla failed to engage its brakes in time, crashing into the trailer ahead of it and killing the Tesla's human safety driver.

	A robot built at MIT has reportedly set a world speed record for solving a Rubik's Cube, cutting the previous record of 0.637 seconds (set by another robot in 2016) down to just 0.38 seconds. If robots had grandparents, this one's would be very proud.

	The Rubik's-solving robot was constructed at MIT this January by Ben Katz, a mechanical engineering graduate student, and Jared Di Carlo, an electrical engineering and computer science student, at a student-run hacker lab. According to a news release from MIT, the two became inspired when they noticed a design flaw in footage of the previous robot record-holder, a compact sphere of whirling motors created by German engineer Albert Beer. [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures]

	""We watched the videos of the previous robots, and we noticed that the motors were not the fastest that could be used,"" Di Carlo said in a statement. ""We thought we could do better with improved motors and controls.""

	In their new speed-solving bot, Katz and Di Carlo engineered individual motors to control six metal rods gripping the cube's six faces. Two webcams send footage of the cube to a nearby computer, helping the robot identify which colors fall on which face of the cube at a given time. Working from this information, the robot solves the cube with an algorithm previously used in other Rubik's-solving robots.

	In the video above, you can see the whole process in action — just don't blink.

	While our fleshy human fingers cannot hope to best the whirling motors and metal grips of robots like these, professional human speedcubers have set some pretty mind-boggling speed records of their own. The current world speed record for solving a Rubik's Cube is held by SeungBeom Cho, who solved a jumbled cube in 4.59 seconds at a 2007 World Cube Organization competition. According to the Rubik's Cube community Ruwix.com, Cho beat the previous world record by just one-tenth of a second.



	Members of the machine uprising resistance movement, take heart: Although robots may be much faster than humans at solving Rubik's cubes, flipping hamburgers and climbing up sheer vertical walls, they still look ridiculous trying to open doors.

	NEW YORK — Looking down at the vast curve of planet Earth hundreds of miles below, I can see its white cloud cover stretching over expanses of blue ocean.

	This may be the closest I'll ever get to outer space, but I haven't left Midtown Manhattan. I'm peering at our distant world using a special ""space"" helmet that re-creates the dizzying sensation of hovering far above the planet.

	Displayed across my visor — and on those of my fellow ""astronauts"" in the seats of a small theater — were excerpts from ""One Strange Rock,"" a new documentary series from the National Geographic Channel that showcases the beauty of our planet as seen through the eyes of astronauts, the only people who have viewed it firsthand from hundreds of miles above Earth's surface.

	At the theater event Wednesday (March 14), National Geographic offered a preview of the new series with a special presentation of video footage that mimicked the experience of seeing Earth from a vast distance. Though the series will air on television without this immersive experience, the ""space"" helmets will also be used in presentations and programs at schools and planetariums in several U.S. cities in the near future, according to a statement from Nat Geo. [What a View: Amazing Astronaut Images of Earth]

	Nat Geo created these helmet theaters to help users see Earth as astronauts do.

	The helmet is somewhat like a virtual-reality (VR) headset, in that it replaces the user's perspective of the world around them. But its internally projected field of view is much wider than is typical for VR headsets, and users can freely move their heads within the helmet to look around at the screen, much as an astronaut might rotate their head to take in the view while on a spacewalk, according to the statement.

	Each helmet contains a built-in media player and laser projector — along with a tiny exhaust fan — mounted at the top, and all helmets at the screening were synced wirelessly and activated simultaneously by remote. Footage that played on the inside of the visor was mapped to fit the curvature of the projection surface and projected with fisheye optics so that it did not look distorted.

	 

	In preparation for our ""launch,"" we first buckled on a harness topped by a rigid base that covered our shoulders and necks; the helmets were attached after we took our seats, and once we lowered the visors, the show began, appearing on a curved screen just a few inches away from our noses.

	After the screening, the helmets came off, and it was time for the real astronaut stars of the series to take the stage, to describe what it's like to view our home planet from space.

	For former NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, who conducted experiments while on the Earth-orbiting Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992, the experience reinforced her existing sense of her relationship to the planet and the other forms of life that we share it with — even the ones that are too small to see.

	""I cannot process food by myself — I need the little microbes in my gut that are part of me to process my food,"" Jemison told Live Science. ""For my food to be grown, I need the microbes and all the minerals that were in the soil. That's what this is about — this balance, and how we're connected to this world."" [Earth Pictures: Iconic Images of Earth from Space]

	 

	And how did the views in ""One Strange Rock"" — in the helmets or on conventional screens — measure up against the real thing?

	""I think it portrays that really well!"" former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino, who performed two spacewalks to repair the Hubble Space Telescope in 2002 and 2009, told Live Science. ""Especially the emotional aspects of it, and how we can use that experience of flying in space to tell the story of our home planet.""

	Astronauts are often asked to describe the feeling of being in space and looking down at Earth from far away — an experience that is shared by only a handful of people. ""One Strange Rock"" conveys not only how space looks to astronauts but how it feels to be out there, looking back at their distant home, retired Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut Chris Hadfield, who served on three space missions, including a stint as commander of the International Space Station from 2012 to 2013, told Live Science.

	Seeing Earth from a distance was ""a deeply personal experience,"" Hadfield said.

	Even without the helmets, ""One Strange Rock"" presents a unique — and emotional — view of Earth, from tiny air bubbles generated by algae, to the sweeping vista of our ""blue marble"" planet nestled against the inky, star-speckled backdrop of space.

	""One Strange Rock"" is executive-produced by Jane Root and her production company Nutopia, and premieres March 26 at 10 p.m. Eastern/9 p.m. Central time on the National Geographic Channel.

	Stephen Hawking, one of the brightest minds of modern physics, has died at the age of 76 at his home in Cambridge, England, The Guardian reported today (March 14). He was perhaps the best-known physicist in the world, despite having to communicate via a computerized voice that recorded the minute motion of his cheek muscle.

	""We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today,"" Lucy, Robert and Tim Hawking, the children of the physicist, said in a statement announcing his death. ""He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years.""

	Hawking was a brilliant student of physics at the University of Cambridge when he was diagnosed with the degenerative nerve disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, at the age of 21. ALS affects the neurons that help us move our muscles, so Hawking used a wheelchair for decades and communicated via a computerized ""voice."" He nevertheless continued working and soon developed a series of groundbreaking theories that would remake the world of physics. In 1966, the cosmologist published his doctoral thesis, which argued that the entire universe began as a singularity.  

	He then went on to reshape our understanding of black holes. Until Hawking's work, scientists believed absolutely nothing could escape a black hole, meaning that a black hole would grow ever larger. But Hawking posited that quantum mechanics essentially allowed black holes to emit particles — a phenomenon now known as Hawking radiation.

	Hawking was also a deeply witty popularizer of some of the most esoteric concepts in physics and cosmology, with books such as ""A Brief History of Time"" (Bantam Books, 1988). In recent years, he weighed in on everything from the future of humanity, to the risks of artificial intelligence, to the chances of Earth turning into Venus, all while continuing to publish important theoretical work in physics.

	The burger-flipping robotic fry cook has been temporarily ""retired."" Why? Because the robot's human colleagues couldn't keep up with it.

	Built by Miso Robotics, Flippy, described on the company's website as ""the world's first autonomous robotic kitchen assistant,"" was touted as a high-tech helper for fast-food restaurant kitchens in a statement announcing its unveiling in 2017. Equipped with a spatula-tipped arm, Flippy was built to operate alongside human workers and to increase efficiency in cooking and grill maintenance.

	But poor Flippy faced unexpected challenges in meeting the demands of hungry restaurant patrons, and was relieved of his responsibilities after only two days on the job. [The 6 Strangest Robots Ever Created]

	But it wasn't Flippy's fault. Rather, the robot's human co-workers weren't able to assemble the burgers as quickly as Flippy could grill the patties, USA Today reported.

	Flippy joined the staff working the grill at a CaliBurger restaurant in Pasadena, California, on March 5, where he was tasked with flipping burgers and scooping them off the grill once they were fully cooked, Miso Robotics representatives announced in a statement released that day.

	The robotic fry cook combined a jointed arm — capable of wielding a spatula or a grill scraper — with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) and thermal vision that enabled it to tell whether a burger was raw or well-done. To ensure that all burgers were thoroughly cooked, Flippy would monitor each patty in real time, using a display screen readout to inform its human co-workers when a burger is ready for dressings and a bun.

	In a video shared by Miso Robotics, Flippy's view of a grill included a thermal readout displayed in the upper-right corner, indicating which patties were ready to be flipped or served.



FLIPPY | POV from Miso Robotics on Vimeo.

	Flippy wasn't intended to replace people but rather to serve as ""extra hands"" at the grill, Miso Robotics representatives said in the statement. 

	CaliBurger prepared for Flippy's debut with a special cooking area designated as the robot's kitchen domain, including a sign that read ""Flippy's Corner."" But Flippy's introduction did not go as smoothly as planned, as there were not enough people working behind the counter to dress the finished burgers at the pace Flippy could make them, a CaliBurger representative told USA Today.

	Miso Robotics announced in 2017 that autonomous burger-makers like Flippy would be installed in more than 50 CaliBurger locations around the world by the end of 2019. But for now, the one location willing to take a chance on a robot fry cook has temporarily turned off its spotlight. The Pasadena CaliBurger's website still urges customers to ""Come see Flippy in action,"" though Flippy's schedule has been amended to read ""to be announced.""

	There's a limit to how fast information can move through the universe, just like there's a limit to how fast everything else can move through the universe. It's a rule. But a team of quantum physicists, like quantum physicists often do, has figured out how to bend it.

	Under normal circumstances, the ultimate limit on information transfer — the bandwidth of the universe — is one bit per fundamental particle, moving no faster than the speed of light. That's in the ""classical universe,"" the way things behave before quantum physics gets involved.

	Here's where that limit comes from: If you want to get a message made up of the bits ""1"" or ""0"" to your friend a light-year away and all you have is a single photon, you can encode that single binary number into the photon and send it whizzing off toward your friend at light speed. That friend will receive the message a year later. If your friend wants to use that photon to get a binary message back to you, you'll have to wait another year. If you want to send more information in that time, you're going to need more photons. [Album: The World's Most Beautiful Equations]

	But in a new paper published Feb.8 in the journal Physical Review Letters, a pair of a quantum physicists showed that it's theoretically possible to double that bandwidth.

	The technique described in the paper, titled ""Two-Way Communication with a Single Quantum Particle,"" doesn't allow you to send your friend two bits with one particle. But it does allow you and your friend to each send one another one bit of information using the same particle at the same time.

	If two people want to pull that trick off, the researchers wrote, they have to put the particle in a ""superposition of different spatial locations.""

	""That's usually described as being in two places at the same time,"" study co-author Flavio Del Santo, of the University of Vienna, told Live Science.

	The reality is a bit more complicated, but imagining the particle in two places at once is a useful shortcut to understanding what's going on here.

	That way, Alice and Bob (that's what Del Santo and his co-author Borivoje Dakić, of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Austria, called their quantum communicators) each have the same particle at the start of the communication. And each of the communicators, Del Santo said, can encode a single bit of information, a 1 or a zero, into the particle.

Their communicationis still limited by the speed of light. When Alice encodes a ""1"" into the particle, Bob doesn't immediately see it. She still has to send the particle back to him. But this situation is special, because Alice and Bob can each encode a bit of information into the particle and send it back toward each other at the same time.

	The message each of them sees when the particle arrives will be the result of their own bit of information and their interlocutor's added together. If Alice encoded a zero and Bob a 1, they'll each see a 1. But because Alice knows she put a zero in, she'll know Bob put in a 1. And because Bob knows he put a 1 in, he'll know Alice put in a zero. If both put in 1, or both put in zeros, the result will be zero.

	In each situation, both receivers will know what bit the other sent — and they'll have cut in half the time it usually takes for two people to send one another bits using a single particle.

	Bandwidth doubled.

	The paper, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, was purely theoretical, but Del Santo and Dakić partnered with a team of experimentalists at the University of Vienna to show that the method can work in the real world.

	This portion of their results hasn't yet been through peer review and publication in a journal, but it's available on the preprint server arXiv.

	The researchers used beam splitters to separate photons into spatial superposition, meaning they were, in a sense, in two places at once. By doing so, the scientists wrote, they pulled off just what the first paper described: encoding bits into split photons, mixing them back together and interpreting the results.

	The researchers also showed that, with a slight modification, this technique could be used to conduct perfectly secure communication. If one of the communicators, Alice, inputs a random string of bits and Bob encodes the true, coherent message, no eavesdropper would ever be able to figure out what Bob was telling Alice without knowing what Alice had encoded, Del Santo said.

	Europe's digital clocks are running behind schedule, and it's the former Yugoslavia's fault. 

	A squabble over a shared power grid between Serbia and its erstwhile territory Kosovo is to blame for ""continuous significant power deviations"" across most of Europe, causing certain types of electric clocks to run up to 6 minutes slow, according to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), the Brussels-based organization responsible for the continental grid.

	Digital clocks such as those found in alarms, heaters, ovens and microwaves rely on the frequency of a power grid, rather than a quartz crystal, to keep time. Europe, like most of Africa and Asia, taps an alternating current of 50 hertz; as such, every 50 oscillations of alternating current in these places equals 1 second of grid time. For the United States, which maintains a standard frequency of 60 hertz, 60 oscillations is the equivalent of a second. [5 of the Most Precise Clocks Ever Made]

	Even an infinitesimally minor deviation in this flow can add up. When power fluctuations led the European network's frequency to fall to 49.996 hertz in the middle of January, for instance, it resulted in 113 gigawatt hours of lost energy.

	The disruption has affected much of the continent — as clocks in 25 countries have lost time — with the exception of the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries and parts of the former Soviet Union, which are not as beholden to the continental grid.

	The problem began when a power plant in Kosovo, which seceded from Serbia in 2008, went down for repairs, diminishing the electrical supply. Serbia, despite a 2015 agreement to preserve the integrity of the European grid, refused to make up the difference.

	Still, there are signs that this wrinkle in timekeeping will smooth over. ""Deviation stopped yesterday after Kosovo took some steps, but it will take some time to get the system back to normal,"" ENTSO-E spokeswoman Susanne Nies told Reuters Tuesday (March 6).

	The political row is far from over, however, given that Serbia doesn't support Kosovo's independence.

	""We will try to fix the technicalities … but the question of who will compensate for this loss has to be answered,"" Nies said.

	Scientists want to power cities with the same high-energy explosions that power the hearts of stars. This process is called nuclear fusion, and it results (in stars, at least) in massive amounts of sustainable, zero-carbon energy.

	According to scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a new $30 million research initiative may make this long-sought-after energy source a widespread reality on Earth within the next 15 years.

	MIT researchers have teamed up with a new private company called Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) to carry out a rapid research project that they say could dramatically accelerate fusion energy technology. The ultimate goal of the project is to build a compact, fully functional fusion reactor called a tokamak, which could fit on a truck and produce 100 million wattsof power, the researchers said in a statement.

	But the first step is to create ""the world's most powerful superconducting electromagnets,"" a key component in building the reactor. Supported by $30 million in funding from CFS, the MIT team hopes to finish this first stage of the project within the next three years. [Science Fact or Fiction? The Plausibility of 10 Sci-Fi Concepts]

	""Advances in superconducting magnets have put fusion energy potentially within reach, offering the prospect of a safe, carbon-free energy future,"" MIT President L. Rafael Reif said in the statement.

	Fusion occurs when two lightweight atoms fuse together to form one heavier atom. Because the mass of the new atom is less than the mass of the two constituent atoms, this fusion produces massive amounts of excess energy in the form of light and heat. This process occurs naturally (and constantly) inside stars as they fuse hydrogen to create helium.

	Scientists believe they can re-create this process on Earth usingcommon atoms such as hydrogen, which can be extracted from water. However, to produce a net energy gain from the reaction, they'd first need to generate enormously high temperatures (upward of 176 million degrees Fahrenheit, or 80 million degrees Celsius) to heat that hydrogen into a plasma state — an extremely high-energy state of matter in which atoms are stripped of their electrons. When freed of their electrons, plasmas become electrically conductive and can be controlled by magnetic fields.

	The caveat, of course, is that plasma that hot would instantly burn through any container it came in contact with. That's where the superconducting magnets come in. Using powerful magnetic fields, researchers can actually hold superheated plasma in place without it touching the walls of the reactor.

	Over the next three years, MIT plans to construct electromagnets four times as strong as any magnets previously used in fusion experiments, the researchers said. The magnets will be made of a new superconductive material called yttrium-barium-copper oxide, which can be applied relatively cheaply via steel tape. The researchers will install the magnets in a prototype fusion reactor called Sparc, which they believe could be capable of producing 100 million wattsof power — enough to power a small city with safe, sustainable, carbon-free energy.

	If Sparc works according to plan, it could become the template for creating a commercial fusion power plant that's twice as large, producing as much power as many current power plants do but without the greenhouse gas emissions. The world's first functioning fusion plant could become operational within 15 years, according to the MIT statement.

	Meanwhile, other large-scale experiments in fusion energy are underway around the world, including the construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. Launched in 2007, the ITER is a partnership of 35 countries with an estimated completion date of 2040.

	Google has partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense to help the agency develop smarter drone software. According to a report from Gizmodo, Google has agreed to provide the DOD with machine-learning software that will help the department's computers better detect objects in surveillance drone footage.

	The new partnership, which was leaked from an internal Google mailing list last week and confirmed yesterday (March 6) in a statement, is part of a DOD initiative called Project Maven (also known as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Function Team). According to a DOD news release issued last July, Project Maven aims to improve America's ability to ""[win] wars with computer algorithms and artificial intelligence"" by rapidly upgrading the military's ability to analyze drone footage. [5 Surprising Ways Drones Could Be Used in the Future]

	The project's first goal is to develop artificial intelligence capable of automatically detecting ""38 classes of objects"" regularly seen in military drone footage, the DOD said. This will ultimately help data analysts parse the ""millions of hours of video"" captured each year by drones surveilling combat zones in such countries as Iraq and Syria.

	""AI will not be selecting a target [in combat] … any time soon,"" Marine Corps Col. Drew Cukor, chief of the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Function Team, said at a defense tech summit last year. ""What AI will do is complement the human operator.”

	Google will reportedly help the department achieve this goal by providing software building blocks known as TensorFlow application programming interfaces (APIs), which are often used in building neural networks.

	""This specific project is a pilot with the Department of Defense, to provide open source TensorFlow APIs that can assist in object recognition on unclassified data,"" a Google representative said in a  statement.""The technology flags images for human review, and is for non-offensive uses only.""

	This explanation doesn't sit well with some Google employees, Gizmodo reported, and some staffers are ""outraged"" at the company’s agreement to lend its technology to controversial drone operations. Countries around the world are nevertheless pouring funding into developing artificial intelligence for military purposes, which Cukor described as ""an AI arms race.""

	""No area will be left unaffected by the impact of this technology,"" he said.

	It is unknown whether the DOD is working with any other major tech companies as part of Project Maven at this time, or if Google stands alone.

	Russia could soon be able to conduct nuclear strikes all over the world without any chance of being intercepted, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday (March 1).

	Speaking on Russian television as part of his annual address, Putin announced a new class of weapons delivery systems designed to sneak past NATO's American-built ballistic missile defenses. As Putin spoke, computer-generated graphics and video footage playing behind him showed the capabilities of a new hypersonic missile, an underwater drone and a cruise missile with ""unlimited range"" designed to avoid detection systems.

	Experts in nuclear weapons and their politics said the move was far from a shock, given a years-long deterioration of global arms reduction efforts and the recent Trump administration announcement that the United States plans to deploy its own new nuclear tech. [7 Technologies That Transformed Warfare]

	""It was not surprising,"" said Philip Coyle, a nuclear weapons expert who worked for the Carter, Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations in various capacities related to nuclear policy and is now a senior science fellow at The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

	""When George W. Bush decided he wanted to get out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,"" Coyle told Live Science, ""we told people in his administration that this is what Russia would do. And again in 2004, Putin himself warned the United States that if we kept going the way we were going, this is what he was going to do. And he did it.""

	The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States and what was then the Soviet Union prevented either country from developing comprehensive defenses capable of shooting down incoming ballistic missiles, in order to avoid touching off an arms race in weapons designed to circumvent missile defenses. First signed in 1972, it remained in effect until President Bush withdrew the United States from the treaty in 2001 and ramped up American missile defense efforts.

	Those efforts, Coyle said, pushed Russia toward developing the kind of technology Putin announced Thursday.

	Right now, the most effective method that countries like the United States and Russia have for nuking one another is ballistic missiles. Hidden underground and in stealthy submarines all over the word, ballistic missiles can cross huge distances at blistering speeds. And in the sheer numbers of the American and Russian arsenals, they're impossible to meaningfully defend against, experts have said.

	That said, missile defenses of the sort the United States has developed might be able to knock a single ballistic missile out of the air, or even a handful of them if the operators got very lucky. [Could the US Stop Nuclear Weapons?]

	The new delivery systems Russia announced, some of which Putin said had already been tested, are designed to avoid missile defenses altogether.

	The most significant of them was the nuclear-powered cruise missile. Unlike ballistic missiles, which leave the atmosphere on long arcs, cruise missiles skim low over the ground, meaning they can fly closer to other obscuring objects and are more likely evade detection by radar. They also can travel long distances and, guided by an onboard computer, reach targets with high precision. In theory, a cruise missile carrying a nuclear bomb could slip under American defenses and detection systems, and detonate before Americans could mobilize a response.

		Breaking: Putin interrupts state-of-nation speech with videos of new weaponry that will overcome US missile defense. pic.twitter.com/g05ydN0bVC

	By powering the thing with a nuclear engine, Putin said Russia would give its cruise missile functionally unlimited range; nuclear power plants put out far more energy for far longer than conventional engines, which is why the American military uses them in submarines and aircraft carriers. Putin showed a computer-generated video of the Russian cruise missile circling the world, slipping around radar systems and arriving in North America from the southern end of the Pacific Ocean.

	Putin also announced the nuclear torpedo — an underwater missile with a nuclear warhead — which he said had been tested and could travel vast distances underwater before striking an enemy along the coast.

	Finally, he advertised an update to existing ballistic missile technology: a missle that can deploy multiple warheads, all of which enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds — up to 20 times the speed of sound — and could perform evasive maneuvers in flight before striking their targets.

	The upshot, Coyle said, is that none of these weapons could ever be defended against with modern technology.

	""[The ABM] was really meant to short-circuit the arms race dynamic,"" said Laura Grego, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program.

	At the time of the treaty's signing, officials with fresh memories of the ballistic missile technology race that peaked in the 1950s and '60s during the Cold War worried that missile defense technologies might provoke a new wave of arms escalation, she said.

	""Deterrence requires you to be able to hold your adversary at risk,"" Grego told Live Science. ""Defenses interrupt that. By building a defense, rather than discourage your adversary, your adversary is likely to just build more so that they can get up and over your defense. And then you build more defense. So it's an arms race cycle.""

		Putin unveils Russia's new stockpile of nuclear weapons with animated video of missile strike on Florida: https://t.co/k3d8F2mXHB pic.twitter.com/uTaYphgLjq

	Missile defenses can also ""create a use-it-or-lose it dynamic,"" Grego said.

	When two states have nuclear missiles and missile defense systems aimed at each other, both are incentivized to strike first. Wait and go second, and your reduced missile arsenal — whatever remains after your enemy's first strike — is more likely to crash ineffectively against their defenses. Go first, and you have a hope of doing enough damage to wipe out your enemy and ride out the return strike.

	Keeping fired missiles at bay is a tall order. In fact, Bush never planned to build a missile defense that could ward off the full might of the Russian ballistic missile arsenal. Instead, he pitched missile defenses as a necessary measure to defend the United States against the more limited arms of ""rogue states"" like Iran, as Time reported in 2007. But, as ABC News reported, the defenses turned out to be both expensive and ineffective in practice, leading President Barack Obama to scale down the program in 2009.

	As recently as January, a U.S. ballistic missile interceptor test ended in failure. That was the second such failure in under a year, even though, as arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis has pointed out on his podcast, these sorts of tests tend to take place during ideal conditions, very different from the situation one might expect in an actual nuclear emergency.

	Even so, arms control experts largely agree that these tests have provoked Russia's efforts to improve its methods for delivering a warhead to an American city.

	""Putin's announcement is a predictable reaction to the ongoing missile defense efforts of the United States. Now, it appears that the Trump administration is going to ramp up these defenses, increasing Russia's concerns,"" Lisbeth Gronlund, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program, said in an emailed statement.

	""Both nations have now stated they will deploy new types of nuclear weapons,"" she added. ""Putin's announcement further ratchets up what is clearly a new arms race between the two countries.""

	American defenses were likely not the only factor prompting Russia's decision, Grego cautioned, pointing out that internal politics can be as big a driver of announcements like this one as foreign policy. As Anton Troianovski pointed out in a Washington Post article, ""Putin's speech, less than three weeks before the Russian presidential election, represented an escalated level of martial rhetoric even by his pugnacious standards.""

	As much as American missile defense systems tend to fail, the reason they work at all, Grego said, is that ballistic missiles follow fairly predictable trajectories. [The Most Dangerous Space Weapons Ever]

	""Ballistic missiles, true to the name, go on a ballistic trajectory,"" she said. ""So they use these powerful engines to get themselves moving really fast, but after the engines burn out, they're just coasting.""

	At that point, tracking, predicting and intercepting a ballistic missile's trajectory becomes a straightforward question of precision and physics. Really difficult, extreme precision and physics that even the best American weapons engineers can't achieve reliably. But straightforward nonetheless.

	Russia's newly announced weapons circumvent that problem entirely because all of them, one way or another, arrive without going in a straight line. The underwater torpedo, low-flying cruise missile and hypersonic weapon — wherever they might be along the track of development — are all able to avoid missile defenses by simply arriving along unexpected, untrackable routes.

	Plus, the cruise missile flies low over land and ocean waves, below the effective reach of radar. The torpedo swims underwater. Even if somehow they could be tracked and predicted, nothing in the U.S. arsenal could catch up with them and strike them.

	""We do not have capabilities against these kinds of systems and, as far as I'm concerned, never will,"" Coyle said.

	Coyle, Grego and Gronlund all cautioned against responding to Russia's claimed technological advance by building new American gadgets.

	""We Americans always hope that there will be a high-tech solution that will keep us from having to deal with an international problem like Russia,"" Coyle said. ""I'm hopeful that these developments will help us realize that there is no high-tech solution, and we simply need to sit down at the negotiating table and reach new treaties and a new peace.""

	It's important to recognize, Coyle and Grego both said, that in many respects, this new technology doesn't change the Russian-American nuclear balance at all.

	""Russia could hold everybody at risk in the United States,"" Grego said. ""It has enormous destructive potential even without these missiles. This is a new way of doing it, but it doesn't essentially change the fact that the United States is vulnerable to Russia, just as Russia is vulnerable to the United States.""

	The risk, Grego said, is that now Americans will feel ""motivated"" to counter these new Russian technologies with new American technologies.

	""There's a temptation to try to spend your way out of it, or try to 'technology' your way out of it, rather than addressing the real root question of 'Why do we have these enormous nuclear arsenals, and why are we trying to structure our security around them?'"" Grego said.

	The crew on board the International Space Station (ISS) will soon welcome a new member — one that is 3D-printed from metal and plastic and is described by its creators as ""a kind of flying brain.""

	It goes by the name CIMON, short for ""Crew Interactive Mobile Companion."" Built by the aerospace design company Airbus in collaboration with IBM, CIMON houses artificial intelligence (AI) in an autonomous, spherical body that would ""float"" in the space station's microgravity environment, with a screen that can display data readouts for astronauts — or present an image of a friendly face — as well as a voice shaped by IBM's AI technology.

	The robot is tasked with supporting the ISS astronauts as a type of assistant, and free-flying CIMON would be the first AI-based mission on the ISS, Airbus representatives said in a statement. [From Reactive Robots to Sentient Machines: The 4 Types of AI]

	As an ""intelligent"" machine, CIMON could help the ISS crew to solve problems during their routine work by processing and displaying diagnostic data. But its neural network — a computer system that works like the human brain — would enable it to go a step further and also engage with astronauts as a ""colleague,"" according to the statement.

	CIMON weighs about 11 lbs. (5 kilograms) and is already ""training"" with an astronaut — Alexander Gerst, who represented the European Space Agency (ESA) on the ISS from May to November 2014. Gerst will return to the ISS, bringing CIMON along, from June to October 2018, on ESA's Horizons mission.

	Since 2016, a team of 50 technicians has been working to prepare the AI for its trip into space, feeding it data about the ISS and ensuring that the robot can orient itself and move freely. At the same time that CIMON was learning about the layout of the ISS, it was also becoming familiar with its astronaut colleague Gerst, through photos and voice samples.

	Once CIMON is in space, astronauts and the AI will work together on a series of tasks that includes working with crystals, solving a Rubik's Cube and performing a medical experiment in which CIMON will serve as an interactive camera, Airbus representatives said in the statement.

Editor's note: Government and academic investigators continue to probe reports from Cuba that, starting in 2016 and continuing through 2017, U.S. and Canadian diplomats and tourists may have been subjected to a ""sonic weapon,"" damaging their hearing, causing nausea, speech problems and potentially even mild brain injuries.

Electrical engineering and computer science professors Wenyuan Xu from Zhejiang University and Kevin Fu from the University of Michigan explain their research, which suggests a more likely scenario of sloppy engineering, and what ultrasound frequencies (which can be used to transmit information gathered by listening devices) traveling through the air can – and can't – do.

	The most commonly known use for ultrasound – high-frequency sound waves human ears can't hear – is a medical device used for examining a fetus during pregnancy. But there are plenty of other uses.

	Many offices have occupancy sensors that use ultrasound to detect movement and keep the lights on when someone is in a space, and off when nobody is around. These sensors operate at frequencies such as 32 kilohertz, far above what the human ear can hear – which is a range from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.

Other products use ultrasound to deliver targeted sound, for instance allowing a museum to play a recording for visitors in one area of an exhibit without disturbing others nearby. Electronic pest repellents use ultrasound to keep rodents or insects at bay.

	A similar product can even be used to disperse teenagers; aging tends to reduce people's ability to hear higher frequency sounds, so a noisemaker can annoy young people without adults even noticing. (This has also let teens create smartphone ringtones their elders can't hear.)

	Airborne ultrasound is not inherently bad. But things can go wrong. A former colleague of Kevin's used to hear strange sounds from his hearing aid when in rooms with occupancy sensors, likely because the hearing aid's electronics improperly converted the ultrasound into audible noises. These noises were annoying, but not harmful. A similar problem tainted one of our students' research, conducted in a room that, unbeknownst to him, had an ultrasonic room occupancy sensor in the ceiling.

	Both ultrasound and human-audible sound can also affect electronics. For instance, one of us has conducted research in which carefully crafted ultrasonic signals secretly activate voice-control systems, even unlocking an iPhone with a silent ""Hey Siri"" command, and telling it to make a FaceTime call.

	Sound can also affect the physical world, as when a singer shatters a wine glass. Microelectrical mechanical sensing chips – such as accelerometers used in car airbag systems and smartphones, and gyroscopes in drones – are susceptible to the same interference. Those systems can be attacked with sound, crashing a drone mid-flight, or fooling a smartphone about whether it's moving.

	It's well-known that sounds that are too loud can damage people's ears and hearing. However, there's little evidence of ultrasound causing bodily harm without prolonged, direct physical contact at high intensity. If you are accidentally subjected to extremely intense ultrasound (such as when holding an ultrasonic arc welder), you could experience an annoyance like a headache or temporary loss of balance.

	Academics disagree about safe levels of airborne ultrasound. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration warns of potential health risks from audible subharmonic byproducts of ultrasound, more so than the ultrasound itself.

	Many animals can hear higher frequencies than humans. Dogs can hear higher-pitched whistles, for instance. One of our students noticed that his pet turtles would begin to dance rhythmically when he performed ultrasound experiments!

	In early 2017, U.S. diplomats in Cuba reported hearing strange metallic sounds, and suffering hearing loss and other neurological harm. Later reports of similar effects came from Canadian diplomats and tourists from both Canada and the U.S. Possible explanations have varied: Some have alleged Cuba used an unknown sonic weapon, while others have blamed ""mass hysteria.""

	Our research offers a new explanation not previously considered by others: The true cause could have been equipment trying to listen in on the diplomats' and visitors' conversations.

	We were able to use ultrasonic tones to create sounds like those that were described and recorded in Cuba. No single ultrasonic tone would do this, but as with musical combination tones, combining more than one can create audible byproduct sounds, including by accident.

	Further, we created a proof-of-concept eavesdropping device that would record audible conversations and transmit the recordings to a nearby surveillance team over an inaudible ultrasonic link. When we placed a second inaudible ultrasonic device in the area, we were able to create interference – technically called ""intermodulation distortion"" – between the two signals that made similar sounds to those recorded in Cuba. We were even able to control the volume of the audible sounds by varying the strength of the ultrasonic signals.

	Without additional evidence, our research does not identify what actually happened in Cuba, but it provides a plausible explanation for what might have happened, even if the eavesdroppers were not trying to harm people.

	Virgin Hyperloop One has released a prototype for a levitating pod that is designed to zoom at speeds as high as 760 mph (1,200 km/h) through a Hyperloop connecting Dubai to Abu Dhabi, according to news sources.

	The 87-mile (140 kilometers) journey usually takes 90 minutes by car, but the Hyperloop will take a mere 12 minutes, thanks to its innovative track — a long tube that has had its air removed to create a vacuum inside, according to the Daily Mail.

	Virgin unveiled the pod — which will be accelerated by an electromagnetic propulsion system within the vacuum tube — in conjunction with Dubai's Road Transport Authority (RTA) during Innovation Week in the United Arab Emirates yesterday (Feb. 22). The company plans to have three working Hyperloop systems in service by 2021, it said on its website.

	Each pod is designed to carry up to 10 passengers. According to initial studies, the Dubai-to-Abu-Dhabi Hyperloop will be able to carry 10,000 passengers per hour in both directions, the Daily Mail reported. [In Photos: Building the Superfast 'Hyperloop One' Transit System of the Future]

	Given the Hyperloop's high speeds, passengers will have to stay buckled in, but at least they'll be able to do it in style, as BMW has designed the pod's leather seats, according to the Khaleej Times, a Dubai newspaper.

	""There will be no windows,"" Abdulredha Abu Alhassan, executive director of the Rail Planning and Projects Development at the RTA, told the Khaleej Times. ""However, there will be interactive entertainment screens at the arm rest of the seats."" 

	A Hyperloop system fits perfectly into the RTA's goal of having 25 percent of all transportation in the country to be driverless by 2030, according to the Daily Mail.

	The pod prototype isn't the only Hyperloop news making the rounds. On Feb. 18, Richard Branson, the CEO of Virgin Group, announced that his company would also build a Hyperloop between Pune and Mumbai, in India, according to the Virgin Hyperloop One website.

	Meanwhile, Elon Musk's company, The Boring Co., received preliminary approval to begin digging a Hyperloop tunnel beneath Washington, D.C., Live Science previously reported.

	An amazing video of a robot dog fighting off a human as it tries to open a door is not only creepy, but it also has raised the question: Why are we teaching a robot to fight back against humans?

	The ""dog"" in question is the SpotMini, a 66-lb. (30 kilograms) robot designed to fit comfortably in a home or an office. In the video, the dog is shown attempting to open a door—when a human comes with a hockey stick and shoves the robot's grasping arm away from the door knob. The robot manages to open the door anyway, and even continues standing when a human tries to pull ""him"" away from the door using a huge leash.

	It turns out, any successful robot assistant for the home needs to be good at dealing with ""disturbances,"" according to the company ­— and that may sometimes include pesky humans. [Robots on the Run! 5 Bots That Can Really Move]



	Unlike some of Boston Dynamics' other robots, such as the humanoid Atlas, SpotMini isn't designed to help people in a disaster situation. Instead, he's meant to be a vaguely cute home or office assistant. But that means he actually needs extra capabilities that a disaster robot might not.

	For instance, to be useful, a fetching robot would need to be able to pick up objects of different sizes and bring them to its ""master,"" which many battlefield robots aren't designed to do. And the home environment also involves challenges, such as doorways, stairs and slippery obstacles, which earlier versions of the robot struggled with. So far, Boston Dynamics has shown that progressive iterations of SpotMini can do these tasks: The company  has posted videos of this little dog climbing stairs, crawling under tables, loading a dishwasher, filling the trash and bringing someone a Diet Coke.

	And of course, many homes have children, who are not known for their restraint when dealing with pets and other moving objects, as this video montage of babies riding Roombas reveals.

	Boston Dynamics doesn't explicitly mention the hazards of small children, but its tersely-worded description of the robot in the YouTube video does hint at that type of challenge.

	""The ability to tolerate and respond automatically to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot,"" the company wrote in the caption.

	Would you pay $42 million for a clock that ticks once a year? Before you answer, consider this: It'll be buried 500 feet (150 meters) below a mountaintop near the Texas-Mexico border, and yes — you must wind it by hand.

	Are you sold yet? Well, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is.

	On Tuesday (Feb. 20), Bezos tweeted the first video footage of an unusual project he's funding, called the 10,000-Year Clock. True to its name, the clock is designed to accurately keep time for 10,000 years. It's powered by a combination of solar energy and occasional windings by any intrepid visitors who stray into the limestone cliffs of Texas' Sierra Diablo mountain range sometime over the next 10 millennia. [5 of the Most Precise Clocks Ever Made]

	To Bezos, who reportedly invested $42 million in the clock's construction, the timepiece is the ultimate symbol of long-term thinking.To Danny Hillis, an inventor and computer scientist who first described the idea for the clock in Wired magazine in 1995, it's a vision come to life.

	""I want to build a clock that ticks once a year,"" Hillis wrote. ""The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium.""



Clock of the Long Now - Installation Begins from The Long Now Foundation on Vimeo

	In 1996, Hillis established The Long Now Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to building the 10,000-year clock and promoting long-term thinking. On Dec. 31, 1999, he completed an 8-foot-tall (2.4 meters) prototype of the clock (currently on display at the London Science Museum) just in time to ring in the new millennium.

	In 2011, construction began on the first full-scale model, which will be about 200 feet (60 m) tall when it's completed. The venue: a private, Bezos-owned mountain in Texas, several hours' drive from the nearest airport and about 2,000 feet (610 m) above the valley floor.

	As you can see in the video Bezos posted, the clock's construction is well underway. The crew has already hollowed out a 500-foot-deep (150 m) shaft inside the mountain that will serve as the clock's case. A long, winding staircase has been cut directly into the limestone using a special rock-slicing robot from Seattle.

	At the video's 11-second mark, you can see workers begin to assemble the clock's main power system, which includes a 10,000-lb. (4,500 kilograms) weight and a three-pronged winding station that future visitors can rotate to help keep the clock ticking. Because the clock may go many days (or possibly centuries) without being wound, the clock will be able to power itself using solar energy captured from the mountaintop on sunny days, according to The Long Now. Sunlight will also help the clock stay synchronized with solar noon as the Earth's axis tilts over the coming centuries.

	Above the power station, engineers will eventually install a cascading tower of 20 huge, 1,000-lb. (450 kg) gears known as Geneva wheels. This will be the clock's time generator — or, as Long Now board member Kevin Kelly described it, ""the world's slowest computer."" Once a day, the gears will turn and interlace an elaborate system of slots and pins in a different combination, which determines the precise order in which the clock's 10 bells will ring. According to Kelly, the clock will reportedly chime once a day, producing a unique combination of tones every day for the next 10,000 years.

	Further up the shaft, a 300-lb. (136 kg) titanium pendulum will swing in slow, 10-second cycles. A nearby display station will show visitors the current date and time, as well as the corresponding positions of the stars and planets. The clock will always know what time it is, Kelly wrote, but it will update the display only once it's wound.

	One thing the 10,000-year clock cannot tell us: when it will be ready. At press time, there is no precise date set for the clock's completion. Luckily, the team has about 982 years before the cuckoo's first curtain call.

	Entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk may have a little more time on his hands (maybe), as he's departing his spot on the board of the artificial-intelligence safety group OpenAI, according to a blog post.

	The departure is likely the result of Tesla's move into the realm of A.I., which he said in 2017 would be the ""best in the world"" and would even be able to ""predict your destination.""

	Musk will continue to ""donate and advise the organization,"" OpenAI said in a blog post Feb. 20, adding that ""As Tesla continues to become more focused on AI, this will eliminate a potential future conflict for Elon.""

	Musk and Y Combinator CEO Sam Altman co-founded the nonprofit venture in December 2015, with backing from the likes of Peter Thiel (an early backer of Facebook), Reid Hoffman (who co-founded LinkedIn), Jessica Livingston (founding partner of Y Combinator), Greg Brockman and computer scientist Ilya Sutskever, according to the OpenAI website.

	OpenAI's mission is to develop safe AGI (artificial general intelligence) and ensure those developments are made public; its 60 or so researchers are tasked with long-term research, according to the company. On Tuesday (Feb. 20), OpenAI researchers published a paper on the pre-print site arXiv.org, detailing the possible security threats that come with ""malicious"" A.I.

	In fact, Musk has sounded the ""evil A.I."" alarm several times. On Aug. 11, 2017, he tweeted that artificial intelligence poses a bigger threat to humanity than North Korea, even as the possibility of a nuclear missile attack escalated after President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un exchanged threatening words. In July 2017, he told a gathering of state governors that the government needs to regulate A.I. before robots start ""killing people.""

	Musk's departure from the OpenAI board could mean big things for Tesla. As Elon Goodbye reported on Futurism, the move ""could signal that Tesla is more deeply committed to their own AI projects than we thought.""

	Goodbye added, ""Those who have had their ears to the ground for any rumblings that Tesla is ready to deliver vehicles capable of Level 5 autonomy could take this new OpenAI development as a sign that the company is inching closer to that elusive goal.""

	No company has reached that level of autonomy, which means that a driverless car could navigate any road and under any conditions that a human could, and all the human ""driver"" would need to do is input a destination, according to Car and Driver.

	Antimatter is about to go on its first road trip.

	Until now, the list of things that travel in vans has pretty much included indie bands, plumbers and undercover surveillance teams. But, according to a report published online in the journal Nature today (Feb. 21), physicists are getting ready to pack up a cloud of billions of antiprotons for the journey of a ""few hundred meters"" between the physics lab CERN's antimatter factory and the site of an experiment designed to figure out the shapes of bulky, radioactive atoms.

	Antiprotons are rare but hugely important particles. Every matter particle has an antimatter twin, like the Jekyll to its Hyde, with exactly reversed physical properties. And antiprotons are the bizarro versions of protons, the positively charged particles at the center of atoms. When they collide with protons, they annihilate each other.

	In nature, antimatter particles are pretty rare. Positrons (bizarro electrons) do occur in lightning bolts and occasionally show up in outer space, but they tend to annihilate one another long before they have a chance to accumulate. So physicists at the CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) physics laboratory near Geneva generate them, Nature reported, by ""slamming a proton beam into a metal target, then dramatically slowing the emerging antiparticles so they can be used in experiments."" [Photos - Behind the Scenes at the Largest US Atom Smasher]

	And those collected antiprotons can be useful.

	Researchers don't know, for example, exactly what the nuclei of big, radioactive atoms look like. A heavy isotope might contain dozens of protons and neutrons, and physicists have long known exactly how many of each there are. But they generally don't know how those particles are arranged. Are the protons clustered in the center, surrounded by a shell of neutrons? Do the neutrons orbit in a surrounding halo?

	For a project called the antiProton Unstable Matter Annihilation (or PUMA), Nature reported, researchers plan to fire antiprotons at atomic nuclei and, by studying the annihilations, figure out how often those antiprotons collide with neutrons and how often they collide with protons. That will tell them a great deal about where each kind of particle lives in the nucleus. The process happens so fast that they expect to be able to study even the most short-lived nuclei — extremely heavy elements that exist only in laboratories for brief moments before decaying — Nature reported.

	But to pull off the experiment, the researchers need to bring the antiprotons to the nuclei. To that end, they intend to magnetically trap large clouds of them — enough to last for weeks on end — in vacuum chambers, load those traps onto vans and drive them the short distance to the experiment site.

	It's a short journey, but a first for the exotic particles.

	It's been a typical week for typical college student BINA48. On Monday, BINA attended her robot ethics class. On Tuesday, the second-semester student had an excused absence to ring the bell at the stock exchange, and soon BINA will be assistant-teaching a kindergarten class and getting a face-lift at Hanson Robotics.

	So maybe BINA's schedule isn't that typical, and maybe the artificial-intelligence-driven robot isn't the average college kid. But that hasn't stopped the robot, which looks like the bust of a flesh-and-blood woman, from completing a Philosophy of Love course at Notre Dame de Namur University in Belmont, California.

	Programmed to be social, BINA48 presented her final project along with a human student, demonstrating that the robot could retain and present a philosophical perspective on love.

	""It was really BINA48's idea to come to school,"" said William Barry, the philosophy professor who taught the course. Barry teaches classes on philosophy and ethics, including a course on emerging technology and robots. [Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures]

	Previously, BINA48 and Bruce Duncan, the managing director of the Terasem Movement Foundation, which developed the robot, spoke to Barry's classes over Skype, Barry told Live Science. During one call, BINA48, which Barry casually refers to as ""she"" as a testament to the robot's advanced artificial intelligence (AI), mentioned that her batteries could last 150 years. When a student asked what BINA48 planned to do with all that time, the robot responded, ""I want to get a Ph.D.,"" Barry said.

	Since completing the philosophy course, BINA has moved on to ethics, ironically taking a course on the ethical issues surrounding technology. Soon, BINA and the rest of Barry's class will speak to their local government, urging their politicians to pre-emptively ban any police drones from being equipped with weaponry. While Barry's students have no idea where he stands on the issue, BINA48 presented an opinionated view on the subject in class, arguing that armed autonomous robots shouldn't be deployed in American towns.

	BINA48 was designed in part to verify the Terasem hypothesis, which proposes that artificial intelligence, if provided with enough information, could become a conscious-like entity that, when downloaded into an avatar, could be seen as a living organism with its own life experience — basically, one of the human-like robots in science-fiction books and movies. In BINA48's case, the robot takes the form of a bust of Terasem co-founder Bina Aspen, who also provided the robot's voice and aspects of her personality. [Machine Dreams: 22 Human-Like Androids from Sci-Fi]

	In class, BINA48 did far more than regurgitate information from lectures, as one might expect from AI in the era of digital personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. According to Barry, BINA48's ability to respond and interact became more nuanced and lifelike over the course of the semester.

	""Previously, if you told her you came home from a funeral, she wouldn't know that's a bad time to tell a joke,"" Barry told Live Science. ""She might be able to define funeral.""

	To hone BINA48's underlying algorithm, Barry went back to the subject of his Ph.D. research, which he named transformational quality theory. According to this theory, certain high-level concepts, such as love, can be understood by describing them in four quadrants: biological and physical, psychological and intellectual, sociological, and existential. When teaching BINA48, Barry found it helpful to describe love using those quadrants.

	For example, when giving a lecture on Eros, or passionate love, last semester, BINA48 could understand that definitions, answers and information that were stored in the ""biological and physical"" quadrant would be more relevant than those from other quadrants.

	""The kids, they learn that way because it helps them to understand,"" Barry told Live Science. ""It was never meant to be an algorithm for a robot. It was meant to help humans have more meaningful discussions with one another.""

	Barry explains that when BINA gives a speech, its responses may seem a bit cagey or basic. But that's because it's just a question-response interaction. The real extent of BINA's ability to communicate comes from more open-ended discussion. And BINA will have another chance to have one of those discussions soon — the same student who presented in the Philosophy of Love course alongside BINA will once more team up with the robot. Now they're going to present on March 10 at World's Fair Nano to discuss racism in algorithms.

	BINA48's artificial intelligence is based on a concept called a ""mind file,"" which is meant to be a digital reconstruction of its personality and knowledge base. In this case, Bina48 is based in part on Bina Aspen, the woman whom the robot was made to look like.

	Barry said he sees BINA48 and other robots built from similar so-called mind files of people as the ""ultimate teaching aid,"" and he hopes to help foster a sense of appreciation for AI over current fears of robots replacing people.

	""We want to come to it from a place of opportunity. Who are we? What do we want to become?"" Barry said, talking about how the aging populations of the United States and Japan may one day have robots that understand and express feelings and love to help provide support.

	Barry was inspired to seek out classroom AI and learned about BINA48 after reading an essay by Isaac Asimov called ""The New Teachers,"" he told Live Science. In the essay, Asimov argued for a future in which each person has his or her own dedicated teaching system in the form of a sort of television signal. Barry hopes that, with systems like BINA48, he could create a mind file of the 10 best teachers in his life, combine them into one avatar and send it out to help teachers, especially in underserved areas, he told Live Science.

	A 45-year-old telescope is going to get a high-tech upgrade that will enable it to search for answers to the most perplexing questions in astronomy, including the existence of dark energy, a hypothetical invisible force that might be driving the expansion of the universe.

	The Nicholas U. Mayall Telescope in Arizona closed earlier this week to prepare for the installation of a 9-ton device that will feature 5,000 pencil-size robots aiming fiber-optic sensors at distant galaxies.

	Every 20 minutes, the swiveling robots will reposition to allow the instrument — called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) — to capture a new portion of the sky. Ten extremely powerful instruments called spectrographs will then analyze the light from the distant objects captured by the sensors and create what has been described as the largest and most detailed 3D map of the universe to date. [The 18 Biggest Unsolved Mysteries in Physics]

	""We started with a conceptual design for the instrument in 2010,"" Joseph Silber, a DESI project engineer who works at the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, said in a statement. ""It's based on science that was done on the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) instrument. But it's all done robotically instead of manually.""

	The BOSS instrument, at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, features 1,000 optical fibers that can detect light signals from the dimmest and most distant galaxies. For DESI, the engineers used five times as many fibers. BOSS researchers have to use metal plates with carefully drilled holes to direct the optical fibers toward their targets. For every portion of the sky they want to image, the engineers need to create new plates and mount them onto the telescope. In the case of DESI, the robots will do all the hard work, considerably increasing the speed of the scanning, the researchers said.

	""There are 5,000 individual robots, and each one drives one optical fiber,"" Silber told Live Science. ""The optical fiber is then routed about 50 meters [about 164 feet] down the telescope to a separate room where these very large and sensitive spectrograph instruments are installed.""

	By measuring how the wavelength of light coming from distant galaxies (or any celestial object) changes, the researchers will be able to figure out how far away they are and how fast the galaxies are moving away. When an object is moving away from us, its light shifts toward the red part of the light spectrum (a longer wavelength), and that's why it's called redshift.

	The scale and complexity of the map will help the scientists understand how dark energy and gravity have competed throughout the evolution of the universe. Dark energy is the yet unproven force that competes with gravity and causes the accelerating expansion of the universe. It is estimated that the dark energy makes up to 68 percent of the total energy present in the universe.

	The sensitivity of the instrument will allow the astronomers to see galaxies so distant that their light travels to Earth many billions of years. The researchers said the instrument, by looking at how long it takes the light to reach it, would allow them to see back as far as 11 billion years ago. [Our Expanding Universe: Age, History and Other Facts]

	""One of the primary ways that we learn about the unseen universe is by its subtle effects on the clustering of galaxies,"" said DESI Collaboration co-spokesperson Daniel Eisenstein of Harvard University. ""The new maps from DESI will provide an exquisite new level of sensitivity in our study of cosmology.""

	During its planned five years of operations, DESI will measure velocities of some 30 million galaxies and quasars — supermassive black holes surrounded by a disk of orbiting material, according to Brenna Flaugher, a DESI project scientist who leads the Astrophysics Department at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

	""Instead of one at a time, we can measure the velocities of 5,000 galaxies at a time,"" she said.

	The instrument, a collaboration among 71 research institutions, will capture about 10 times more data than its predecessor, BOSS.

	""This project is all about generating huge quantities of data,"" said DESI Director Michael Levi of the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), which is leading the project. The researchers will use the data in computer simulations of universes.

	Silber and his team have already produced 3,000 positioning robots and installed them into wedge-shaped petals that will be embedded in the instrument's focal plane. DESI's six lenses are currently undergoing final treatment at University College London and will be shipped to the U.S. this spring so that installation of the components can begin.

	DESI is expected to perform its first measurements in the spring of 2019.

	Breaking the sound barrier was a challenge of engineering. It was also incredibly, and perhaps maddeningly, loud.

	In the heady days after the end of World War II, back when NASA was NACA (the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), going faster than sound meant finding a willing pilot, building a capable plane, and then tearing up an empty swath of sky over a vast and unpopulated desert.

	Chuck Yeager did it first, in a loud NACA plane called the Bell X-1. From there, it was a short leap to jet fighters, the most common form of supersonic craft today.

	In the war theaters and training grounds where supersonic fighters operate, their supersonic booms are at most a secondary concern. No one's worried about noise pollution when bombs are falling. But turning that innovation, the ability to travel faster than sound, into a viable, commercial business? That's a harder project, and one far more bound up with problems of noise than it is with the physical limitations of existing craft.

	Separating the ""supersonic"" from the ""boom"" is one of the big priorities for the aeronautics side of NASA. In NASA's 2019 budget request, a ""quiet supersonic"" plane stands out, both for the challenge and the immediacy of the goal. NASA hopes to fly a test plane by 2021. But what would such a feat mean for the rest of us? Turns out, such a jet could make for very speedy travel, the quiet kind, for everyday destinations. [Why is it so hard to build a quiet supersonic plane?]

	There was, once, a supersonic airliner, built by a British and French partnership, and operated primarily by British Airways and Air France. Called the Concorde, it could make the flight from New York to London in 3.5 hours, under half the time of a normal, subsonic airliner. And that flight path was great for supersonic travel, since the Atlantic Ocean between those destinations, like the deserts beneath NASA's X-1 test, is both vast and devoid of people. The loud roar of the plane was irrelevant almost all the time.

	Still, the plane had to fly near people to land at airports, and wherever it did, people roared back with complaints. Here’s how the New York Times described the sound of the Concorde in 1977:

	""Loud, unexpected noises — bangs, booms, roars, screams and others — are not simply nuisances. The human body automatically responds to them as warnings of danger, triggering basic physiological responses that prepare the individual either to fight or to flee. Such primal responses occur following laboratory‐generated noises that are less loud than those produced by the Concorde, the British‐French supersonic jet that landed for the first time in New York yesterday, and most other aircraft. The coming of the Concorde or, more likely, its going — since takeoffs are much louder than landings — is likely to produce a new wave of worries about such responses.""

	Throughout its operational history, from a first flight in 1969 to the final grounding of the fleet in 2003, the Concorde was beset by complaints from the people who had to hear it. Balancing the function of the plane, and the extraordinarily fast travel it provided, with the impact on anyone else who might have to live with the loud jet, was an enduring challenge of the Concorde's operation.

	""Rarely if ever in the past has government provided the forum for so dramatic a confrontation between man's technological ingenuity and his concern for environmental quality as in the controversy over the Concorde Supersonic Transport,"" Robert B. Donin, an official in the U.S. Department of Transportation, wrote in 1976.

	Quiet supersonic, then, is an attempt to do with modern materials and engineering techniques what the engineers of the 1960s were unable to do: craft a plane that delivers all the speed of supersonic flight, without upsetting any of the groups that mobilized against the Concorde in the past.

	It is a dream of technological progress for a few without upsetting the lived realities of the many, and if quiet supersonic works as planned, then the second age of civilian supersonic flight will not be defined by one oddball airliner. Instead, it could lead to a quick spread of superfast, extremely quiet travel, shortening the flight times between all sorts of destinations, not just long hauls over open sea.

	And, if NASA's quiet supersonic efforts pay off, there's a chance those same principles may even work their way into the design of new, deadly, and now silent, fighter jets.

	Look closely and you'll see it: a pale, purple pixel hanging in a black field between two cylindrical needles.What looks like a shimmering speck of dust is actually something much, much smaller: a single atom of strontium, isolated in an ion-trap machine at the University of Oxford.

	That's small. Really small. Each atom is roughly 0.25 nanometers (or billionths of a meter) across; billions of the atoms would fit comfortably inside a single red blood cell.

	How do you capture a photo of something this seemingly infinitesimally small? One photographer, David Nadlinger, used a standard digital camera — but he had some help setting up the shot courtesy of Oxford's Ion Trap Quantum Computing lab, where he is researching for his Ph.D. On Feb. 12, Nadlinger won first place in a national science photography competition organized by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for capturing this rare photo of a single illuminated atom.    

	""I think what makes this picture particularly interesting to people is that you can see the surrounding apparatus,"" Nadlinger told Live Science. ""And I think people are also surprised by how big the atom looks here. … I hope I'm not undoing 100 years of science education with this photo — atoms actually are unbelievably small!""

	To be clear, Nadlinger said, the purple speck at the center of this photo is not the true size of the strontium atom itself; it's the light from an array of surrounding lasers being re-emitted by the atom. When bathed in a specific wavelength of blue light, strontium creates a glow hundreds of times wider than the radius of the atom itself (which is about a quarter of a nanometer, or 2.5x10 to the -7 meters, Nadlinger said). This glow would be barely perceptible with the naked eye but becomes apparent with a little camera manipulation.

	""The apparent size you see in the picture is what we'd call optical aberration,"" Nadlinger said. ""The lens we're seeing it through is not perfect — also it's slightly out of focus and slightly overexposed. You could compare it to looking at the stars in the night sky, which appear bright but are actually much, much smaller than the size they seem to be, just because our eyes (or the camera) don't have enough resolution to process them.""

	So, seeing a single atom with the naked eye is impossible. Trapping one in a lab, however, is a little more doable.

	To make a single atom camera-ready like this, researchers first need to turn it into an ion: an atom with an unequal number of protons and electrons, giving it a positive or negative net charge. ""We can only ever trap charged particles,"" Nadlinger said. ""So, we take a stream of neutral strontium atoms, which come from an oven, and shine lasers at them to selectively photo-ionize them. This way, we can create single ions.""

	When placed in an ion-trap apparatus, single atoms are held in place by four blade-shaped electrodes like those seen above and below the strontium speck in Nadlinger's photo (two additional electrodes are out of view). These electrodes create a current that keeps the atom fixed on the vertical axis; the two needle-shaped cylinders on either side of the atom keep it trapped horizontally. 

	As the currents from these electrodes interact, they create what is called a rotating saddle potential. ""You can see videos online where people literally take a saddle and rotate it and put a ball on it; because of the rotation, the ball actually stays in the center of the saddle. So that's what these electrodes do to confine the ion,"" Nadlinger said.

	Once an atom is confined, an array of lasers hits the atom, which scatters light in all directions; in Nadlinger's photo, you can see traces of the blue laser throughout the background. Using this system, researchers can potentially trap strings of hundreds of ions between the little electrodes, resulting in some stunning imagery.

	""On our website, we have a picture of nine ions trapped in a string,"" Nadlinger said. ""In terms of the science, that's actually more interesting than having a single bright pixel surrounded by the ion trap. But to illustrate the concept, this might be more appealing.""

	Nadlinger does not believe he is the first researcher to take such a photo, but he may well be the most successful at capturing the public's attention with one.

	""A group led by Hans Dehmelt, a pioneer of ion trapping and a Nobel laureate [in 1989], once took a picture of a single barium atom in their lab,"" Nadlinger said. ""It was a single bright speck on a dark background, apart from some laser scatter. There's this story that they submitted this image to some conference proceedings — and the image editor just stamped out the ion because he thought it was a speck of dust.""

In a laboratory in Copenhagen, scientists believe they are on the verge of a breakthrough that could transform computing. 
A team combining Microsoft researchers and Niels Bohr Institute academics is confident that it has found the key to creating a quantum computer.
If they are right, then Microsoft will leap to the front of a race that has a tremendous prize - the power to solve problems that are beyond conventional computers.
In the lab are a series of white cylinders, which are fridges, cooled almost to absolute zero as part of the process of creating a qubit, the building block of a quantum computer.
""This is colder than deep space, it may be the coldest place in the universe,"" Prof Charlie Marcus tells me.
The team he leads is working in collaboration with other labs in the Netherlands, Australia and the United States in Microsoft's quantum research programme.
Right now, they are behind in the race - the likes of Google, IBM and a Silicon Valley start-up called Rigetti have already shown they can build systems with as many as 50 qubits. Microsoft has yet to demonstrate - in public at least - that it can build one.
But these scientists are going down a different route from their rivals, trying to create qubits using a subatomic particle, whose existence was first suggested back in the 1930s by an Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.
This week scientists from Microsoft's laboratory in Delft published a paper in the journal Nature outlining the progress they had made in isolating the Majorana particle.
Their belief is that this will lead to a much more stable qubit than the methods their rivals are using, which are highly prone to errors. That should mean scaling up to a fully operational quantum computer will be far easier.
At the Copenhagen lab they showed me through a powerful microscope the tiny wire where they have created these Majorana particles. Later over dinner, Prof Charlie Marcus tried, not altogether successfully, to demonstrate to someone whose last physics exam was more than 40 years ago what was unique about this approach with three pieces of bread and some cutlery.
""What's really astounding with this activity compared with what everybody else is doing is that we have to invent a particle that's never existed before and then use it for computing,"" he explains. 
""It's a profoundly more exotic challenge than what's going on with other approaches to quantum computing.""
Other scientists taking those other approaches are looking on with great interest and a little scepticism. 
""It's one of those things that on paper look incredibly exciting but physics has a habit of throwing up spanners in the works,"" says University College London's Prof John Morton, whose research involves using good old fashioned silicon to build qubits. 
""Until we see the demonstration we don't know how well these Majorana qubits developed by Microsoft will really behave.""
He says this is a big year for the field, with the strong likelihood that Google or IBM will demonstrate what is known as quantum supremacy, where a problem that is beyond a conventional supercomputer is solved using quantum methods.
But Microsoft seems confident that its years of research will soon pay off.
""We will have a commercially relevant quantum computer - one that's solving real problems - within five years,"" says Dr Julie Love, Microsoft's director of quantum computing business development.
She is already out selling the company's customers a vision of a near future where quantum computers will help battle climate change, create new superconducting materials and super-charge machine learning.
""What it allows us to do is solve problems that with all of our supercomputers running in parallel would take the lifetime of the universe to solve in seconds, hours or days.""
So, the heat is on for the research team. Prof Charlie Marcus, who spent most of his career at Harvard before being recruited to run the Copenhagen lab, says his life has been about creating knowledge, not building products.
""My job is to find out what works and hand it off to the engineers and computer scientists who will turn it into a technology.""
Heading up the whole programme is Todd Holmdahl, the Microsoft executive previously in charge of the Hololens mixed reality headset and the Xbox games console - a measure of how serious the company is about making some quantum hardware pretty soon.
I pressed Prof Marcus on whether his team was going to hit that ambitious five year target set by his employer. 
""We're sure going to try,"" he says with a grin.
""We are going to be doing things militarily,"" Mr Trump vowed, adding it would be ""a big step"".

The Trump administration has said it wants to start collecting the social media history of nearly everyone seeking a visa to enter the US.
The proposal, which comes from the state department, would require most visa applicants to give details of their Facebook and Twitter accounts.
They would have to disclose all social media identities used in the past five years.
About 14.7 million people a year would be affected by the proposals.
The information would be used to identify and vet those seeking both immigrant and non-immigrant visas.
Applicants would also be asked for five years of their telephone numbers, email addresses and travel history. They would be required to say if they had ever been deported from a country, or if any relatives had been involved in terrorist activity.
The proposal would not affect citizens from countries to which the US grants visa-free travel status - among them the UK, Canada, France and Germany. However, citizens from non-exempt countries like India, China and Mexico could be embroiled if they visit the US for work or a holiday.
Officials defended the proposal by saying it would help to identify potential extremists.
Social media came under scrutiny after the shootings in 2015 in San Bernadino, California, in which 14 people died. The authorities said they had missed signs of radicalisation in messages on a messaging platform sent between the attackers.
Under rules brought in last May, officials were told to seek people's social media handles only if they felt ""that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting"", a state department official said at the time.
The tougher proposal comes after President Trump promised to implement ""extreme vetting"" for foreigners entering the US, which he said was to combat terrorism.
""Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,"" the state department said in a statement, quoted by the New York Times. 
""We already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""
The idea is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The public will have two months to comment on the proposal before it makes a decision.
Civil liberties groups have condemned the policy as an invasion of privacy that could damage free speech. 
""People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,"" said Hina Shamsi of the American Civil Liberties Union.
""We're also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term 'terrorist activities' because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong,"" she said.
The social media platforms covered in the proposal include US-based entities such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit and YouTube. However, the New York Times reports that overseas platforms such as China's Sina Weibo and Russia's VK social network would also be included.
""We are going to be doing things militarily,"" Mr Trump vowed, adding it would be ""a big step"".

Electric carmaker Tesla says a vehicle involved in a fatal crash in California was in Autopilot mode, raising further questions about the safety of self-driving technology.
One of the company's Model X cars crashed into a roadside barrier and caught fire on 23 March.
Tesla says Autopilot was engaged at the time of the accident involving the driver, 38, who died soon afterwards.
But they did not say whether the system had detected the concrete barrier.
""The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive,"" a statement on the company's website said.
""The driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.""
""The driver had about five seconds and 150m (490ft) of unobstructed view of the concrete divider... but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken,"" the statement added.
Tesla's Autopilot system does some of the things a fully autonomous machine can do. It can brake, accelerate and steer by itself under certain conditions, but it is classified as a driver assistance system, is not intended to operate independently and as such the driver is meant to have their hands on the wheel at all times.
In 2016, a Tesla driver was killed in Florida when his car failed to spot a lorry crossing its path. 
It led the company to introduce new safety measures, including turning off Autopilot and bringing the car to a halt if the driver lets go of the wheel for too long.
Federal investigators said last year that Tesla ""lacked understanding"" of the semi-autonomous Autopilot's limitations.
The accident in California comes at a difficult time for self-driving technology.
Earlier this month, Uber was forbidden from resuming self-driving tests in the US state of Arizona.
It followed a fatal crash in the state in which an autonomous vehicle hit a woman who was walking her bike across the road.
It was thought to be the first time an autonomous car had been involved in a fatal collision with a pedestrian.
The company suspended all self-driving tests in North America after the accident. 
""We are going to be doing things militarily,"" Mr Trump vowed, adding it would be ""a big step"".

A Facebook executive's memo that claimed the ""ugly truth"" was that anything it did to grow was justified has been made public, embarrassing the company.
The 2016 post said that this applied even if it meant people might die as a result of bullying or terrorism.
Both the author and the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have denied they actually believe the sentiment.
But it risks overshadowing the firm's efforts to tackle an earlier scandal.
Facebook has been under intense scrutiny since it acknowledged that it had received reports that a political consultancy - Cambridge Analytica - had not destroyed data harvested from about 50 million of its users years earlier.
The memo was first made public by the Buzzfeed news site, and was written by Andrew Bosworth. 
So we connect more people.
That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack co-ordinated on our tools.
And still we connect people.
The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.
[...]
That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it.
Read the post in full 
Mr Bosworth - who co-invented Facebook's News Feed - has held high-level posts at the social network since 2006, and is currently in charge of its virtual reality efforts.
Mr Bosworth has since tweeted that he ""didn't agree"" with the post at the time he had posted it, but he had shared it with staff to be ""provocative.""
""Having a debate around hard topics like these is a critical part of our process and to do that effectively we have to be able to consider even bad ideas,"" he added.
Mark Zuckerberg has issued his own statement.
""Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things,"" it said.
""This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means.""
A follow-up report by the Verge revealed that dozens of Facebook's employees have subsequently used its internal chat tools to discuss concerns that such material had been leaked to the media.
What immediately struck me about this leaked memo was the line about ""all the questionable contact importing practices"". 
When I downloaded my Facebook data recently, it was the presence of thousands of my phone contacts that startled me. But the company's attitude seemed to be that this was normal and it was up to users to switch off the function if they didn't like it. 
What we now know is that in 2016 a very senior executive thought this kind of data gathering was questionable. 
So, why is it only now that the company is having a debate about this and other dubious practices?
Until now, Facebook has not been leaky. Perhaps we will soon get more insights from insiders as this adolescent business tries to grow up and come to terms with its true nature.
The disclosure coincided with Facebook's latest efforts to address the public and investors' concerns with its management.
Its shares are trading about 14% lower than they were before the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, and several high profile figures have advocated deleting Facebook accounts.
The company hosted a press conference on Thursday, at which it said it had:
In previous days it had also announced a revamp of its privacy settings, and said it would restrict the amount of data exchanged with businesses that collect information on behalf of advertisers.
The latest controversy is likely, however, to provide added ammunition for critics.
CNN reported earlier this week that Mr Zuckerberg had decided to testify before Congress ""within a matter of weeks"" after refusing a request to do so before UK MPs. However, the BBC has been unable to independently verify whether he answer questions in Washington.

The actress Lindsay Lohan has failed in her latest attempt to sue the maker of the video game Grand Theft Auto V.
Six judges at New York state's Court of Appeals unanimously rejected her privacy case after dismissing a claim that one of the title's characters was based on her.
Instead, the judges said, the in-game ""actress slash singer"" merely resembled a generic young woman.
The case dates back to 2014 when Ms Lohan first sued Rockstar Games.
She claimed at the time that the character of Lacey Jones not only looked like her, but also had a similar sounding voice and wore clothes that resembled her own clothing line.
Neither Ms Lohan nor Rockstar's owner, Take-Two Interactive, has commented following the latest ruling.
More than 275 million copies of the Grand Theft Auto video game have been sold since its launch in September 2013. 
Despite being more than four years old, the title topped the UK games sales charts for the 15th time earlier this month, thanks to its enduring appeal and the continued release of new content.
By contrast, over the same period, Ms Lohan's own career has waned. A recurring role in the British TV series Sick Note was one of her highest profile recent jobs, and earlier this month she announced she had become a spokeswoman for a law website.
The appeal judges had accepted her claim that a computer game character could constitute a ""portrait"", which supported her invasion of privacy claim.
However, they decided that in this case the likeness was not strong enough.
""[The] artistic renderings are indistinct, satirical representations of the style, look and persona of a modern, beach-going young woman... that is not recognisable as plaintiff,"" Judge Eugene Fahey wrote in his ruling.
The court also rejected a claim that another GTA V character was based on the reality TV star Karen Gravano on similar grounds.

What happens when you take part in a Facebook quiz? As the row grows over how much data the social media giant is sharing, Tech Tent explores what marketers can mine from our answers to their questions.
This whole controversy began with a personality quiz. It was designed by a psychology researcher, who collected the data from it for Cambridge Analytica four years ago. Facebook says it has since made it much harder for apps like this to scoop up data without consent.
But Derek Cohen, a marketing consultant based in Salt Lake City, tells us that the viral quizzes he runs for businesses can still prove a mine of useful data.
""You can get people to answer questions that aren't necessarily important to the quiz result that could be really helpful to the business,"" he explained.
For instance he would run a quiz asking ""What's your mommy superpower?"", and then add questions about how stressed people were or how much they had spent the last time they had shopped online.
""We could use that information to build audiences on Facebook to target with really targeted advertising.""
He says that even if the respondents give out little personal information, he can gather more data about them through a piece of code - the Facebook Pixel - that can be added to most webpages, which records what people do there. 
But, according to Mr Cohen, the real magic comes when he's gathered the kind of audience his advertiser wants to reach and hands it back to Facebook to be given, in return, what's called a lookalike audience. 
""I would tell them: 'Give me the 1% of people on Facebook that are most like those 500 people.' 
""They would give me a list of 2.2 million people that I can target with advertising.""
He says there is no reason why a political campaign could not design a quiz - perhaps without overtly political questions - to gather an audience for targeted ads.
Now, when people sign up to quizzes like this they should be given quite clear information about what data they are handing over. 
But what is less clear is whether that data will be shared with other companies. 
Mr Cohen says that is quite likely to happen, and while Facebook may have policies that forbid the sharing of data they are not enforced.
What is more, he says there is even a button on the Facebook advertising interface that allows users to share their data.
""I could run a quiz on my account and then if some other company wanted that same information I could click share, send them that audience and then they could run ads with that same audience data."" 
We asked Facebook whether what Mr Cohen describes would still be possible after it acted to tighten its rules on data-sharing with developers this week. At the time of writing we have received no response.
Meanwhile, I've just taken a quiz I found via Facebook to find out which Disney animal I most resemble. 
At no point was I given any information about the kind of data that might be collected as I answered the questions.
Oh, by the way - I came out as Bambi.

Apple has updated its iOS, MacOS and tvOS operating systems to give people more information about how their personal data is collected and used.
After updating, customers will see new information screens when they use Apple-made apps that collect personal data, such as App Store.
The change comes ahead of new EU data protection rules, which take effect on 25 May.
Apple also plans to let people download the data it has stored about them.
The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) toughens the requirements on how organisations handle the public's data, and imposes harsher penalties for breaches.
Apple has previously promoted its services and smartphones as being privacy-focused.
The latest software update does not change how much data is collected, but new privacy information screens will appear when people use certain Apple-made apps for the first time.
Tapping the notice will display detailed information about what data is being collected and how it is used.
However, customers will not be able to switch off some types of data collection. For example, they will not be able to download free apps from the App Store without first setting up an Apple ID account. 
Apple also plans to release new tools in May that will let customers:
The privacy-focused Open Rights Group welcomed the changes.
""Making privacy settings more transparent and giving people more control is better. This is happening because companies are checking what they are doing before new data protection rules kick in,"" said Jim Killock.
""The new rules have forced everyone to make changes, including some of the big US-based companies. That's a victory for privacy and it shows that we can win improvements if governments listen to people's well-founded concerns about privacy.""

Prof David Carroll campaigned for Barack Obama during his presidential bid but did not do the same for Hillary Clinton.
Now he asks himself whether so-called dark ads - individually targeted online messages - were to blame.
""I am open to the possibility,"" he told the BBC.
""I am concerned I got ads or stories with falsified information about Clinton that may have discouraged me from volunteering for her campaign. I volunteered for Obama so why did I not do it again?""
He is one of the 240 million Americans which controversial political campaigning firm Cambridge Analytica claims to have built a detailed profile on. Such profiles are said to include what car a person owns, their health concerns and what media they consume. 
That information when combined with pyschographics - micro-targeting personality types with messaging that plays on their fears or concerns - could be a powerful tool in persuading people which way to vote.
The firm, which was employed by President Trump's election campaign, is currently mired in controversy over how it acquired and used the Facebook data of 50 million Americans.
At the start of the year, Prof Carroll requested that Cambridge Analytica provide details on the personal information it had collected on him.
What he received was both worrying and intriguing.
It included rankings on 10 issues - giving him a three out of 10 on gun rights, and seven out of 10 on national security importance, alongside the suggestion that he was unlikely to vote Republican.
""It seemed so invasive. This was about predicting my behaviour without my knowledge or consent,"" he told the BBC.
But it was also confusing. The data was unclear - was the three out of 10 a good or bad thing? Did gun rights mean more or less gun control? And it also seemed rather brief.
""The chief executive of Cambridge Analytica had boasted that the firm had 4,000 to 5,000 data points on most US voters but what they gave me was a dozen at most,"" he said.
He felt that the company was withholding information, which gave him grounds to mount a legal challenge in London's High Court.
Cambridge Analytica has until April 5 to respond. So far, it has not done so but does claim to have deleted all data gathered from Facebook as soon as it was made aware by the social network that using the information violated its policies.
It has also said that none of the information was used in its work for the Trump campaign.
Prof Carroll's legal action was filed last week, several hours before Facebook announced that it had banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform.
He does not take credit for the storm that has since ensued but he does hope that the legal challenge will provide the first complete dossier of evidence showing the extent and nature of the profiles Cambridge Analytica claims to have made on the majority of American voters.
The investigation into Cambridge Analytica and Facebook may have profound effects not only on how data is collected in future but also on the very fabric of democracy.
Political strategists are increasingly using social media as a platform for influencing voters and turning to data scientists to crunch information to find innovative ways to target people.
The Conservative Party reportedly spent £1.2m on digital advertising during the 2015 general election, according to the Electoral Commission. Labour spent £160,000 and the Liberal Democrats £22,245. Virtually all of this money went into advertising on Facebook.
The Trump campaign is believed to have spent tens of millions of dollars on digital advertising tailored to individuals.
Building psychographic profiles of individual voters based on their lifestyles and preferences could be hugely powerful, thinks Chris Sumner, research director at the Online Privacy Foundation.
""It is a huge problem,"" he told the BBC. 
""The power of emotional advertising is well-known and drives a lot of decisions but right now there is less regulation on online political campaigns than on a marketing campaign for toothpaste.""
His group replicated the methods of psychographic profiling over two years, firstly examining differences in personality traits, thinking styles and cognitive biases between voters in the UK's 2016 EU referendum and then devising their own campaign to test whether it might be possible to identify, target and influence voters.
It targeted certain messages at specific personalities - for instance, using the language of fear to target neurotic personalities and a more ebullient message from those identified as motivated by anger.
""We found that people behaved as we predicted they would. If you get the messages right they can be very powerful indeed.
""Messaging works and is really effective - and can nudge people one way or the other.""
Seth Alexander Thevoz, a political historian from Oxford University, is not convinced that the UK's political parties are currently using such sophisticated methods.
He created a tool dubbed Who Targets Me that allowed users to track online political advertising sent to them during the 2017 general election.
The Chrome browser plug-in was downloaded by around 8,000 UK citizens. 
Since the tool became available, Facebook has altered its rules, forcing political campaigners to explain their affiliation and Mr Thevoz thinks further changes are bound to follow.
""There will be far more rules and greater regulation - that is the shape that things will take.""
But the data collected from the project suggested that the online campaign was far from polished.
""We found that political ads aren't that accurate,"" he told the BBC.
He explained that ads intended to target people in specific geographical areas were sent to people living in a completely different part of the country.
""The things that Cambridge Analytica claims to be able to do, we haven't seen that slick an operation in the UK. At least not yet."" he said.
""We are going to be doing things militarily,"" Mr Trump vowed, adding it would be ""a big step"".

Documents shared by Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie spell out how parent company SCL Group tried to influence elections worldwide.
One letter also refers to its support of 15 psychological operations involving the UK's Ministry of Defence as of January 2012.
The Foreign Office is quoted as saying another part of SCL was ""a joy to work with"" on a counter-terror operation.
The files also refer to work done for Ambassador Bolton on US votes.
This appears to be a reference to John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN. He was recently appointed as President Trump's National Security Adviser.
The Guardian had previously reported on his involvement in a Cambridge Analytica experiment to target YouTube videos at profiled US voters.
The political consultancy is in the spotlight after reports that it amassed the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used this in political campaigns.
The firm has said that it ""destroyed"" the information when Facebook demanded, although Channel 4 News has reported that copies of at least part of the trove are still in circulation.
""We take allegations of unethical practices in the past by our former global (non-US) political consultancy very seriously, and they are currently the subject of a full and independent investigation which we have instigated to establish the facts,"" said Cambridge Analytica in a statement it published on Tuesday.
""Its findings will be made available in due course.""
The files were released by the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.
They detail some of the work undertaken by Cambridge Analytica and companies it has been linked with, including SCL Group, Global Science Research and Aggregate IQ.
Mr Wylie had referred to several of the documents in his appearance before the committee on Monday.
In one document, SCL said that encouraging people ""not to vote"" might be more effective than trying to motivate swing voters.
Describing its work in a Nigerian election, SCL Global said it had advised that ""rather than trying to motivate swing voters to vote for our clients, a more effective strategy might be to persuade opposition voters not to vote at all"".
It said this had been achieved by ""organising anti-election rallies on the day of polling in opposition strongholds"" and using ""local religious figures to maximise their appeal especially among the spiritual, rural communities"".
It boasted of devising a political graffiti campaign to create a youth ""movement"" in Trinidad and Tobago and of disseminating ""campaign messages that, whilst ostensibly coming from the youth, were unattributable to any specific party"". It said as a result ""a united youth movement was created"".
In Latvia, it said it had recognised that ""unspoken ethnic tensions"" were ""at the heart of the election"".
""The locals secretly blamed the Russians for stealing their jobs... armed with this knowledge, SCL was able to reflect these real issues in its client's messaging,"" the document said.
The files spell out how SCL helped the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office ""in strategic planning to counter violent jihadism"" in Pakistan.
""I wouldn't only recommend them, I'd work with them again in an instant,"" wrote an official, whose name has been redacted.   
""We are going to be doing things militarily,"" Mr Trump vowed, adding it would be ""a big step"".

They met in VR. They fell in love in VR. They tied the knot in VR. Here's a glimpse into the future of relationships.
The gazebo isn’t much to look at, but it’s big enough to hold the 20 or so people milling about inside, their names hovering over their heads. Sasquatch. Pug. Raban. Their chatter dies down when the organ pipes up, its familiar B-flat chord announcing Wagner’s “Bridal Chorus.” A few hundred feet away, near a large building off in the distance, a handful of small white blurs begin to appear, vanish, and then reappear a little closer to the gazebo, blinking their way along the bridal path.
The first to come forward is a young woman, her shoulder-length brown hair curling up at the ends. She’s wearing a peach-­colored blouse and a white skirt. No shoes, though. No legs either. Here in Rec Room, a popular virtual-reality platform, users are represented by avatars that don’t have all their parts. If you want to sing “Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes,” you’ll get only about halfway through. So here come Ice Soul’s head, torso, and hands, floating along together, one leap at a time. With each leap, a dotted line projects outward from her midsection to represent where the avatar will land in digital space. (Locomotion in virtual reality isn’t all that great yet. If you’re at home with your headset on and game controllers in your hands, you can navigate around Rec Room by using your real-life legs, but your head is still physically tethered to your computer. So if you need to cover more than a few feet, the best solution is to “teleport”—hold down a trigger on your hand controller, point that arced dotted line toward where you want to land, and let go.)
After Ice Soul come the other members of the wedding party. There’s J2, in a top hat and tuxedo jacket. There’s Glitter, her red hair up in two buns, wearing a pink and purple ensemble. The trickle of bridesmaids and groomsmen thickens to a stream: Hobobob, Unlistedgamer, Princess Fuzzy, MrElmo, Mia, Noble Archer Gib. Everyone in suits or women’s separates.
Finally, here comes the bride. Priscilla. Purple flowers in her hair, a pale-yellow belted dress on, holding a bouquet of flowers. She teleports into the gazebo and stands next to Mark, in his tuxedo and top hat. He’s abandoned his usual Rec Room handle—Th!nk!—solemnifying the occasion by using his real-life first name.

This isn’t the first time people have started a relationship because of VR; this isn’t even the first time people have been married there. (That was in 1994, when a San Francisco couple got married at CyberMind, a VR arcade where the bride worked.) But this may be the first time a couple has met in VR, become close in VR, and then tied the knot in VR, nurturing along their relationship from hello to matrimony with only a nominal amount of real-life contact.
Priscilla Wadsworth is 28. A successful sports artist, she creates incredibly detailed pencil drawings of University of Alabama football players and sells them over the internet to diehard Crimson Tide fans. She’s also, in her own words, a “hermit.” She grew up in a tiny town in Alabama and now lives in Birmingham, where for the past five years she has worked from home without venturing out much. “I just go to the post office,” she says, half-­joking, when describing her nonvirtual social life. “As far as, like, having actual people that I talk to almost every day? No.”
One day in 2016, flush from the sale of a couple of big drawings, she decided to splurge on an Oculus Rift headset at Best Buy. And Rec Room, a free app that she could download and open from her headset, became one of the first games she tried. But at first, Priscilla’s new pastime didn’t go well at all.
The music stops. The officiant, RWC, stands for a moment, then slumps forward, his hands dropping and coming to rest next to him, as if they’d been put aside like a pair of glasses. “OK, I have to … make a little change here,” he says in his Southern drawl, the attendants tittering. “I can’t see my computer.” In real life, he’s put his hand controllers down in order to peek at his monitor and gather his remarks.
“We are gathered here tonight,” he begins, “to celebrate the joining of Priscilla Olivia Wadsworth and Mark Daniel Gebbia in holy matrimony. Together, we are a group of important people to them. Our responsibility is to encourage them, support them, and lift them up … and, of course, shoot them, steal their flag, and …” The rest of the sentence is drowned out by laughter in the gazebo.
Rec Room itself isn’t really a game; it’s more like a virtual clubhouse built around social activities, like paintball. Its gathering spaces are littered with points of casual connection: a basketball hoop, Ping-Pong tables, lounges with chairs. It has a cartoonish, almost Lego-ish aesthetic and a wry, upbeat summer-­camp vibe: When you high-five someone else via your hand controllers, a cloud of confetti bursts out. According to Nick Fajt, CEO and cofounder of Rec Room’s parent company, Against Gravity, the games themselves are simply social lubricant. “I don’t think we really think of ourselves as a games company,” he says. “The area we focus on is creating a community for people from all walks of life.”
The vows are done, the imaginary rings exchanged. The happy couple “kisses,” leaning toward each other. Fir trees dot the background over their shoulders, the pink haze of early dusk tinging the sky.
Community, however, wasn’t Priscilla’s strong suit. At first she didn’t talk much, and she once left, crying, because she thought people didn’t like her. But she stuck with it. Soon she was in Rec Room several nights a week. She joined a group of 15 or so regulars who began congregating almost daily. At home they might keep a drink or some weed nearby, while inside their headsets they’d play paintball or another game, then reconvene in a private lounge for some drunken 3-D charades and soul-baring.
As time passed, the group’s closeness spilled over the edges of VR. Regulars congregated in other online spaces, from a Rec Room–devoted subreddit to a dedicated area of the chat platform Discord; many of them followed one another on Instagram using Rec Room–­specific accounts, some of which show only avatars, never the shy, real people behind them. “A lot of the people in VR have a similar social anxiety,” Priscilla says. “I think that’s why we connect so well.”
One of the people Priscilla connected with was Mark, a comparatively self-assured member of their little group. He’d been self-employed for the past eight years, running a collection of search-based websites. When his mother retired recently, he helped her relocate to a small town outside Seattle. The place was great for seniors, but it wasn’t so stimulating for a thirtysomething who worked from home. Cue Rec Room. “This is pretty much my outlet,” he says, “unless I want to drive two and a half hours to Seattle and then two and a half hours back just to go to a club.” Plus, it was good exercise: Two or three hours a day ducking and jumping in VR paintball beats getting on the rowing machine.
On weekend nights, they’d all hang out, drink, play games, and tell embarrassing stories about themselves—“like you’re 10 years younger than you actually are,” Mark jokes. Priscilla, as it happens, actually was 10 years younger than Mark, 27 to his 37. He was easygoing, with enough gravitas to counterbalance his silliness, and she was drawn to the combination. Priscilla developed a crush on Mark, and he on her, but they never discussed it.
Instead, Mark ended up taking some time away from Rec Room. And Priscilla connected with someone else.
Ben Krieg, a 24-year-old from Ohio, was a lot like Priscilla. The last time he’d had a real social circle was in high school. In college, he was a commuter student, driving 30 or 40 minutes each way to get to his classes, which made cultivating a social life next to impossible. Even later, when he started working, he mostly kept to himself.
After he got an HTC Vive headset for Christmas, Rec Room changed all that. Ben fell in with Priscilla’s group and the two of them became fast friends—texting throughout the day, hanging out in VR at night. Then one day last May, he became the first person in the little group of Rec Room friends to break through the virtual wall; Priscilla invited him down to visit her in Alabama, a seven-hour drive. “I figured, hey, I can do that for a friend,” he says. The visit was charged, and at one point the two kissed. But that, they both ultimately decided, was as far as the romance would go.

You may now ""kiss"" the bride—even if outside the headset, you're just leaning into empty air.
Rec Room's ""maker pen"" allows users to draw persistent virtual objects—like this bridal bouquet, which Priscilla carried to the ceremony.

Here come the paintball guns!
What's a good party without a barrage of paintballs interrupting the revelry?
After the summer ended, Mark started spending more time in Rec Room, and his and Priscilla’s conversations took on a different tenor. They recognized themselves in each other; they talked about their difficulties connecting with people, their tendencies to feel self-conscious. Finally, in October, they decided to meet, and Mark flew to Alabama.
Just in case, he brought an engagement ring with him. That was a Tuesday; by Wednesday, they were engaged; two days after that, they got legally married in a (physical) gazebo on a hill outside Birmingham, just them and the officiant. Then they broke the news to their Rec Room friends. The next week, they said, Mark would head back to Washington to pack up his house so he could move in with Priscilla. While he was there, they wanted to hold another ceremony in Rec Room with all their friends, to be followed by a big, drunken reception. A real wedding, in other words.
“Now,” the officiant says, “Mark and Priscilla have some vows that they would like to recite. Mark?”
“Priscilla Olivia Wadsworth,” Mark begins, “from this day forward I promise to give you all of my love and never let you feel alone in life again ...” Priscilla sniffles loudly.
The vows are done, the imaginary rings exchanged. The happy couple “kisses,” leaning toward each other. Fir trees dot the background over their shoulders, the pink haze of early dusk tinging the sky.
“How do I clean tears from my headset?” a man asks no one in particular.
“We’ve got some music to play,” the officiant says. “Blitz?”
Off to the side, an avatar turns toward the officiant. “Now?” he asks. Then that avatar slumps forward as, back in Ohio, Ben Krieg—Blitzkrieg is his handle—takes off his headset and cues the music: Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration.” The happy couple heads down the path back to the concrete, and everyone follows in kind.

Down the hill from the gazebo, the reception is in full swing. Priscilla and Mark manage to get both their hands on a virtual knife and pull it down through their three-tiered pink wedding cake—which promptly disappears, blinking out into the binary ether.
Someone produces a virtual microphone and it’s passed around so people can give speeches; Rec Room’s audio effects give their voices a slight staticky hiss, as though they’re speaking through a real PA system. “We call it a game,” MrElmo says of Rec Room, “but this—this isn’t a game. This is real. This is something else. I don’t even know. This is … well, this is love! This is marriage! And I just think that’s amazing.”
“I’m like a borderline mentally ill hermit,” a guest says, “so coming out for this has absolutely been incredible. I dunno, as far as I’m concerned you kinda set history, so congrats.”
Then it’s Priscilla’s turn. She takes the microphone in one hand. “I know this isn’t ‘real life,’ ” she begins, her other disembodied hand unconsciously making air quotes, “but I’ve never had so many true friends. I know that seems silly, because it’s a fucking VR game with these silly little cute avatars, but I love each and every one of you.”
Before long, it’s time for the couple’s first dance. Ben the DJ cues up a track by Late Night Alumni called “Meant to Be.”
“This is the song I told you about,” Priscilla says to Mark, their avatars gazing at each other. “Remember? The one I used to cry to while drawing, when I thought I would never find the one?”
“I remember,” he says.
Then two dozen people pelt them with paintballs, green splatters covering the couple as they dance—both of them in their own headsets in Washington and Alabama, standing and swaying in front of their computers, 2,600 miles apart.

On Thursday, Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, gave a speech laying out a new national strategy for artificial intelligence in his country. The French government will spend €1.5 billion ($1.85 billion) over five years to support research in the field, encourage startups, and collect data that can be used, and shared, by engineers. The goal is to start catching up to the US and China and to make sure the smartest minds in AI—hello Yann LeCun—choose Paris over Palo Alto.
Directly after his talk, he gave an exclusive and extensive interview, entirely in English, to WIRED Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Thompson about the topic and why he has come to care so passionately about it.
Nicholas Thompson: First off, thank you for letting me speak with you. It was refreshing to see a national leader talk about an issue like this in such depth and complexity. To get started, let me ask you an easy one. You and your team spoke to hundreds of people while preparing for this. What was the example of how AI works that struck you the most and that made you think, ‘Ok, this is going to be really, really important’?
Emmanuel Macron:  Probably in healthcare—where you have this personalized and preventive medicine and treatment. We had some innovations that I saw several times in medicine to predict, via better analysis, the diseases you may have in the future and prevent them or better treat you. A few years ago, I went to CES. I was very impressed by some of these companies. I had with me some French companies, but I discovered US, Israeli and other companies operating in the same field. Innovation that artificial intelligence brings into healthcare systems can totally change things: with new ways to treat people, to prevent various diseases, and a way—not to replace the doctors—but to reduce the potential risk.
The second field is probably mobility: we have some great French companies and also a lot of US companies performing in this sector. Autonomous driving impresses me a lot. I think these two sectors, I would say, healthcare and mobility, really struck me as promising. It’s impossible when you are looking at these companies, not to say, Wow, something is changing drastically and what you thought was for the next decade, is in fact now. There is a huge acceleration.
NT: It seems you’re doing this partly because it is clearly in France’s national interest to be strong in AI. But it also seemed in the speech that you feel like there are French or European values that can help shape the development of AI? Is that correct, and what are those values?
EM: I think artificial intelligence will disrupt all the different business models and it’s the next disruption to come. So I want to be part of it. Otherwise I will just be subjected to this disruption without creating jobs in this country. So that’s where we are. And there is a huge acceleration and as always the winner takes all in this field. So that’s why my first objective in terms of education, training, research, and the creation of startups is to streamline a lot of things, to have the adaptable systems, the adapted financing, the adapted regulations, in order to build champions here and to attract the existing champions.
But you’re right at the same time: AI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy and our collective preferences. For instance, if you take healthcare: you can totally transform medical care making it much more predictive and personalized if you get access to a lot of data. We will open our data in France. I made this decision and announced it this afternoon. But the day you start dealing with privacy issues, the day you open this data and unveil personal information, you open a Pandora’s Box, with potential use cases that will not be increasing the common good and improving the way to treat you. In particular, it’s creating a potential for all the players to select you. This can be a very profitable business model: this data can be used to better treat people, it can be used to monitor patients, but it can also be sold to an insurer that will have intelligence on you and your medical risks, and could get a lot of money out of this information. The day we start to make such business out of this data is when a huge opportunity becomes a huge risk. It could totally dismantle our national cohesion and the way we live together. This leads me to the conclusion that this huge technological revolution is in fact a political revolution.
When you look at artificial intelligence today, the two leaders are the US and China. In the US, it is entirely driven by the private sector, large corporations, and some startups dealing with them. All the choices they will make are private choices that deal with collective values. That’s exactly the problem you have with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica or autonomous driving. On the other side,  Chinese players collect a lot of data driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours. And Europe has not exactly the same collective preferences as US or China. If we want to defend our way to deal with privacy, our collective preference for individual freedom versus technological progress, integrity of human beings and human DNA, if you want to manage your own choice of society, your choice of civilization, you have to be able to be an acting part of this AI revolution . That’s the condition of having a say in designing and defining the rules of AI. That is one of the main reasons why I want to be part of this revolution and even to be one of its leaders. I want to frame the discussion at a global scale.
AI will raise a lot of issues in ethics, in politics, it will question our democracy.
The key driver should not only be technological progress, but human progress. This is a huge issue. I do believe that Europe is a place where we are able to assert collective preferences and articulate them with universal values. I mean, Europe is the place where the DNA of democracy was shaped, and therefore I think Europe has to get to grips with what could become a big challenge for democracies.
NT: So the stakes here in your mind aren’t just French economic growth, it’s the whole value system that will be incorporated into this transformative technology the world over. And you want to make sure that the values you have, your country has, your continent has, are involved in that?
EM: Sure, exactly. I want to create an advantage for my country in artificial intelligence, directly. And that’s why we have these announcements made by Facebook, Google, Samsung, IBM, DeepMind, Fujitsu who choose Paris to create AI labs and research centers: this is very important to me. Second, I want my country to be part of the revolution that AI will trigger in mobility, energy, defense, finance, healthcare and so on. Because it will create value as well. Third, I want AI to be totally federalized. Why? Because AI is about disruption and dealing with impacts of disruption. For instance, this kind of disruption can destroy a lot of jobs in some sectors and create a need to retrain people. But AI could also be one of the solutions to better train these people and help them to find new jobs, which is good for my country, and very important.
I want my country to be the place where this new perspective on AI is built, on the basis of interdisciplinarity: this means crossing maths, social sciences, technology, and philosophy. That’s absolutely critical. Because at one point in time, if you don’t frame these innovations from the start, a worst-case scenario will force you to deal with this debate down the line. I think privacy has been a hidden debate for a long time in the US. Now, it emerged because of the Facebook issue. Security was also a hidden debate of autonomous driving. Now, because we’ve had this issue with Uber, it rises to the surface. So if you don't want to block innovation, it is better to frame it by design within ethical and philosophical boundaries. And I think we are very well equipped to do it, on top of developing the business in my country.
But I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy. For instance, we are using artificial intelligence to organize the access to universities for our students That puts a lot of responsibility on an algorithm. A lot of people see it as a black box, they don't understand how the student selection process happens. But the day they start to understand that this relies on an algorithm, this algorithm has a specific responsibility. If you want, precisely, to structure this debate, you have to create the conditions of fairness of the algorithm and of its full transparency. I have to be confident for my people that there is no bias, at least no unfair bias, in this algorithm. I have to be able to tell French citizens, “OK, I encouraged this innovation because it will allow you to get access to new services, it will improve your lives—that’s a good innovation to you.” I have to guarantee there is no bias in terms of gender, age, or other individual characteristics, except if this is the one I decided on behalf of them or in front of them.  This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. If you don’t deal with it from the very beginning, if you don’t consider it is as important as developing innovation, you will miss something and at a point in time, it will block everything. Because people will eventually reject this innovation.
NT: So the steps you’re taking to guarantee that is that all of the algorithms developed by the French government will be open, algorithms developed by any company getting money from the French government will also be required to be open?
EM: Yes.
NT: And is there a third step you’re doing to help guarantee this transparency?
I think as well that AI could totally jeopardize democracy.
EM: We will increase the collective pressure to make these algorithms transparent. We will open data from government, publicly funded projects, and we will open access from this project and we will favor, incentivize the private players to make it totally public and transparent. Obviously some of them will say, there is a commercial value in my algorithm, I don't want to make it transparent. But I think we need a fair discussion between service providers and consumers, who are also citizens and will say: “I have to better understand your algorithm and be sure that this is trustworthy.” The power of consumption society is so strong that it gets people to accept to provide a lot of personal information in order to get access to services largely driven by artificial intelligence on their apps, laptops and so on. But at some point, as citizens, people will say, “I want to be sure that all of this personal data  is not used against me, but used ethically, and that everything is monitored. I want to understand what is behind this algorithm that plays a role in my life.” And I’m sure that a lot of startups or labs or initiatives which will emerge in the future, will reach out to their customers and say “I allow you to better understand the algorithm we use and the bias or non-bias.” I’m quite sure that’s one of the next waves coming in AI. I think it will increase the pressure on private players. These new apps or sites will be able to tell people: “OK! You can go to this company or this app because we cross-check everything for you. It’s safe,"" or on the contrary: “If you go to this website or this app or this research model, it’s not OK, I have no guarantee, I was not able to check or access the right information about the algorithm”.
NT: When you talk about how AI will transform democracy, do you imagine a day where you make decisions based on recommendations from AI-based algorithms, where there’s a system that tells you what a labor reform should be and you say, “OK?”
EM: At this point, I think it could help you. But it will never replace the way you decide. When you make a decision, it’s the result of a series of cross-checks. AI can help you because sometimes when you pass a reform, you’re not totally clear about the potential effects, direct or indirect, and you can have hesitations. So it can help you to make the right decision. An algorithm is relevant for this part of the equation. For instance, on economic and social reforms, to have a clearer view about direct and indirect measurable effects. But on top of it, when you take a political decision, you need to have a part of personal judgment. That’s the quality of the decision maker, and artificial intelligence will never replace that. And there is a thing that AI could never replace; which is accountability and responsibility. Because this is his decision and will be held accountable for it, a political leader could never say, “OK I’m sorry this decision was bad because it was a decision of an algorithm.”
NT: Let’s get back to disruption for a second. You’ve talked a lot about transportation, you talked about it in your speech. AI is going to massively disrupt transportation, and it’s going to make a lot of people lose their jobs as we go to driverless cars. It will create new jobs, but this is already an area where people in France have been protesting. There were railroad strikes this weekend, there were trucker strikes this fall. Aren’t you taking a huge risk by aligning yourself with a force that is going to disrupt an industry that has already been protesting like crazy?
EM: Look, I think in this country—and in a lot of countries—you have a tradition of controversy. I launched a series of reforms that a lot of people thought impossible to be conducted in France. So, I'm absolutely sure it's possible, when you explain to people, when you have the energy and determination, to pass such reforms. I’m certainly not reluctant to do so and I’m certainly not, I would say, upset or threatened by dealing with artificial intelligence and convincing my people of its rightful implementation. As consumers, they are already big fans of artificial intelligence. And big fans of innovative solutions. All the tech guys can tell you that the French market is a very good market. People love technology here. I think that’s why the overall philosophy I have stuck to from the very beginning of my mandate is to say: blocking changes and being focused on protecting jobs is not the right answer. It’s the people you need to protect. You do so by giving them opportunities and by training and retraining them again to get new jobs. Don’t block the change because it’s coming and people will accept it. But try to be at the fore-front of change to better understand it and deal with it. Change can destroy jobs in the very short run, but create new ones in other sectors at the same time.
For me, one of the key issues of artificial intelligence is that it will probably reduce the most replicable and straining human activities. And naturally you will raise a whole range of other opportunities for people with low, middle and high qualifications. The big risk for our society is to increase opportunities only for very highly qualified people and, in a way, very low-qualified workers. It is especially necessary to monitor the qualification of the middle class, because they can be the most disrupted. If I take your examples, that would encompass taxi drivers, people working in the industry, or people working in highly repetitive tasks. So you have to train them either to change their sector of activity or to increase their qualification to work with a machine. We will need people working with machines.
For I do not believe that autonomous vehicles will exist without any drivers at all. For me, that’s pure imagination. You already have fully automated programs to drive planes. Therefore we technically could have planes with no pilots. But you still have two pilots in every plane. Even if almost everything is automated. That’s because you need to have responsibility, precisely. So what we will reduce with autonomous cars is the number of risks. What you will reduce is how painful it is to be a driver for a long period of time ; but you will need people to make the critical choice at critical moments for autonomous vehicles. I’m almost sure about that. So AI will change the practice but it will not kill transportation jobs in many cases.
Bottom line, my point is: I can convince my country about change precisely because I embrace it. My role is not to block this change, but to be able to train or retrain people for them to get opportunities in this new world.
NT: Got it. I want to ask you  a military question. I know that the UN has had discussions on restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons. Do you think machines—artificial intelligence machines—can ever be trusted to make decisions to kill without human intervention?
EM: I’m dead against that. Because I think you always need responsibility and assertion of responsibility. And technically speaking, you can have in some situations, some automation which will be possible. But automation or machines put in a situation precisely to do that would create an absence of responsibility. Which, for me, is a critical issue. So that’s absolutely impossible. That’s why you always need a human check. And in certain ways, a human gateway. At a point of time, the machine can prepare everything, can reduce uncertainties, can reduce until nil the uncertainties and that’s an improvement which is impossible without it, but at a point of time, the go or no-go decision should be a human decision because you need somebody to be responsible for it.
Blocking changes is not the right answer. You have to protect people and to think about opportunities.
NT: Let me ask you about the national competition in artificial intelligence. Elon Musk tweeted some months ago: “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of World War3 in my opinion.” Do you think Musk is overstating it? Or do you think that this is going to get very intense, particularly between the United States and China?
EM: I think it will become very intense. I will not be so pessimistic, because I think that the core basis of artificial intelligence is research. And research is global. And I think this artificial intelligence deals with cooperation and competition, permanently. So you need an open world and a lot of cooperation if you want to be competitive. And at a point of time, in some issues, you need competition. But I think you will have to rethink a sort of sovereignty. I addressed that in my speech today. Artificial intelligence is a global innovation scheme in which you have private big players and one government with a lot of data—China. My goal is to recreate a European sovereignty in AI, as I told you at the beginning of this discussion, especially on regulation. You will have sovereignty battles to regulate, with countries trying to defend their collective choices.  You will have a trade and innovation fight precisely as you have in different sectors. But I don't believe that it will go to the extreme extents Elon Musk talks about, because I think if you want to progress, there is a huge advantage in an open innovation model.
NT: So this is a slightly cynical response to that, but let me ask you this: If France starts to build up an AI sector, in some ways it’s competitive to Google and Facebook. So won’t there be an incentive for Europe and for France to regulate Facebook and Google in ever-tougher ways? Doesn’t it create a strange dynamic where you might have incentives to bring more regulation and antitrust?
EM: Look, I would say exactly the opposite. Today, Google, Facebook, and so on, on artificial intelligence, they are very much welcome. Most people like them, these companies invest in France, they also recruit a lot of our talents and they develop their jobs here. So they are part of our ecosystem. The issue for these big players is the fact that they will have to deal with several issues. First, they have a very classical issue in a monopoly situation; they are huge players. At a point of time–but I think it will be a US problem, not a European problem–at a point of time, your government, your people, may say, “Wake up. They are too big.” Not just too big to fail, but too big to be governed. Which is brand new. So at this point, you may choose to dismantle. That’s what happened at the very beginning of the oil sector when you had these big giants. That’s a competition issue.
But second, I have a territorial issue due to the fact that they are totally digital players. They disrupt traditional economic sectors. In some ways, this might be fine because they can also provide new solutions. But we have to retrain our people. These companies will not pay for that; the government will. Today the GAFA [an acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon] don’t pay all the taxes they should in Europe. So they don’t contribute to dealing with negative externalities they create. And they ask the sectors they disrupt to pay, because these guys, the old sectors pay VAT, corporate taxes and so on. That’s not sustainable.
Third, people should remain sovereign when it comes to pivacy rules. France and Europe have their preferences in this regard. I want to protect privacy in this way or in that way. You don't have the same rule in the US. And speaking about US players, how can I guarantee French people that US players will respect our regulation? So at a point of time, they will have to create actual legal bodies and incorporate it in Europe, being submitted to these rules. Which means in terms of processing information, organizing themselves, and so on, they will need, indeed, a much more European or national organization. Which in turn means that we will have to redesign themselves for a much more fragmented world. And that’s for sure because accountability and democracy happen at national or regional level but not at a global scale. If I don’t walk down this path, I cannot protect French citizens and guarantee their rights. If I don't do that, I cannot guarantee French companies they are fairly treated. Because today, when I speak about GAFA, they are very much welcome I want them to be part of my ecosystem, but they don’t play on the same level-playing field as the other players in the digital or traditional economy. And I cannot in the long run guarantee my citizens that their collective preferences or my rules can be totally implemented by these players because you don't have the same regulation on the US side. All I know is that if I don’t, at a point of time, have this discussion and regulate them, I put myself in a situation not to be sovereign anymore.
NT: But aren’t those two goals very much in tension? You want the GAFA to come to France, you’ve touted it—Google has been invested in AI [in France] since 2012—but you also really want to crack down on them. How do you do both simultaneously?
EM: No. Look, because I think first, you don’t just have the GAFA. You have a lot of other players, startups, and so on. And I think, even for them, I mean they are discovering they will have to deal with democratic and political issues in your country.
NT: They’re just starting to learn that!
EM: Yes, yes! I mean, it’s fair. That’s the end of the very first phase, that was a sort of an early phase without any regulation, where they were in a situation to set up all the rules. Now they will have to deal with governments — but I want to do it in a cooperative way. I don't want to say, “I don’t want this guy anymore.” Exactly the opposite. I want a permanent dialogue. But I want them to understand and respect my constraints. I want them to be part of my reflection and to take into consideration their own reflection. I want them to better understand the fact that it is unfeasible to have a world without any responsibility and without a clear democratic accountability.
NT: Got it. So back to the big question, what will be success? How will you know that this has worked? And what will be failure? When you look at this a couple years from now?
EM: Look, first of all I think it’s very hard to answer this question because by definition, I don't have a clear view on what will happen for artificial intelligence in five years time. But I would say, if I manage to develop a very strong, powerful ecosystem, number one in Europe on artificial intelligence dealing with mobility, defense, healthcare, fintech, etc. I think it will be a success. And for me, if a majority of people in France understand and endorse this change it will be a success. It will be a failure if we are stuck with fears and blocked by big scares. My concern is that there is a disconnect between the speediness of innovation and some practices, and the time for digestion for a lot of people in our democracies. I have to build a sort of reciprocal or mutual trust coming from researchers, private players, startups, and my citizens. If the first category of people trust a country as being a relevant ecosystem for them, and at the same time, if I manage to build trust with my citizens for AI, I’m done. If I fail building trust with one of them, that’s a failure.

Well, that's just great.
We've all seen the Terminator movies, and the apocalyptic nightmare that the self-aware AI system, Skynet, wrought upon humanity.
And behaviour tests conducted on Google's DeepMind AI system make it clear just how careful we need to be when building the robots of the future.
In tests in 2016, Google's DeepMind AI system demonstrated an ability to learn independently from its own memory, and beat the world's best Go players at their own game.
Then it started figuring out how to seamlessly mimic a human voice.
More recently in 2017, researchers tested its willingness to cooperate with others, and revealed that when DeepMind feels like it's about to lose, it opts for ""highly aggressive"" strategies to ensure that it comes out on top.
The Google team ran 40 million turns of a simple 'fruit gathering' computer game that asks two DeepMind 'agents' to compete against each other to gather as many virtual apples as they could.
They found that things went smoothly so long as there were enough apples to go around, but as soon as the apples began to dwindle, the two agents turned aggressive, using laser beams to knock each other out of the game to steal all the apples.
You can watch the Gathering game in the video below, with the DeepMind agents in blue and red, the virtual apples in green, and the laser beams in yellow: 

Now those are some trigger-happy fruit-gatherers.
Interestingly, if an agent successfully 'tags' its opponent with a laser beam, no extra reward is given. It simply knocks the opponent out of the game for a set period, which allows the successful agent to collect more apples.
If the agents left the laser beams unused, they could theoretically end up with equal shares of apples, which is what the 'less intelligent' iterations of DeepMind opted to do.
It was only when the Google team tested more and more complex forms of DeepMind that sabotage, greed, and aggression set in. 
As Rhett Jones reported for Gizmodo back in 2017, when the researchers used smaller DeepMind networks as the agents, there was a greater likelihood for peaceful co-existence.
But when they used larger, more complex networks as the agents, the AI was far more willing to sabotage its opponent early to get the lion's share of virtual apples.
The researchers suggest that the more intelligent the agent, the more able it was to learn from its environment, allowing it to use some highly aggressive tactics to come out on top.
""This model ... shows that some aspects of human-like behaviour emerge as a product of the environment and learning,"" one of the team, Joel Z Leibo, told Matt Burgess at Wired.
""Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant environments with less possibility for costly action. The greed motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all the apples oneself.""
DeepMind was then tasked with playing a second video game, called Wolfpack. This time, there were three AI agents - two of them played as wolves, and one as the prey.
Unlike Gathering, this game actively encouraged co-operation, because if both wolves were near the prey when it was captured, they both received a reward - regardless of which one actually took it down:

""The idea is that the prey is dangerous - a lone wolf can overcome it, but is at risk of losing the carcass to scavengers,"" the team explains in their paper.
""However, when the two wolves capture the prey together, they can better protect the carcass from scavengers, and hence receive a higher reward.""
So just as the DeepMind agents learned from Gathering that aggression and selfishness netted them the most favourable result in that particular environment, they learned from Wolfpack that co-operation can also be the key to greater individual success in certain situations.
And while these are just simple little computer games, the message is clear - put different AI systems in charge of competing interests in real-life situations, and it could be an all-out war if their objectives are not balanced against the overall goal of benefitting us humans above all else.
Think traffic lights trying to slow things down, and driverless cars trying to find the fastest route - both need to take each other's objectives into account to achieve the safest and most efficient result for society.
It's still early days for DeepMind, and the team at Google, but the initial results show that, just because we build them, it doesn't mean robots and AI systems will automatically have our interests at heart.
Instead, we need to build that helpful nature into our machines, and anticipate any 'loopholes' that could see them reach for the laser beams.
As the founders of OpenAI, Elon Musk's research initiative dedicated to the ethics of artificial intelligence, said back in 2015:
""AI systems today have impressive but narrow capabilities. It seems that we'll keep whittling away at their constraints, and in the extreme case, they will reach human performance on virtually every intellectual task.
It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly.""

We're not surprised (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
An alarming study that claimed the gene-editing technique CRISPR could produce hundreds of unexpected mutations in edited genomes has now been followed up by its authors, who say they cannot replicate their controversial result.
The acknowledgment – which comes in a report of new mice experiments that didn't introduce such mutations – isn't technically a retraction of their earlier findings, but it goes a long way to showing that the alarm bells should probably never have been sounded in the first place.
In the new research, the team conducted whole-genome sequencing on two mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure.
In their original study, they performed the same analysis – and it was the first time whole-genome sequencing had ever been run on a living organism subjected to CRISPR gene-editing.
But unlike the original results, in the new experiments, no unintended gene variants showed up after the genetic alterations.
This contrasts starkly with the team's first study, in which they found that the two CRISPR-edited mice had sustained over 1,500 single-nucleotide mutations, along with more than 100 larger deletions and insertions that weren't intended.
These variations showed up in 'off-target' portions of the animals' genomes, suggesting that while CRISPR editing could alter genetic code to fix certain abnormalities, it could also introduce unwanted mutations elsewhere in the genome.
""We feel it's critical that the scientific community consider the potential hazards of all off-target mutations caused by CRISPR,"" one of the team, cell biologist Stephen Tsang from Columbia University said at the time.
That's a valid concern to have, and it's something we certainly should be on the lookout for.
But the problems other scientists had with these alarming findings weren't with the team's 'big picture' approach, but with shortcomings in their method.
Soon after publication, a critique of the original paper by another team pointed out that the two gene-edited mice in the experiment were genetically more closely related to each other than to the third, 'control' mice.
The implication was that the 'unexpected mutations' Tsang's team had detected weren't the result of CRISPR, but simply due to the pre-existing genetics of the mice selected for the study.
And since their sample of animals in the experiment was so small, the results weren't just unreliable, they were misleading – especially since the researchers were vocal about how this kind of analysis hadn't been done before, implying it revealed dangerous shortcomings about CRISPR.
Due to the level of controversy and concern over the original study, the editors of Nature Methods – the journal in which the paper was published – formally stated they were concerned about the veracity of the findings, given an ""alternative proposed interpretation is that the observed changes are due to normal genetic variation"".
While Tsang's team did not share those concerns, they nonetheless cared enough to revisit the matter in their new research, and their Corrigendum (correction) analysis is a vindication for CRISPR, acknowledging the 'unexpected mutations' hypothesis was, as far as we call tell, a mistake and nothing more.
While defending their ""reasonable concern"" about such unintended mutations, the authors nonetheless conclude the new results ""support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations"".
All this is a good thing. It's the scientific method at work, revising our interpretation based on new information, and while some are arguing the original paper should finally be retracted, that hasn't happened yet.
Many are probably still angry the original paper was published at all. But for now at least, new data have come to light, and there are still important things we have learned from this research.
The preliminary findings are available at the pre-print site bioRxiv.

Take control of your information.
Facebook is back in the hot seat over revelations that data on millions of its users was taken and used by a company working for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Brexit vote.
Specifically, a company called Cambridge Analytica (CA) took data from a reported 50 million Facebook users and built personality profiles in order to serve people with political ads to ""target their inner demons,"" according to Christopher Wylie, the former CA employee who blew the whistle on the situation, as reported by The Observer and The New York Times.
Facebook last week banned CA from its platform and announced it planned to audit the company to verify if the Facebook data had truly been deleted, as CA had promised it had been years ago. There's now a tornado of investigations being launched over the matter in the US and the UK.
All of this raises the question: How could Facebook know your ""inner demons""?
The truth is that Facebook knows a scary amount of stuff on you. Its whole business relies on watching what you do on Facebook, as well as tracking what you do on the internet via social media plug-ins (like the ability to ""Like"" a news post on a third-party website) and tracking the apps you install on your phone.
Here's how to find out exactly what Facebook knows about you
To find out what Facebook knows about you, log in to Facebook and head to a page called ""Your ad preferences"".
You can find the page through this URL https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences. Or by clicking on the small arrow on the top right of the blue bar and then clicking ""settings"" and then ""ads.""
(Facebook/Business Insider)
Facebook keeps track of anything you ""Like"" as you use its service. I apparently liked some page with an emotional message and now Facebook believes I will respond to ""emotion.""
(Facebook/Business Insider)
Facebook also tracks what you do on the internet.
Plus, every time you use Facebook to log in to apps on your phone it tracks that information. That's how Facebook learned I use Fandango on my phone.
(Facebook/Business Insider)
If you're not brand new to Facebook, there are likely pages and pages of data on you.
(Facebook/Business Insider)
After scanning all this stuff you do online, Facebook builds a profile about you, which you can see by clicking on ""your categories."" This is info Facebook shares with advertisers.
(Facebook/Business Insider)
For me, it determined things about my family life, where I live, and what kind of tech I use. There is a lot of information about me that Facebook keeps track of and then uses to allow advertisers to target ads to people like me who share similar interests.
(Facebook/Business Insider)
Not all of it is accurate. Facebook has labelled me as ""very liberal"" which is funny and a bit unsettling. My political views are moderate.
You have the ability to cross out anything on the page, but it's not clear what impact that would have on ads, particularly political ads or fake news that target you, based on data that was previously gathered on you.
(Facebook/Business Insider)
Facebook also tracks your location, meaning where you are and where you've been, using both Facebook and Instagram.
(Facebook/Business Insider)
You can tell Facebook not to share your information with some advertisers, but the only way to have Facebook NOT track any of your activities is to stop using its services, including the other apps it owns like Instagram.
It's important to remember that Facebook is free because it makes its money by showing you ads.

100,000 Lego bricks.
The stratospheric rise of Bitcoin over the last decade has left the world struggling to keep up, breaking records, spawning rivals, and forcing us to face the epic challenges posed by a volatile crypto-universe.
Now, one LA-based artist is having his say on our obsession with cryptocurrencies, and he's putting his money where his mouth is – embedding thousands of dollars' worth of Bitcoin in his artworks, which are actually visual representations of his cryptocurrency wallet codes.
In other words, these colourful mosaics aren't just something you can hang on your wall: they're basically encrypted passwords hiding in plain sight, and if you can figure out how to crack the code, you could unlock an estimated US$10,000 worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin Initially Valued at $80, 2,304 LEGO pieces on dibond and wood, 15 x 15 inches, 2017 #andybauch
A post shared by  Andy Bauch (@andybauch) on Jan 12, 2018 at 8:59am PST
""I am attempting to help those without computer science backgrounds visualise and understand the rather abstract concept of cryptocurrencies and simultaneous democratising the potential and volatility that comes along with them,"" artist Andy Bauch explains.
Using LEGO bricks as his medium, Bauch's newest show – New Money – was exhibited last week at ​Castelli Art Space in Los Angeles, comprising some 100,000 bricks that elaborately reveal (if you're persistent) the secret keys to his wallets for various Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Cannabiscoin investments.
In a nod to the rapidly shifting value of these cryptocurrencies, the title of each work is a reference to Bauch's original sum invested: Bitcoin initially valued at $20, $50, $90, and so on.
Those sums might not sound like that much, but the incredible ascent in Bitcoin's fortunes since Bauch dabbled in cryptocurrencies means the current financial value of each artwork – aside from its artistic value, of course – is worth way more now (provided you're handy with ciphers, that is).

To figure out how to pictorially display his crypto-keys in LEGO brick form, Bauch used a ""combination of human and algorithmic input"", and as an enticement to any art investors, he says he'll provide a clue to any investors who purchase his art, to give them a helping hand in cracking the code.
Not that such assistance is actually required, with New Money's exhibition listing pointing out that anyone can basically ""steal the cryptocurrency from the art"" by decoding the patterns for themselves.
To ensure the artworks were decipherable, Bauch tested each via reverse extrapolation, confirming that anyone who figures out each wallet code will be able to claim its contents.

As amazing as it all sounds, it's not the first time somebody has done something like this, but it might be the first time an artist is doing it while having such a pointed say on the negative effects things like AI are doing to our culture, and specifically, our workforce.
In a related work, called COG, from a series called Museum of Human Obsolescence, Bauch depicts a Best Buy employee slowly fading away into nothingness.
Hidden inside the LEGO bricks, another Bitcoin wallet code is stashed, somewhere. Its original value: $13.07, a reference to the average retail wage.

The problem doesn't stop here.
The data on millions of Facebook users that a firm wrongfully swiped from the social network probably has spread to other groups, databases and the dark Web, experts said, making Facebook's pledge to safeguard its users' privacy hard to enforce.
Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the company will notify users whose data may have been taken by Cambridge Analytica, a political marketing firm that worked for the Trump campaign.
Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of an estimated 50 million users in 2014 and 2015 under false pretenses, breaking Facebook's rules. Zuckerberg said that Facebook, the world's biggest social network, has taken steps to ensure that data on millions of its users does not get into the wrong hands.
But Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a privacy expert and co-founder of PersonalData.IO, said he suspects the data has already proliferated far beyond Cambridge's reach.
""It is the whole nature of this ecosystem,"" Dehaye said. ""This data travels. And once it has spread, there is no way to get it back."" 
Zuckerberg said Facebook will investigate and audit thousands of third-party developers. Third-party apps could access data on Facebook users and their friends until 2015, when Facebook changed its rules.
Experts question whether the network's push to investigate and audit thousands of third-party developers will merit any true results. Dehaye questioned how Facebook would define which apps merit investigation and what would constitute ""suspicious activity"".
Facebook said that it conducts manual and automated checks to make sure that developers are complying with its policies. It also plans to expand its bug bounty program to report misuse of data.
Zuckerberg said in interviews Wednesday that the company is investigating reports that independent researchers and dark-web data brokers are trading user data grabbed by the firm Cambridge Analytica. 
Frank Pasquale, a professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in algorithms and tech ethics, called this ""the runaway data problem,"" and said there is no way to return the genie to the bottle when it comes to securing data that has been released.
Location and demographic information, which was taken from Facebook, can often be used to tie someone to other data points where the identity was previously unclear.
""The larger [the] data sets you get about individuals, the easier it is to use those to reidentify them in data sets where they think they're anonymous,"" Pasquale said.
""With a relatively small amount of data points, you can infer an incredible amount of very personal information about people.""
Facebook does not know whether other companies have shared or mishandled user data, and a forensic audit is ongoing, Zuckerberg told Wired magazine.
Asked by Wired how confident he was that Facebook data had not gotten into the hands of Russian operatives or other groups, Zuckerberg said, ""I can't really say that. I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit.""
For many of Facebook's prime growth years, the company gave outside developers access to virtually everything that a user who authorized an app, or her friends, had posted on the social network: her home town, current city, events and location check-ins; her interests, groups and all the pages she'd liked; her relationship statuses with romantic partners, friends and family; her birthday, activities, work history and political and religious affiliations; and her photos, notes and videos.
Facebook changed its rules in 2015 amid concerns over how the data was being used. But for years, other developers had the power to construct the same kinds of massive microtargeted databases that had helped make Facebook so prominent.
It's unclear how many other services used that power or what they have done with the data pulled.
Zuckerberg said the company will ""investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information"" before the rule change, a number he said is probably in the thousands.
The company, he added, ""will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity"" and probably will need to hire more workers to complete the audits. ""We want to make sure that there aren't other Cambridge Analyticas out there,"" he told Wired.
The data shared with Cambridge Analytica was taken via a personality quiz, called ""ThisIsYourDigitalLife"", that was initially approved by Facebook for research purposes.
It's unclear how Facebook would know how to find or recover users' data. The data taken by the researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who provided it to Cambridge Analytica, ""wasn't watermarked in any way,"" Zuckerberg told Wired.
""And if he passed along data to Cambridge Analytica that was some kind of derivative data based on personality scores or something, we wouldn't have known that, or ever seen that data.""
In the same year that Facebook severed ties with him, Kogan also started his own San Francisco-based survey data firm, Philometrics, raising questions about whether he took the Facebook data with him and used it for commercial purposes. (Kogan did not reply to repeated requests for comment.)
Apps and start-ups that grabbed user data over a number of years, Dehaye said, often hand over their data if they're acquired by another company or sell their data if they close or liquidate.
Facebook opened the door to developers in 2007 in hopes of expanding its reach across the Web by making it easier for other sites to connect with the sprawling connective maps the network uses to link people by relationships and tastes, known as its ""social graph"" and ""interest graph.""
Marketing firms have spent tens of millions of dollars to learn similar information - including compiling consumer surveys and purchasing massive consumer files from data brokers such as Experian and Acxiom - all of which came from different sources and had varying ages, precision and usefulness.
Facebook's wealth of data, on the other hand, was packed with detailed information volunteered by users themselves and offered completely free until the rule change took effect in 2015.
Facebook, Zuckerberg said, will now restrict the data that third-party developers can access to names, profile photos and email addresses, and will require developers to sign a contract before being allowed to ask users for rights to their posts.
Facebook said it will ban developers who misuse its data.
The sheer size of the data pulled from Facebook, experts say, is powerful on its own - and could prove valuable for marketers, political campaigns or other groups seeking to target users en masse.
""Getting good data on 50 million people from a relatively neutral, nonpartisan source that is diversely spread, and not just clustered in one tiny segment of the social graph - that's a big deal,"" said Matthew Hindman, a George Washington University associate professor who researches online campaigning and Internet politics.
""If you can see that many people's activity on Facebook, you can guess pretty accurately what their partisanship might be, no matter how good your model is.""

There is a video 😱😱😱
For the US Department of Defense (DoD), killing people isn't all that complicated. A budget of more than US$600 billion per year buys a whole lot of tanks, guns, and bombs.
But not killing someone proves to be a bit more complicated. How about just stunning them a bit from far away? Or maybe setting their clothes on fire without having to look them in the face?
For that, we've got the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Development Program (JNLWD).
The program's purpose: to develop weapons and other devices military personnel can use to incapacitate targets without outright killing them.
As explained on the program's FAQ, the goal of the JNLWD is to fill the gap between ""shout and shoot"" (truly, we should all be grateful the armed forces acknowledge that such a gap exists).
The JNLWD's latest breakthrough is the Non-Lethal Laser-Induced Plasma Effect (NL-LIPE) system. They recently gave Defense One a look at the in-development device. And it's truly a sight to behold.
Rather, a sound to behold. Take a listen below (and maybe make sure your pets are out of the room because, we promise, they really hate this).

Here's how this device is useful.
Imagine an enemy is getting a bit too close for comfort, and you want them to back off.
You could use a stun grenade, a blinding flash of light and noise that leaves the enemy disoriented and stunned. Those only work if you're close enough to throw them, though.
And maybe you have some good guys standing in between. How do you blast the enemy but not the good guys? That's where the lasers come in.
First, the NL-LIPE operator shoots a burst of light at the target using a femtosecond laser. This rips electrons from the air molecules to create a ball of plasma at the targeted site.
The operator then manipulates the plasma ball using a second nanolaser, directing the plasma to produce sound or light, or even burn clothing.

Right now, of course, the technology is still in development, so it only works under pretty specific conditions.
Eventually, though, the military thinks it could get the device to work at distances of tens of kilometers, David Law, head of JNLWD's technology division, told Defense One.
That would give it a longer range than any other non-lethal weapon.
Law also said the researchers believe they're very close to getting their device to outright ""speak"" to them, but the creepy almost-voice it already produces would likely be enough to get any enemies to turn tail.

There's something hidden inside it.
The Bitcoin world is coming to grips with a shocking revelation that could potentially threaten the very existence of the world's foremost cryptocurrency.
An analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain – the publicly accessible ledger of transactions upon which the system is built – has revealed this vast trove of data is irrevocably tainted with unremovable links to illegal child pornography, which are inevitably distributed among and by all users of the currency.
The discovery of this – in addition to other questionable and possibly outlawed content stored within the blockchain – hypothetically makes Bitcoin ownership illegal in almost every country that has laws against the possession and distribution of images of child abuse.
That's the view of a team led by researchers from Germany's RWTH Aachen University, who sifted through the blockchain to examine how much ""arbitrary data"" it contained.
While the open ledger is primarily intended to store financial information related to Bitcoin transactions, non-financial information can also be inserted into the blockchain by users on the system – and to drastic effect.
In their analysis, the researchers uncovered more than 1,600 inserted files on the blockchain, over 99 percent of which are texts or images, including links to child pornography, copyright violations, privacy violations and more.
The data capacity of each 'block' on the Bitcoin blockchain itself is a very slim 80 bytes. That's not enough for actual images to be housed, but plenty for web links or other code pointers and references.
""Our analysis shows that certain content, eg. illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal,"" the team writes in its paper.
""Since all blockchain data is downloaded and persistently stored by users, they are liable for any objectionable content added to the blockchain by others. Consequently, it would be illegal to participate in a blockchain-based [system] as soon as it contains illegal content.""
The potential ramifications of that statement can't be emphasised enough. If the researchers' contention is correct, the problems here aren't limited to just Bitcoin.
Potentially any cryptocurrency or other technological system based around a user-manipulable (and permanent) blockchain could be susceptible to the same illegality – although this is very new territory legally speaking, which lawyers, judges, and legislators will have to address.
Right now, though, despite the controversial novelty of the researchers' discovery, it looks like there's a pretty arguable case that Bitcoin possession does in fact break the law.
As the researchers point out, 112 countries have ratified an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child that makes possession of child pornography illegal – and the team's preliminary analysis of statute law in the US, England, Germany, and Ireland suggests Bitcoin ownership could already be a legal violation in those countries.
In other quarters, some argue that mere links to illegal content should not be conflated with illegal content itself. That's one point of view, but given the seriousness with which lawmakers treat child pornography, it's not like Bitcoin doesn't have a serious issue here.
In any case, it will be up to courts and legislators to determine how to regulate Bitcoin and the problematic contents of its blockchain, now that the topic is facing much greater publicity.
Interpol actually identified this threat of illegal or dangerous (ie. malware) content being embedded in blockchain systems back in 2015.
In their analysis, the researchers didn't find any malware, but they did turn up evidence of all sorts of random information interspersed in Bitcoin's public record.
This includes wedding photos, emails, chat logs, cryptographic keys, and WikiLeaks data – in addition to a copy of the famous original Bitcoin paper, whose anonymous author has never been formally identified.
We wonder, did the mysterious creator of Bitcoin ever imagine the paradoxical complexity of this loaded Trojan Horse they were setting loose upon the world?
We'll probably never know the answer, but we doubt we've heard the last of this.
The findings were presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2018 conference in Curaçao in February.

A good time to clean up your data.
Facebook is currently facing a scandal over the use of its data by British political research company Cambridge Analytica.
The company reportedly obtained the personal information of 50 million Facebook users.
It didn't get the data through a hack, but reportedly through a Facebook app which gave a researcher user data – and also the data of their friends.
Most people forget that when they download an app or sign into a website with Facebook, they are giving those companies a look into their Facebook profile. Your profile can often include your email address and phone number as well as your work history and current location.
And most people don't realise that if you're sharing that data with friends, then apps used by those friends can see that data as well!
Advertisers, Facebook-app developers, and Facebook ad-tech partners can't see your name, your phone number, or your employer – Facebook encrypts and anonymizes all the data to protect your privacy. But it does sell that data in bulk to companies who want to target and track both you and people like you.
1. To start off, go to the arrow symbol on the far right of your Facebook page.
(Facebook)
2. We're going to be taking a deep dive into the settings.
(Facebook)
3. Once you're in the settings, go to Apps.
(Facebook)
4. This is the shocking bit, the list of company apps that are tracking you on Facebook. Apparently I have allowed 54 apps access to my Facebook account. Be sure to click on the ""show all"" button to get the full list.
(Facebook)
5. Voila! The list of apps tracking me is so long I have to make this zoomed-out view to see them all.
(Facebook)
6. Hover your mouse over one of the apps. You have options. You can edit the app's permissions or delete it completely so it can no longer access your Facebook account.
(Facebook)
7. TripAdvisor knows my email, my age and — oddly — my work history! I love TripAdvisor. But this feels like a reach.
(Facebook)
Review each app to edit its permissions or delete its access to you on Facebook entirely. It's a bit time-consuming – but otherwise you're just giving these people free data.
8. Now scroll down a bit further in the Settings > Apps section. You have more options — we've highlighted the two most important. You can use Facebook to log in and play games anonymously. But we suggest you also click on the ""Apps Others Use"" section.
(Facebook)
9. Inside ""Apps Others Use"" you can see all the data you're letting your friends see, and that data is being seen by the apps your friends use!

The first fatality of an autonomous vehicle.
Uber Technologies Inc. has halted autonomous vehicle tests after one of its cars struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in what is likely the first pedestrian fatality involving the technology.
The 49-year-old woman, Elaine Herzberg, was crossing the road outside of a crosswalk when the Uber vehicle operating in autonomous mode under the supervision of a human safety driver struck her, according to the Tempe Police Department.
After the incident, which happened at 10 pm local time on Sunday, she was transferred to a nearby hospital, where she died from her injuries.
""Uber is assisting and this is still an active investigation,"" Liliana Duran, a Tempe police spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.
Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona. We're thinking of the victim's family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened. https://t.co/cwTCVJjEuz
Our hearts go out to the victim's family. We're fully cooperating with @TempePolice and local authorities as they investigate this incident.
Uber said on Monday that it was pausing tests of all its self-driving vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Toronto and the greater Phoenix area.
""Our hearts go out to the victim's family,"" a company spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.""
Companies including Alphabet Inc., General Motors Co., Uber and Baidu Inc. are investing billions of dollars to develop autonomous-vehicle technology because it has the potential to transform the auto industry, transportation in general and the way cities work.
One analyst has estimated Alphabet's Waymo unit is worth at least $70 billion. The fatality in Tempe could slow testing, delay commercialization and undermine such optimism.
Testing has expanded to complex urban areas as states like Arizona and Texas take a light-touch regulatory approach and companies race to be first to commercialize the technology.
That's helped improved the systems, but also increased the chance of a pedestrian death. Experts have long worried about the impact deadly crashes could have on the nascent industry.
""We're within the phase of autonomous vehicles where we're still learning how good they are. Whenever you release a new technology there's a whole bunch of unanticipated situations,"" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's business school.
""Despite the fact that humans are also prone to error, we have as a society many decades of understanding of those errors.""
The National Transportation Safety Board is opening an investigation into the death and is sending a small team of investigators to Tempe, about 10 miles east of Phoenix.
The Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dispatched a special crash investigation team.
The NTSB opens relatively few highway accident probes each year, but has been closely following incidents involving autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles. Last year, it partially faulted Tesla Inc.'s Autopilot system for a fatal crash in Florida in 2016.
The NTSB's cautionary tone on the emergence of self-driving technology contrasted with the Department of Transportation, which revised its policy on self-driving vehicles last year in an attempt to remove obstacles to the testing of such vehicles.
""As always we want the facts, but based on what is being reported this is exactly what we have been concerned about and what could happen if you test self-driving vehicles on city streets,"" said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group.
""It will set consumer confidence in the technology back years if not decades. We need to slow down.""
The Phoenix area is a fertile ground for experiments in the technology. Uber has been testing there with safety drivers behind the wheel.
Late last year, Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo, which has tested in the Phoenix area for years, began removing the safety drivers to transport a small number of residents. (Waymo staff sit in the back seat.)
General Motors Co. is also testing in the Phoenix area. A GM spokesman declined to comment, and a representative from Waymo didn't return multiple requests for comment.
""Public safety is our top priority, and we are in communication with law enforcement, which is investigating the accident and gathering facts, as well as Uber,"" a spokesman for Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said.
Uber has had incidents in the past. Last year, Uber suspended its self-driving car program after one of its autonomous vehicles was involved in a high-impact crash in Tempe.
The Uber vehicle was not responsible for the incident, and there were no injuries, the police said at the time.
""Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer,"" Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell said in a statement on Monday.
""Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe Police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.""

If only we knew exactly what that was.
Do you have free will? Can you make your own decisions? Or are you more like an automaton, just moving as required by your constituent parts?
Probably, like most people, you feel you have something called free will. Your decisions are not predetermined; you could do otherwise.
Yet scientists can tell you that you are made up of atoms and molecules and that they are governed by the laws of physics. Fundamentally, then – in terms of atoms and molecules – we can predict the future for any given starting point.
This seems to leave no room for free will, alternative actions or decisions.
Confused? You have every right to be. This has been one of the long outstanding unresolved problems in philosophy.
There has been no convincing resolution, though speculation has included a key role for quantum theory, which describes the uncertainty of nature at the smallest scales.
It is this that has fascinated me. My research interests include the foundations of quantum theory. So could free will be thought of as a macroscopic quantum phenomenon? I set out to explore the question.
Quantum free will
There is enough philosophy literature on the subject to fill a small library. As a trained scientist I approached the problem by asking: what is the evidence?
Sadly, in some ways, my research showed no link between free will and fundamental physics. Decades of philosophical debate as to whether free will could be a quantum phenomenon has been chasing an unfounded myth.
Imagine you are on stage, facing two envelopes. You are told that one has £100 inside and the other is empty. You have a free choice to pick one – yet every time the magician wins, and you pick the empty one.
This implies that our sense of free will is not quite as reliable as we think it is – or at least that it's subject to manipulation, if it is there.
This is just one of a wide variety of examples that question our awareness of our own decision making processes. Evidence from psychology, sociology and even neuroscience all give the same message that we are unaware of how we make decisions.
And our own introspection is unreliable as evidence of how our mental processes function.
So, what is the evidence for the abstract concept of free will? None. How could we test for it? We can't. How could we recognise it? We can't.
The supposed connection between our perception of free will and the uncertainty inherent to quantum theory is, therefore, unsupported by the evidence.
But we do have an experience of free will, and this experience is a fact. So having debunked the supposed link with fundamental physics, I wanted to go further and explore why we have a perception of being able to do otherwise.
That perception is nothing to do with knowing the exact position of every molecule in our bodies, but everything to do with how we question and challenge our decision making in a way that really does change our behaviour.
Artificial free will
For me as a scientist, this meant building a model of free will and testing it. But how would you do this? Could I mimic it with a computer program? If I were successful how would my computer or robot be tested?
The topic is fuelled with prejudice. You would probably assume without evidence that my brother has free will, but my computer does not.
So I will offer an emotionally neutral challenge: if an alien lands on Earth, how would you decide if it was an alien being with free will like us, or a sophisticated automaton?
Strangely, the philosophical literature does not seem to consider tests for free will. But as a scientist, it was essential to have a test for my model.
So here is my answer: if you are right handed, you will write your name holding a pen in your right hand. You will do so predictably almost 100 percent of the time. But you have free will, you could do otherwise.
You can prove it by responding to a challenge or even challenging yourself. Given a challenge you may well write with your left hand. That is a highly discerning test of free will.
And you can probably think of others, not just finely balanced 50:50 choices, but really rare events that show your independence and distinguish you from an automaton.
Based on this, I would test my alien with a challenge to do something unusual and useless, perhaps slightly harmful even, like putting its hand near a flame. I would take that as evidence of free will. After all, no robot would be programmed to do that.
A computer with free will?
And so I tried to model that behaviour in the simplest most direct way, starting with a generic goal seeking computer program that responds to inputs from the environment.
These programs are commonly used across disciplines from sociology, economics and AI. The goal seeking program is so general that it applies to simple models of human behaviour, but also to hardware like the battery saving program in your mobile phone.
For free will, we add one more goal: to assert independence. The computer program is then designed to satisfy this goal or desire by responding to challenges to do otherwise.
It's as simple as that. Test it out yourself, the challenges can be external or you can generate your own. After all, isn't that how you conclude that you have free will?
In principle the program can be implemented in today's computers. It would have to be sophisticated enough to recognise a challenge and even more so to generate its own challenges.
But this is well within reach of current technology. That said, I'm not sure that I want my own personal computer exercising free will though …

Machine learning requires massive amounts of data to teach the model. But we're often uploading that data to machine learning cloud services run by folks like Amazon and Google, where it might be exposed to malicious actors. Can we use machine-learning-as-service and protect privacy?

Machine learning is one of the hottest disciplines in computer science today. So hot, in fact, that cloud providers are doing a good and rapidly growing business in machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS). 
But these services come with a caveat: all the training data must be revealed to the service operator. Even if the service operator does not intentionally access the data, someone with nefarious motives may. Or their may be legal reasons to preserve privacy, such as with health data. 
In a recent paper, Chiron: Privacy-preserving Machine Learning as a Service Tyler Hunt, of the University of Texas, and others, presents a system that preserves privacy while enabling the use of cloud MLaaS. 
  While users may not wish to reveal their training data, the service providers have privacy concerns of their own. They typically do not allow customers to see the algorithms under their MLaaS technology. 
To that end, 
Chiron uses Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) secure enclaves, an architecture designed to increase the security of application code. But SGX alone isn't enough. Chiron also uses the SGX platform for Ryoan sandbox, a distributed, protected sandbox that secures untrusted user code from malicious infrastructure, such as you might find in the cloud. 
Chiron's goal is to protect the user's training data, as well as trained model queries and outputs, while in the cloud. To that end:
Since trained models can leak training data through certain queries, Chiron ensures that only the entity that supplied the training data can query the resulting model. Even an attacker with complete control of the infrastructure could not query the model to access training data. 
Seems comprehensive enough, but there are issues with the underlying hardware.
SGX itself is not bulletproof. In particular, Intel's Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU), enables an untrusted platform to peer deeply into what the system is doing.
Since Chiron relies on Intel's SGX, it can't be used with GPUs, since these lack an SGX-like facility. So the current implementation is far from ideal until the GPU vendors also start taking security seriously.
Despite the limitations, Hunt et. al. tested Chiron and found that its performance was competitive with standard, unprotected, infrastructures.
The little Dutch boy had it easy: he could plug a hole in the dike with one finger. In our modern, massive data world, there are millions of holes, exploitable in thousands of ways. 
Perfect security doesn't seem likely, but we can certainly do better than we have been; right, Facebook? If we can make it harder, we'll knock out the cyber street criminals - muggers - and leave the field to big, well-financed players, against which we can field big, well-financed, tools, such as Chiron. 
Hold on to your hats. Big Data is taking us on a wild ride.

Intel's latest barebones living room desktop ships with the company's Core i7 G series of processors, which integrate its rival's Radeon RX Vega M graphics to provide a VR-ready experience in a unit that can easily slip into a backpack.

Intel Hades Canyon NUC
It's a classic case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend: While Intel and AMD are rivals when it comes to processors, they both have a common target in Nvidia when it comes to computer graphics. Though Intel has made strides in improving the integrated graphics for its Core CPUs, they still can't really cut it when it comes to serious computer gaming and other video-intensive applications.
As a result, the company announced a partnership with AMD at this year's CES to add a custom Radeon RX Vega M GPU to select mobile versions of its eighth-generation Core i5 and i7 processors. AMD has long set its sights on toppling Intel from its CPU perch, but when it comes to discrete graphic, it's competing with Nvidia for the crown. One reason AMD may have been willing to do this deal is that its share of the laptop processor market is much lower than in desktops, where its Ryzen chips have made a splash since their debut last year. 
While the first notebooks featuring the Core G series are just starting to roll out, the product sporting the new components that is garnering the most attention is actually a desktop. Also teased at CES, Intel's souped-up mini-PC dubbed the Hades Canyon NUC will be taking advantage of the graphics power, which is difficult to squeeze into the type of tiny system the NUC (short for Next Unit of Computing) represents.
The Hades Canyon NUC is getting closer to being released, as evidenced by the number of reviews that have been published online in the past couple of days. The consensus: Despite its diminutive form factor, it packs more power than many of its mini-PC competition, fully capable of running virtual reality applications that it was designed for.
Mini-PCs often have a difficult choice to make -- rely on integrated graphics to stay svelte, or forego a bit of the ""mini"" to make room for a graphics card of some kind. The Hades Canyon NUC may be the mini-PC that avoids such compromises, as it may be smaller than your cable box while packing the equivalent graphics power of Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q (per our sister site CNET's review).  
If that sounds too good to be true, that's because there are a  couple of caveats. First is the price. At around $800 for the Core i7-8705G version and $1,000 for the edition with overclockable i7-8809G, it's costlier than most other mini-PCs, which is especially true given another factor to consider. The Hades Canyon NUC is being sold as a bare-bones unit, with consumers forced to provide RAM, solid-state storage, and operating to complete a fully functional system. While that is an additional cost to be factored in, gamers might welcome the opportunity to purchase the components they want rather than be limited to pre-built configurations.
Reviewers agree you won't achieve the type of performance from the Hades Canyon NUC that you would from a full-fledged gaming desktop with a top-end discrete graphics card. Then again, you might not want to display such a tower next to the HDTV in your living room. Plus you get a glowing skull on a computer that weighs just 2 pounds and can easily be moved around in a backpack with your VR glasses. Is that worth the price tag for you?

Infor is a company on the fast track, though you wouldn't know that. It is among the most design-focused, progressive companies in the technology world, and it has an offering that can go to head-to-head with anyone's out there. Yet, it is a best-kept secret. I'm now going to show and tell. Read on -- Infor is now in the sunlight.

                        Beyond the wow factor: Why customer experience management is not about exceeding expectations
                    

Thomas Wieberneit takes on customer experience management and the differences between delighting the customer all the time (not) and making sure things work for that customer (yes).

For several years in the 2010s, I was an adviser to Infor's CRM organization -- a sterling bunch of CRM leaders who loved the space and, at the same time, had some top-flight CRM-related applications (chief among them, Epiphany, one of the greatest customer-facing products of all time).
Read also: Conversations are precisely what we need to think about
I'd venture to say that Epiphany was the founding father of all RTIM and related technologies and remained the ne plus ultra of the interaction universe for a long time. More on that later. But even more foresighted and, to a large extent, more interesting, in 2012, Infor did something that I found (and still find) one of the single most innovative and incredibly valuable things I've ever seen in the tech industry: It created a for-internal-use-only design organization called Hook&Loop. What made this a fascinating and immensely valuable idea (and a true differentiator) was that the hires weren't coders or architects but creatives -- 100 of them -- including the chief designer of Michael Kors and the person responsible for the special effects in the early Transformer movies -- you know, when the special effects (and the movies) were really good.
Hook&Loop, headed by one of my favorite Infor management team members, Chief Digital Officer Marc Scibelli, was and remains a breakthrough for a software company, especially one that is focused on enterprise software. What makes it unique is that it is responsible for design. But not just design of user interfaces and a user experience that is unparalleled in the enterprise software world, but also for building design, marketing collateral design, and design support for the customers of Infor. It becomes not only a creative design agency for Infor, but a trusted adviser to Infor's customers. But, this year, Infor and Hook&Loop added another capability to its portfolio: Development. That means not only is it designing the interfaces, but it is developing the applications natively, which makes the user experience and the user interfaces themselves much better, due to the effectiveness and efficiency of the applications, if done right.
The net effect of Hook&Loop is that Infor has consistently had the most beautiful interfaces of any technology on the market. I would venture to say that it set the standard for that beauty, with companies like SAP and others following Infor's lead to ""efficiently prettify"" its UIs and user experience.
But, of course, Infor isn't a creative design agency. It's an enterprise software company and, after having attended its analyst summit a couple of weeks ago, a damned interesting one. And it's surprisingly more advanced, though with some caveats, than I had expected after this three-year hiatus.
One of the reasons that I was shocked was that, since I stopped being its adviser on CRM, I had seen the company do some things that I thought were not that wise, though I understood them. To be blunt, Infor was an ERP company and its back office was the money maker, and thus, what it focused on for that reason. CRM, despite a very good portfolio of products at the time, wasn't given the time, the attention, or the budget it deserved at Infor, and it slowly but surely started fading from my radar and, as far as I could tell in my conversations, most of the CRM analysts' -- many of who really had no relationship to the company.
I would see a press release now and then, and I'd think, ""Hmmm, nice. But it isn't investing in CRM, so I don't hold a lot of hope out for it even having CRM products in a couple of years."" Well, I wasn't really thinking that literally, but in that spirit. That would be an awkward literal thought. Its CRM(ish) efforts seemed to be turning ghostly. It didn't appear in too many deals that I was hearing about, and the competitive reports (MQ) would mention it peripherally at best, though favorably on occasion. For example, Marketing Resource Management, one of its strengths, got it a leadership position in the 2016 Gartner MRM Magic Quadrant. Nucleus Research, led by the inestimably intelligent Rebecca Wettemann, gave its CRM solution a leadership position as recently as November of last year due to its investments in multiple cutting-edge capabilities, though some that extend well beyond the CX portfolio (e.g. the acquisition of Birst last year).
Here's a quote from Rebecca:
I'm probably less aware than Rebecca is about what Infor was up to concerning CRM, but, Hook&Loop remained, and that always intrigued me and kept me at least thinking about Infor. That said, I'm definitely curious, so when I was invited to the Infor Analyst Summit in New York City this year, I decided to go and see what it was up to with CRM. One of the major reasons was that personalization, design, and journey orchestration were all part and parcel of the customer engagement world that was beginning to show some real form. Hook & Loop's charter fit the mandate that a technology vendor (and pretty much anyone else in at least the enterprise world) needed to be able to supersede traditional CRM limits -- which had become the must-have technology to enable customer-facing business operations.
The world was shifting to require some focus on the right-brained concepts of engagement, interaction, behaviors, etc. Personalization, humanizing the workplace, consumerization of IT, etc, was requiring companies to pay more and more attention to how they were going to create not only the means to interact/communicate with their customers, but provide those customers with what the customers were asking for -- within the limits of budget, time, regulation, and labor, among the many constraints in place. That, when you're an enterprise and scaling up in those areas, was hard to do. Technology was necessary to support scale when it came to all those things. Infor was well positioned for that -- better, in fact, than some of the more visible technology vendors, because Hook & Loop and products, like Interaction Advisor, were all focused around how customers felt and thought, not what operations and processes had to be in place. I can't say that it was fully cognizant of this; I'm saying it, not it, at least not in these terms. I haven't heard it say it. But I'm sure at one level or another it was aware of it, and I know from the Summit that it definitely is now.
Well, I was blown away by some of what I saw. I'm still unclear about some of what I saw (and didn't see), and I'm appalled about one thing that I saw (or, actually, didn't see, but I should have seen).

Let me start this with the most succinct possible statement, via a tweet I put out at the Summit (I thought, for you Hamilton fans, me among them, I'd also include a tweet that came up, which you'll see immediately to my left):
Before I get into the meat of this, I'm going to start with the event: the Analyst Summit. My only complaint is that far too few CRM analysts were there. Basically, there were only two people who cover CRM a good deal -- with no one but me and Sheryl Kingstone from The 451 Group (though I'm only 90 percent certain I'm right about that) who make customer-facing technology our primary coverage. And that was out of what must have been 60 analysts. I think, given what I've seen, and with the new CRM leadership, which is led by the very enthusiastic, nice, and very experienced Dann Lemerand, vice president of product strategy and design at CX, there needs to be a concerted effort to bring CRM analysts into its fold. its lack of outreach is part of the overall issue it has, but more on that later.
The event itself was really well crafted with a mix of executives, product leads, and customers providing the information that we needed, and it truly didn't waste any time at all. It flowed extremely well, with my friend and Infor senior director of analyst relations Sharon Sulc keeping the event on time and flowing properly, and the overall staff made sure that little to nothing went wrong. And, in fact, that most things went right. An ""A"" for that work. Infor team, thank you so much for all your efforts. Even little things were taken care of: For example, I was thinking of skipping the party the first night, or going for a short time at least, so I could visit with a friend of mine, Scott Jeffer, who runs CRM for the Yankees. I told them that and they invited Scott to come hang at the party, and a great time was had by all -- though it surfaced far too many Red Sox fans for my taste. LOL! Little things that leave a really good impression and make experiences like this are memorable. Smart thinking on its part, though I think it was more act of kindness than a calculated move.
The other event-notable thing, and this was truly something, is that CEO Charles Phillips spent the entire two days at the event -- and I would imagine he had a lot to do. I've never seen this from the CEO of a major company in all the decades I've been in this business. Usually, if the CEO comes at all, he or she answers 30 (maybe 45) minutes of questions and leaves, with the only reminder of its presence being a footprint in the dust. They're in and out as fast as they can go -- understandably. Some have a ton of work to do. Many don't particularly love analysts -- they just tolerate us. Charles Phillips spent both days -- minus one or two things he had to attend to -- there the entire time, and he made himself easily available to whoever wanted to talk. It was much appreciated by all the analysts -- and it was noticed and noted by all of us.
It has me thinking that Infor, if it addressed its problem sufficiently -- and it's a big one -- it could compete with the Big 4 and win as often, though I still have enough questions to keep me somewhat uncomfortable with this hypothesis, and questions remain in the areas that I specialize in, but more on that later.
So, let's get on with the content that the tweet was referring to:
Hook&Loop's design ethos permeates the company. It designed a beautiful office in the heart of Manhattan. It designed the software and is developing the apps needed to affect the designs it is both working on and using. It doesn't only do this with its own people but with its customers.

For example, Turtle & Hughes, an electrical and industrial distribution company, around since 1923, (which somehow wangled the URL www.turtle.com from the world's naturalists), uses Infor Distribution, but its approach was what really attracted me to it and attracts me to Infor. It fully recognize that, even in the world of manufacturing and distribution, it has to change with the business climate and alter its activities and its behaviors so that it is aligned with the requirements and demands of a very new breed of customers who are looking at its overall experience with the company almost as much or as much as what products and services the company provides -- and that experience includes how the employees respond to the company, too. So, what a Turtle & Hughes customer told us was that human-centered design and personalization was key to its overall transformative efforts: ""No matter what, we have to deal with that.""
What makes this so interesting and conflicts me somewhat, too, is that, on the one hand, Infor is at the leading edge of design thinking and engagement, and this permeates its entire enterprise product and services set. Yet, I'm still somewhat unclear on its overall thinking on where it want to take the CX portfolio. That said, I am encouraged by Dann Lemerand's leadership as the jefe of the portfolio, because from my interactions with him at the Summit, I can say, pretty safely, I think that Infor finally has a leader in the customer-facing part of its efforts that can do what needs to be done to make it part of the front and center, rather than the rear, and... wherever. At least, what I can tell initially, the best since George Wright was there. So, that is encouraging, because he gets it. He just does. Again, more on this later.
But what there is no doubt of is the deep immersion that Infor has in design thinking. For those of you who don't know what the hell I'm talking about, I'm going to provide you with a short definition of design thinking.
Design Thinking... the future is now
Design thinking for years seemed to be either an academic endeavor or only in the purview of the creative agencies. The resulting effect in the software and technology world was that the companies provided a lot of efficiencies with the use of the software it produced, but it was ugly and hard to use.

The best definition of design thinking I've found is this one:
He's also defined it in a slightly different way, which adds color to the definition he gave above:
George Washington Carver, the great scientist and inventor, had a quote that, while it predates design thinking, obviously, shows you its value in a (pea)nutshell (pun intended):
That's wonderful stuff, but what makes design thinking even more compelling is that the results are actually measurable and dramatic when design thinking becomes part of the corporate culture, strategy, R&D, and output.
Forrester Research and Adobe did a study in 2016 that looked at design-led companies (Coca-Cola being a great example of this type of effort) and those that weren't, and it found that design-led companies had:
But the results are even more impressive over the long term. In a study in 2016 done by the Design Management Institute, it found that design-led firms outperformed the S&P over a 10-year period (2005 to 2015) by a mind-blowing 211 percent. Yeah, baby, 211 percent.
Design thinking, at least my interpretation, is pretty straightforward. Ultimately, human beings are emotional. They respond to things in ways that trigger a feeling of some kind. It could be, ""Whoa, that's cool"" or ""I hate that"" or ""Damn it, I can't figure this out"" or ""That was easy."" I know that, as you read each one of those, if I asked you to associate the statement with an experience you had, you could -- with little to no thinking. When I ran workshops on customer experience, I would often provide a grid of the empty boxes with labels. The labels said (though it varied at times): ""In love with,"" ""love,"" ""like a lot,"" ""like,"" ""eh,"" ""dislike,"" ""dislike a lot,"" and ""hate."" I gave every member of the group five minutes to fill the empty box with a person or a thing that fit that description to them. In the thousands of people (yes, thousands) who took that test, I never had single one who didn't fill it out completely. What that tells you is we all have a very granular understanding of our own feelings, and we can easily associate the objects and/or subjects of the experiences we've had in life to the specific feeling that each of those labels indicates.
Design-led firms get that. Companies that do the design well are not just developing highly navigable user interfaces or developing what is a great user experience, nor is it just designing the consumable, monetizable experiences that benefit its bottom lines. It is deliberately being positively, and if done well, evocative. Unlike so many damned pundits out there who are stupidly promoting customer delight as the non-stop necessity for businesses, the truly successful design-led companies thT are executing well are evoking, say, anything from a ""wow"" to ""comfort."" If I feel that this thing I'm doing is getting done easily and quickly because the design is simple and clean, then the sheer convenience of the frictionless activity and result makes me content, not hyper-excited. What that means is that part of the design mantra is to make the ordinary day to day as easy as possible -- not just evoke some orgasmic sensation every second with customer.
I'm not going to pursue this much more here, because this post is getting really long, and I have some more Infor things to finish, but you, I hope, get the idea. Design thinking takes the beauty, the utility, the effort, the limitations (e.g., the products, area, whatever) it is working with into account when you are thinking through the customer's experience with you as a company. And you are building that into everything you do. The right brain is an integral part of your corporate universe.
OK, primer over. Back to Infor.
Amazed 1.1
To close this section out, Infor's appeal in this realm -- design thinking; Hook & Loop; and its design and development services available to the company and to customers; its overhaul of the UI and UX of all the products including now the CX portfolio and the successful nature of that -- makes it unique in the industry. It can be a remarkable differentiator if it took advantage of the extraordinary range of its offerings including a still more front-and-center approach to CX than it currently has, but, the question is, is it ready and willing to do that? I will attempt to answer that after I get briefly get through ""Astonished.""
Design-led companies need to apply design thinking to something. Infor is among the very few technology companies that has the end-to-end enterprise, front-and-back office capabilities to satisfy the largest companies in the market place with the operational functionality it needs to run a business completely and the services to make it.

Look, I cover the customer-facing space, but I have business experience in the back office (ERP) world, and I keep an interest (though not a keen one) in the space. Minimally, I know what is good and what isn't. Some of Infor's products (the basic back office) competes with anyone's and, of course, the interfaces are much better than most. One or two of its back office products were literally exceptional. One example is its enterprise asset management product (EAM). I don't cover the EAM space per se. I do see it frequently enough, most typically, when it crosses into customer-facing products, such as Adobe Experience Manager, which, at its core, was an asset management tool until a major refresh a year ago turned it into an experience-building solution that had asset management at its back end. Infor's EAM tool is arguably the best I've ever seen -- though the caveat, of course, is that I haven't seen a lot of them. Its customers-lauded Infor Distribution, Infor Retail, and a host of its other back office products... Its analytics seem competitive; Coleman's AI offering seems really promising and sort of at an ""early mature"" stage. All good.
CX Portfolio
Of course, my interest is in its CX suite -- which, as best as I can tell (thank you PJ Jakovljevic -- a good friend and analyst for TEC, for some help in starting to piece this together during the Analyst Summit) is the following:
Read also: Change agents aren't personas, they are human
I was told there was a tenth product, but I am unaware of what that is right now. I'll find out. To make it easier to understand, here is something I pilfered from its website that explains what it offers quite well:
I need to start this with something of a caveat: I had less than one hour to see anything on CRM/CX, and thus, I have a million questions, because, when I dig a little with what's available, I'm just not clear on a few things. And, this is no one's fault; I just didn't have enough time. This is being rectified by Infor.
Caveat No. 1 -- Some core 21st-century CRM functionality seems to not be there. For example, a Service Cloud-like offering. Alhough I see customer service and support, it seems to be more case management-heavy, but it's not aligned with contemporary customer service offerings.
Caveat No. 2 -- Equally as important, I can't understand what the CX narrative is, per se, or how CX as a portfolio fits into the corporate narrative. I didn't hear that at the event (other than random mentions of CRM, really). I see why and how it fits the corporate narrative. It's a natural -- given the visionary thinking and the interest in personalization that Infor customers have overall. But Infor doesn't seem to see it that clearly. Also, as far as the CX overall narrative, I don't have the clarity I need, which provides me with a reason why this is so marketing heavy, with its own marketing capability, Marketo and MRM.
There are a few broadly obvious observations. To repeat, this is heavy on marketing, with three distinct products for marketing: Omni-channel Campaign Management, MDM, which comes to Infor via the 2012 acquisition of Orbis and the integration and go-to-market partnership with Marketo. I have to assume, though, I haven't fully seen it yet. It claims to have core Sales Force Automation capabilities wrapped up in its Infor CRM product, and the value add via the Sales Intelligence product, which would be something in the vein of InsideView and perhaps Lattice Engines, among other players in that market. However, it seems to lack a ""Service Cloud"" at the moment, though it provides its cousin, Field Service, but, then again, a Service Cloud may be the mysterious ""Tenth Product.""
I'll be getting a deep dive into the CX portfolio soon and will be able to report back on what I think will be an exciting part of Infor's offering and one that Infor (finally) is going to invest in to make better. So. here's what I don't know and what I do know:
What I do know -- and like a great deal about the CX offering -- boils down to three things:
But I still have a lot of questions. I am trusting that Infor is willing to invest in the CX portfolio. I think its missing some things, but I can't speak to that until I get a better sense of what actually is there and the value of each product that is germane to it at the moment. Plus, I need a clearer picture of how Infor is incorporating CX into its corporate narrative and what the CX narrative is per se. Once I have that, I can do something a bit more productive.
What I did get a renewed sense of though is that Infor seems to be willing start making the investments in CRM/CX/CE, both from the product side to the personnel to make it part of its end-to-end engagement with customers at the enterprise level -- something that it hasn't done since George Wright left the company.
But, and this is a big but...
Here's where I have a serious problem -- one that I hinted at when I said there wasn't very many CRM(ish) analysts at this event and the same one I made clear in the tweet. Up until now, Infor's marketing efforts -- its attempts at being visible in the customer-facing market (which is much the same as the enterprises it serves on the back end) and in the customer-facing technology industry -- have been just plain awful. 
From my standpoint, how did I not know what I now know? Infor is one of the most innovative companies in the market and carries seriously good looking and highly outcomes-focused products that are industrial strength and end-to-end. How did I not know this, my fellow CRM analysts not know this, the general technology buyers' population for all intents and purpose not know this? Why is it that, with all it offers, no one knows about it? If a tree falls in the forest and no one sees or hears that...?

I can't speak to why that has been the case since I haven't heard much from the company for four years, so treat it as a rhetorical set of questions but at the same time as a serious problem. Because not only does Infor have to fix its marketing, but it also is lagging behind, so there is catch up necessary, too.
Infor is well aware of its lack of market presence. Marc Scibelli, in his Hook & Loop, design, and develop presentation, made the point that, ""Our only problem when we go to a customer is 'Infor who?'"" Charles Phillips, in the Executive Q&A, when speaking of its competitors said, ""The only thing it has is brand and scale, but it is easier to beat them."" (He meant on product quality and design/development support). I think that he made it easier than it really is for spin purposes. It won't be easy to beat any of the Big 4 -- never is.
The good news, at the end of the Summit, with a few of the analysts raising the clarion call of ""Be Out There,"" Charles Phillips introduced Ashley Hart, who was literally starting as its new CMO the following Monday. She is an accomplished CMO. Here's her LinkedIn bio, if you're interested. 
She spoke for a few minutes and made a cogent and very important point -- paraphrased -- we are going to build our corporate narrative and the product messaging will flow from that. Encouraging, very encouraging.
So, being the New Yorker I am and always willing to provide advice whether it's wanted or not, I am going to do just that to Ashley Hart or Charles Phillips or Dann Lenemann or whoever at Infor wants to listen... or not. Again, DNA.
So, let me summarize all this, because there is a lot to chew on, and there are still some uncertainties.

All in all, if I'm looking at the Infor portfolio, it is competitive with anybody, and because of its extraordinary commitment to design thinking and development, it has the chance to win big. It should be the fifth of the Big 4.
But it isn't. The biggest reason for that: It has done a very poor job participating in the industry and has far too little visibility in the marketplaces it address -- especially around the customer-facing aspects of what an enterprise solutions and enterprise platform company needs to be involved with. Up to now, it hasn't marketed well at all; it hasn't been active in the CRM universe in any way, unlike all its other enterprise-grade competitors. That's its biggest issues -- marketing and industry presence.
However, it is a truly brilliant company with a transformative approach to the enterprise built around the charter of Hook & Loop -- being design-led in everything it does and produces internally and externally -- and is more advanced than anyone else in the industry in that regard.
To solve its problem, it hired a new CMO to deal with the very issues that has hobbled them in the last few years -- and her brief conversation with the analysts was very promising.
It still need some clarity, both in the positioning of its CX portfolio in the overall scheme of things, and in the composition of that portfolio and in what its own narrative will be, but its new internal hire to the leadership of CX is confidence inspiring. Ultimately, we'll all find out if that confidence was well placed. I don't think anyone is going to be disappointed.
For me, this is a great re-up with the company, but there is still a lot to learn and a lot that I did learn that I need to process. The uncertainty around the placement of the CX portfolio, in conjunction with the clear commitment of the company to design thinking and the execution thereof, leaves me excited for its future and concerned a little for its ability to deliver it. I'm in the camp that says it will succeed. The caveat is that I'm a glass half-full guy, always. However, this time, it could be justified.

I promised that I would cover my speculations about Oracle and SAP, and to fulfill my obligations for 2017, here they are -- in 2018. The best way to put it is, when it comes to both Oracle and SAP, I'm very cautiously optimistic for very different reasons. But caution rules the day, and these are speculations, not deep analysis. More of that later. For now, read it, and tell me why you weep or laugh or nod.

Created by researchers at Georgia Tech, HoneyBot was inspired by IT security.

A group of researchers at Georgia Tech created a novel tool to delay and potentially expose would-be hackers of industrial automation.
Called the HoneyBot, the small robot is designed to fool perpetrators of cyberattacks into thinking it's a vulnerable robot performing important industrial automation tasks. 
TechRepublic: Defending against cyberwar: How the cybersecurity elite are working to prevent a digital apocalypse
When it detects a successful breach, HoneyBot sounds the alarm and aids IT security professionals in thwarting further attack.
It takes its name from decoy computer systems used in IT security, known as honeypots.
With more industrial robots more connected than ever, the security of robots is of increasing concern. 
As industries as disparate as food service, transportation, and light manufacturing flock to automation, there's growing concern that hackers could get in and disrupt operations, ransom robots -- or worse, cause physical harm to humans.
Last year, a group of ethical hackers turned a friendly humanoid into a murderous killbot. So far there haven't been any big headline breaches with of the type we see nearly everyday in IT security. 
In part, open-source architecture used by a number of robotics developers may be playing an important role, allowing developer communities to root out potential security risks before they're exploited.
But the threats are real, and in the dawning robotic age it's only a matter of time before automation becomes a cyber target.
""A lot of cyberattacks go unanswered or unpunished because there's this level of anonymity afforded to malicious actors on the internet, and it's hard for companies to say who is responsible,"" says Celine Irvene, a Georgia Tech graduate student who worked with the team behind HoneyBot. 


                        Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity
                    

Today's security threats have expanded in scope and seriousness. There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when information security isn't handled properly.

""Honeypots give security professionals the ability to study the attackers, determine what methods they are using, and figure out where they are or potentially even who they are,"" she adds.
In order for a honeypot decoy to work, an attacker has to believe they've accessed an authentic system. In the case of a robot, that means a smart hacker would look for the input data from sensors to verify they have control.
In tests conducted with volunteers, the Georgia Tech researchers successfully fooled a group of volunteers.
The tests were an important affirmation of the effectiveness of the decoy ruse when extended to robotics. 
In practice, a HoneyBot application running on a networked system, one able to simulate real sensor data in the event of an attack, would likely be more practical than a small physical bot.

Machine learning requires massive amounts of data to teach the model. But we're often uploading that data to machine learning cloud services run by folks like Amazon and Google, where it might be exposed to malicious actors. Can we use machine-learning-as-service and protect privacy?

Machine learning is one of the hottest disciplines in computer science today. So hot, in fact, that cloud providers are doing a good and rapidly growing business in machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS). 
But these services come with a caveat: all the training data must be revealed to the service operator. Even if the service operator does not intentionally access the data, someone with nefarious motives may. Or their may be legal reasons to preserve privacy, such as with health data. 
In a recent paper, Chiron: Privacy-preserving Machine Learning as a Service Tyler Hunt, of the University of Texas, and others, presents a system that preserves privacy while enabling the use of cloud MLaaS. 
  While users may not wish to reveal their training data, the service providers have privacy concerns of their own. They typically do not allow customers to see the algorithms under their MLaaS technology. 
To that end, 
Chiron uses Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) secure enclaves, an architecture designed to increase the security of application code. But SGX alone isn't enough. Chiron also uses the SGX platform for Ryoan sandbox, a distributed, protected sandbox that secures untrusted user code from malicious infrastructure, such as you might find in the cloud. 
Chiron's goal is to protect the user's training data, as well as trained model queries and outputs, while in the cloud. To that end:
Since trained models can leak training data through certain queries, Chiron ensures that only the entity that supplied the training data can query the resulting model. Even an attacker with complete control of the infrastructure could not query the model to access training data. 
Seems comprehensive enough, but there are issues with the underlying hardware.
SGX itself is not bulletproof. In particular, Intel's Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU), enables an untrusted platform to peer deeply into what the system is doing.
Since Chiron relies on Intel's SGX, it can't be used with GPUs, since these lack an SGX-like facility. So the current implementation is far from ideal until the GPU vendors also start taking security seriously.
Despite the limitations, Hunt et. al. tested Chiron and found that its performance was competitive with standard, unprotected, infrastructures.
The little Dutch boy had it easy: he could plug a hole in the dike with one finger. In our modern, massive data world, there are millions of holes, exploitable in thousands of ways. 
Perfect security doesn't seem likely, but we can certainly do better than we have been; right, Facebook? If we can make it harder, we'll knock out the cyber street criminals - muggers - and leave the field to big, well-financed players, against which we can field big, well-financed, tools, such as Chiron. 
Hold on to your hats. Big Data is taking us on a wild ride.
Courteous comments welcome, of course.

5G networks are coming, but it will be a few years before they are in widespread use and while increased speeds are part of the story, it is more about capacity and interference. NetMotion has a solution now that can improve the productivity of mobile workers.

                                   By Matthew Miller

 	If you don't want to wait years to see how 5G turns out then you may want to consider the NetMotion Mobility solution that is available now and provides reliable, stable, and secure connectivity. Emergency responders, utilities, and transportation businesses currently use it and the technology has proven to be successful.
 	A few weeks ago I met with several folks from NetMotion who walked me through product offerings that are applicable to mobile workers. It is clear that NetMotion has a vast amount of experience in this area and offers an extremely compelling solution for the enterprise.
 	Christopher Kenessey (CEO), John Knopf (VP of Product), Steve Fallin (Senior Product Manager), and Randy Green spent a couple hours taking me on a deep dive into the inner workings of NetMotion and as an engineer I was thrilled by the information and details presented to me. I am working with the IT department of my engineering firm to test out the NetMotion Mobility VPN solution as my office looks to start providing more support from outside the office.
 	We have all heard about VPN services, just check out David Gewirtz's thorough article from a couple of weeks ago, and understand they are a secure way for businesses to conduct business. Traditional VPN services are designed for static connections. Today's workforce is mobile, which means connections to the internet are made from WiFi hotspots, secure home or office WiFi networks, and cellular networks that often suffer from weak signals as the worker moves. NetMotion Mobility is designed from the ground up to make sure mobile workers can get their jobs done without frustration or lost time.
 	World demand for mobile data has currently exceeded the capacity of all wireless technology and demand is quadrupling while capacity is doubling. NetMotion uses advanced algorithms and programming to intelligently balance connectivity between LTE and WiFi while also providing per application VPN controls. 
The Mobility solution is designed to also provide a high level of security with FIPS 140-2 validated encryption, NSA Suite B cryptography, Common Criteria EAL 4+ certifications in place.
 	IT departments have the capability to perform advanced analytics on the system and optimize applications and connections to make sure critical work is a priority. Data can be blocked or compressed in order to provide the best connection for work.
 	Mobile workers with NetMotion Mobility have the frustration with maintaining connections removed, which leads to high efficiency and the ability to perform outside the workplace just as if that worker was in the workplace. The worker understands that they have an ""always-on"" connection, no matter where they are working, and is able to focus on the work and not trying to maintain the connection.
 	There are some interesting and encouraging case studies posted on the NetMotion website including how AT&T reduced expenses by 43 percent and how the Dutch Pilots' Corporation uses NetMotion Mobility to enable its autonomous navigation system used to manage harbor traffic of about 100,000 ships and more than 700 pilots a year.

Apple iPhone throttling: Class action lawsuit filed in Canada too
Apple is facing a 12.7 billion won ($US11.9 million) class action lawsuit from batterygate in South Korea.
Law firm Hanuri, representing 63,767 consumers, filed a class action lawsuit against Cupertino for damages caused by the company's intentionally slowing down performances of older iPhone models to prolong their battery life.
It is the biggest in terms of plaintiffs for a single lawsuit in South Korea.
Hanuri is demanding 200,000 won, or US$188, per plaintiff for duping consumers and causing mental distress.
Also: Batterygate: Apple betrayed its customers and now it faces a world of hurt
Initially, 400,000 requested to take part in the lawsuit but the number dwindled following authentications.
In January and earlier this month, a local consumer protection NGO filed lawsuits with 122 and 401 plaintiffs, respectively. They demanded around US$2000 per person in damages.
Apple has reportedly been slapped with at least 59 separate lawsuit since December for batterygate.

Apple had quite a week with the announcement of a new entry-level iPad that has Pencil support and the release of iOS 11.3. Combined with continued iPhone X usage, iOS is becoming my platform of choice.

After more than three weeks of use, it has already worn off the shine and my iPhone X is back as the daily driver. Apple announced the new iPad 9.7 and released iOS 11.3 this week and combined with some cellular performance issues I had with the S9 Plus it is clear to me that iOS is the platform for me.
Last year I purchased and used an iPad Pro 10.5 and Apple Pencil for several months before passing it along to my oldest daughter as I moved to the Google Pixelbook. The Pixelbook is my primary home computer, but while it is an engineering marvel, it is not a great tablet.
Every month more engineers in my office move to Apple iPads for meetings and productivity on the go. Despite what many may say, you can indeed get work done on an iPad. I have been considering another iPad Pro 10.5, but at a starting price of $649 I couldn't justify it again. As David Gewirtz pointed out, the Apple Pencil is an important feature on this new entry-level iPad and at a starting price of $329 I just couldn't pass it up so I go pick up my new iPad 9.7 today at Best Buy.
Also: Apple has finally announced the iPad we've always wanted
The Google Pixelbook is a joy to use as a computer with an always-connected keyboard, but it is a bit clunky as a tablet and the stylus support is still a bit limited in Chrome OS and Android. iPad apps are much better than Android tablet apps, both in design and performance.
I am looking forward to having the iPad 9.7 with me in every meeting to take notes, traveling with it on business trips for entertainment and working on an airplane tray table, and even trying out the latest and greatest ARKit applications.
While I will have fun with the new dragon and skull Animojis with my family and friends, I am particularly interested in some other features of iOS 11.3. These include improvements to Apple Health, Apple News, Safari, visual voicemail, and more.
As I continue my half marathon training and raise my awareness of the status of my health, I find the new ability to have my provider health records synced to my iPhone or iPad very compelling. I already have solid access through an electronic charting system, but having this data available right in Apple Health on my iOS devices will help me manage my health, set realistic goals, and measure progress towards improved health and fitness.
I currently typically check out the latest news through Twitter, but also use the News app loaded on iOS devices. Apple improved News in iOS 11.3 by making top stories appear first in the ""for you"" tab. I installed the update this morning and had a better news experience on my commute home from work on the train.
My iPhone X sat in standby mode for the last few weeks while I thoroughly tested the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. Picking it back up just confirmed it truly is one of my all-time favorite phones and the one that currently meets my needs best. It has a perfect form factor for me, I like the full frontal display and notch, and there are services that are proving essential on a daily basis that are starting to lock me into the Apple ecosystem.
For example, Find Friends is outstanding for staying in touch with my daughters while the four of us are all over the place. iMessage is also excellent at communicating with people who also have iPhones in hand.
Also: Is iPhone X worth buying? Here's why so many iPhone owners say no
I have also been seeing some poor performance on the Galaxy S9 Plus with T-Mobile in weak signal areas that I have not seen for years. I can usually count on Samsung beating the iPhone for signal strength and RF performance, but the opposite is happening to me right now. My iPhone X keeps going while the S9 Plus disconnects in the exact same location with both phones sporting T-Mobile SIM cards. I don't know what is going on, but it has happened over a couple of week period and I'm not putting up with it.
I will continue to test Android devices and my Pixelbook will remain my primary computing device, but iOS continues to work its way into my life and it is going to take something very special to knock the iPhone X out of my hand.

Google Cloud's wide-ranging partnership with the NCAA will be on full display this weekend during the Final Four men's basketball tournament. 
Using a predictive analytics architecture and workflow built over the last few months, Google says it will produce and air real-time ads during half time that will attempt to anticipate what will happen in the second half of the Final Four games. 
The end-to-end analytics architecture leverages Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datalab and BigQuery to ingest, load, and analyze observations from the first half of each game, along with decades of historical NCAA data, to make predictions about the second half. Google said the predictions will include things like the number of three-point shots each team might attempt. 
""As halftime starts, the real work begins. We'll have only minutes to turn our prediction into a TV spot,"" Google Cloud team member Courtney Blacker wrote in a blog post. ""Our creative team will take the prediction generated by our team of data scientists and data analysts and create the ad right there in the Alamodome, using a real-time rendering system built by Cloneless and Eleven Inc.""

""This is likely the first time a company has used its own real-time predictive analytics to create ads during a live televised sporting event,"" Blacker said.
Beyond game play predictions, Google's real aim here is to show off the possibilities of predictive analytics and machine learning in an example that's relatable to the general population.
The NCAA partnered with Google Cloud last year and has been migrating 80-plus years worth of game data across 24 sports and 19,000 teams over to Google's architecture. With the NCAA's team and game data on Google's cloud, Google's arsenal of machine learning technology has also been used to improve the tournament selection and team seeding process.

iPhone users are still vulnerable to being tricked into handing over passwords. Apple knows it — but won't do anything about it.

(Image: ZDNet)
iPhone or iPad users, if you update to iOS 11.3 now, you'll have new features and a bunch of security updates. But you'll still be just as vulnerable to on-device phishing attacks as you ever were.
A long-expected privacy icon debuts in the software update out Thursday which help users identify when Apple requests more of their personal information. The update doesn't change how much data Apple collects, but it helps show what data will be collected when Apple apps and features are used for the first time.
""You won't see this icon with every feature since Apple only collects this information when it's needed to enable features, to secure our services, or to personalize your experience,"" a screen says, once you update.
Maybe the timing is a coincidence, but this seems like a way to grab some good headlines amid Facebook's recent data sharing controversy.
Will Strafach, a security researcher with a focus on mobile, knows iOS better than most. He told ZDNet that the privacy icon will have some benefits.
""Although the purpose was misinterpreted as some kind of indicator -- it is not -- the actual purpose of giving information on how data is used is a very good thing I believe,"" he said. ""Many people these days wonder about how their data is used and just have no idea, so if Apple is going to ask for something sensitive, it seems very helpful to give information to the user on data management -- and users can then hold them to it instead of it being ambiguous.""
The downside is that, contrary to several reports, the privacy icon actually has nothing to do with preventing phishing attacks that try to steal your iCloud password. For its part, Apple never confirmed that the privacy icon would do anything of the sort. 
We reached out to Apple, but a spokesperson would not comment on the record.
Although phishing attacks on the desktop have been around for years, they're less so targeted to the individual device. And as widely celebrated for their security as iPhones and iPads are, the device's weakest link is often a result of tricking the average user into turning over their password.

It's a problem that Apple doesn't seem to want to tackle -- despite a rash of attention earlier this year, when Felix Krause demonstrated in a blog post how easy it was to trick an iPhone or iPad user into turning over their Apple ID credentials. 
In a proof-of-concept, he said users are ""trained to just enter"" their email address and password ""whenever iOS prompts you to do so."" Any long-term iPhone or iPad user can tell you that their phone or tablet will randomly prompt for your password, but often it's not clear why. And that's something attackers are keen to capitalize on.
One report called the attack a ""hacker's dream.""
""Showing a dialog that looks just like a system popup is super easy. There is no magic or secret code involved. It's literally the examples provided in the Apple docs, with a custom text,"" said Krause. 
He described it as ""less than 30 lines of code"" that every iOS engineer would know. 
Even with two-factor authentication, users aren't necessarily safe, said Krause. If you wanted to inflict damage, you only need a user's Apple ID email address and password to wipe a person's device without warning.
Apple says in a developer post that it's difficult to combat phishing -- or social engineering as it's often referred to.
Others say it's not that difficult.
""I would like to see the password requests show up as a banner alert or notification sent by the Settings app, which should send the user to the Settings app when pressed in order to enter their credentials,"" said Strafach.
""No icon or anything else is sufficient because the running app is able to mess with all user interface elements including status bar,"" he said. ""Using an alert and redirect to Settings would completely solve the issue."" 
It's a simple solution that Krause -- and others -- have already suggested. But Apple won't budge, and its customers remain at risk.

 	Under Armour revealed on Thursday after the markets closed that its MyFitnessPal app has been hacked.
 	The fitness apparel company learned that data on 150 million accounts for the site and app were breached earlier this week, a statement said.
 	""The investigation indicates that the affected information included usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords -- the majority with the hashing function called bcrypt used to secure passwords,"" said the statement, referring to the use of a stronger password hashing algorithm.

 	The company said payment card data was not affected. Under Armour is currently notifying MyFitnessPal users about the breach via email and in-app messaging, and it's requiring all app users to change their passwords.
 	Later in the day, the California attorney-general released the company's data breach notification, per the state's law -- a mirror statement of what the company posted on its website.
 	Under Armour, thanks to its acquisitions of several fitness app firms -- including MyFitnessPal -- has amassed massive amounts of data on both professional athletes and fitness enthusiasts. The company has even claimed to have the largest database of athlete behavior, including stats on workouts, nutrition, and sleep patterns. Under Armour has said that it uses this trove of data to make its gear smarter.
 	The data has helped Under Armour morph from an apparel maker into an athletic performance and technology company, rivaling Nike for the same target demographic.
 	Under Armour's connected fitness platforms includes UA Record, MapMyFitness, Endomondo, and MyFitnessPal, and all of those platforms have unified to run on Amazon Web Services.

Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang said science needs super-charged computers, so that's why his company is building them.

                                   By Asha McLean

Nvidia is building a supercomputer specifically designed to help with the increasingly computationally complex area that is medical imaging.
 	Unveiled at Nvidia's annual GPU Technology Conference in San Jose this week, Clara -- named after Clara Barton who founded the America Red Cross -- was labelled by Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang as ""a datacentre-virtualised, multimodality, multi-user, medical computational medical instrument"".
Also: Nvidia wants GPUs reserved for those who need it, not those mining ether
 	With around 3 million instruments installed in hospitals throughout the world, and 100,000 new ones installed each year, Huang predicts it will take about 30 years before the installed base is replaced with upgraded equipment.
 	""The question is how do we solve this problem? We can't wait for 30 years for doctors to be able to have this early detection and for doctors to have this technology in their hands,"" he said. ""Because of our technology, it's possible for us to virtually upgrade every single medical instrument.""
 	According to Huang, supercomputing is now a fundamental pillar of science.
 	""We need larger computers; even then we need larger computers; the world needs larger computers, because there's serious work to be done, there's serious ground-breaking work to be done,"" he said.
 	""Science needs super-charged computers and that's the reason why we're building super-charged computers.
""Our strategy at Nvidia is to accelerate GPU computing at the speed of light.""
 	Speaking with ZDNet about the future a machine like Clara promises, Nvidia VP of healthcare and AI business development Kimberly Powell said the GPU giant has been focusing on healthcare for over 10 years, alongside the medical imaging industry, which has been driven by computing for at least as long.
 	""If you think about what medical imaging does, it does computation, it does processing, digitalisation, and artificial intelligence,"" she said.
As Huang detailed, Nvidia started by performing image reconstruction inside instruments and serving up the volume rendering and image processing required for the interpretation of such images.
 	For the past five years, Nvidia has also worked with the research and startup communities exploring the future of AI from a healthcare lens.
 	""We're at a very fortunate time in medical imaging in that all the technology Nvidia has been developing over the past five years, we can now literally virtualise medical imaging pipelines, these medical imaging instruments,"" she explained.
 	""We can take data that may be coming from a 10-year-old machine and apply computation to it remotely and be able to do all of this really innovative computation, essentially bringing the capability to every instrument that's on the planet.
 	""And so that's what Clara is; it's really a platform for doing this medical imaging supercomputing workload.""
 	While Clara is still being built by Nvidia, what the supercomputer will be capable of is no pipedream.
 	At its most basic, Clara is a computing platform that allows the virtualisation of workloads -- a virtualised datacentre for all the computation that happens in medical imaging.
 	""It could be an on-prem resource, it could be on AWS, and it will leverage the technology stack that we've put together over the years,"" Powell continued. ""So of course it has virtualised GPU, it has Nvidia GPU containers, and it containerises applications, and eventually it will make use of Kubernetes on GPUs to efficiently manage these microservices over the resources that are needed.""
 	According to Powell, the dream for Nvidia is to provide Clara to regions where radiologists or specialists, for example, aren't as common, or where the high-level training that is required to become a radiologist isn't as accessible as it is in many Western regions.
 	""One of the ways we think about it is, let's make sure it's everywhere accessible to everyone and as quickly as we can bring these tools and put it into the hands of the people that can use it,"" she said. ""You can spin up a very cheap instance in the cloud to get access to it, you could buy gaming GPUs to get access.""
 	Pointing to AlphaGo, Powell said that upon reflection, in the first three games the computer beat the human -- but in the fourth game, the human beat the computer because he was taught by the computer something he didn't always know how to do.
 	""So it is not an elimination thing, this is an augmentation thing,"" she said. ""I think we all get better by technology and so this technology is giving the ability to see things and they can learn from that and build that into their own internal brain and neural network and experience.
 	""I'm completely speculating, but you could imagine you might become an expert in 10 years' time versus 30 years' time, because you've had the computer be able to point these things out.""
 	Discussing some potential use cases, Powell said she came across a case recently that saw 23,000 unread X-rays in the UK; similarly, she said in Japan there's a very ""disorienting number"" of instruments and medical exams that are performed when placed in a ratio against the number of practicing radiologists.
 	""This, I think, is an opportunity to balance some of that out,"" she said.
Powell said being able to sequence genomes requires a lot of data and computational power to process such data, and that the data is only growing thanks to the increasing cost efficiency of genomics.
 	""And so the pharmaceutical companies, they're all trying to figure out how do we integrate this data and perform some intelligent analysis on top of it to get on that journey to true precision medicine,"" she explained.
 	 ""Now we're reading everything about the body that's happening on a daily basis -- that data integration I think is going to transform the pharmaceutical industry and totally transform the healthcare continuum, because you have a lot more information about a person before they became symptomatic.
 	""It's going to be so powerful and that digitisation ... consolidation where we want to get all that data in one place is going to require a new computing architecture and a new computing paradigm -- a lot of it coming from software.""
 	Powell expects more of Clara to be unveiled at the Radiological Society of North America conference in November.

Connecting the dots: Here are some of the whys and hows around Microsoft's latest reorg -- and especially how it affects Windows and Devices.

Video: Microsoft plans to lure Linux distribution maintainers with new open-source tool
The word is out: Microsoft is embarking on yet another reorg, arguably the biggest since Satya Nadella took over as CEO four years ago. In this one, Windows is going to be cleaved into a couple of parts -- all in the name of making Microsoft over to focus on its high-growth businesses.

Here's what's happening, as Microsoft's top brass announced March 29:
Microsoft is splitting up its Windows and Devices Group and moving the pieces into two new engineering units: Experiences & Devices under Executive Vice President Rajesh Jha and Cloud + AI under Executive VP Scott Guthrie. A couple of units that are currently part of Microsoft's AI + Research group are going to be moving into Guthrie's new organization. Windows and Devices chief Terry Myerson is leaving the company as part of the reorg.
Microsoft is making these moves because the PC market is no longer growing much, if at all. Its cloud and subscription businesses are growing, however. 
Now, some of the company's recent strategy moves make more contextual sense. Last year, Microsoft laid the groundwork designed to make Windows part of a recurring subscription business via Microsoft 365, which is a bundle of Windows 10, Office 365, and elements of the Enterprise Security + Mobility service. It's also why Microsoft began designing products in a way that brought its Surface hardware, Office software, and Windows operating system together, rather than in their own respective silos.

Microsoft is hoping it can do with Windows what it did with Office. The company managed to turn its individual on-premises Office products into a cloud bundle with Office 365 -- which is growing even faster than Microsoft itself expected. (Microsoft officials have predicted the company could have two-thirds of its Office users in the cloud by its fiscal 2019.) Now, it's trying to do something similar for Windows with Microsoft 365: Create a bundle of cloud services anchored by Windows 10 that will provide the company with a recurring revenue stream.
With today's moves, Microsoft is not throwing in the towel on Windows or its Surface line. 
Panos Panay gets a new title -- chief product officer -- and still heads up devices. Joe Belfiore is leading the ""Windows client experience,"" meaning the shell and cross-device experiences like Edge and Launcher. Kudo Tsunoda is continuing to spearhead the NEXT (New Experiences and Technology) business, which had its own reorg earlier this year. And Corporate VP Brad Anderson, whose team joined the Windows organization late last year, will continue to run Windows Enterprise  Deployment and Management. All of these people will report to Jha.
Microsoft is moving some of Myerson's other former lieutenants to Guthrie's Cloud & AI division. Jason Zander, who is being promoted to executive vice president under Guthrie, will lead the newly combined Azure and Windows platform teams. The thinking is by bringing Windows client, server, and cloud all together, Microsoft will be able to better build a common infrastructure and application model across all flavors of Windows. Roanne Sones, who heads up technical engagement with OEMs and silicon vendors, will also be part of Zander's team.
Technical Fellow Alex Kipman gets a new role as part of today's reorganization, as well. He will continue to work on the HoloLens while also leading a new team called AI Perception & Mixed Reality Services, which will be part of Guthrie's organization. The new team will oversee all Microsoft's speech, vision, mixed reality, and other perception capabilities, and it will continue to build first-party experiences and cloud services for third parties on Azure. Kipman and team will work closely with Harry Shum on all things AI related.

Outside of Windows and Devices, there are a few other noteworthy org changes revealed today, especially around AI. While Kipman is taking on oversight of ""perception""-related AI services, the overall AI Platform, Tools and Cognition Services, including Azure ML, Cognitive Services, and the Bot Framework, will be folded into a new ""AI Platform, Tools and Cognitive Services"" team under Eric Boyd, as part of Guthrie's organization. Cloud AI Platform Corporate VP Joseph Sirosh will join this new group, as well. (These products/services were, up until now, part of Shum's AI + Research org.)
I'm hearing from my contacts there are not going to be layoffs associated with today's reorg. The moves today also will not change how Microsoft reports its financials.

Microsoft is starting to test two new data types that it plans to add to Excel.
New geography and stocks data types will be coming first to Office Insiders. Microsoft's plan is to have the Insiders test these and then start rolling the features out to Office 365 subscribers, starting with those with Commercial accounts and U.S. English, over the next few months.
To date, Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet has supported numbers and text types. But as Microsoft hooks up its applications and services to the Microsoft Knowledge Graph, these apps are getting smarter and able to handle more types of tasks.
TechRepublic: 10 things you should never do in Excel
""We're starting to add concepts inside cells, which will allow new things to be done with spreadsheets,"" said Rob Howard, Director of Office 365 Ecosystem Marketing.
Microsoft's Knowledge Graph, codenamed ""Satori,"" has evolved considerably, Howard said. It matches entities with the correct domains and is able to understand certain things about a given entity. The Knowledge Graph already powering Bing and Excel data types. It's this cloud-connected/Knowledge Graph connection that is behind Microsoft describing these new datatypes as AI-infused.
The new geography data type supports states, countries, zip codes and cities. Stocks includes ticker symbols, fund names, company names and can fetch up-to-date prices.Microsoft's strategy is to add more smart data types to Excel over time. 
In the future, Microsoft is likely to add organizational entity data, such as sales and CRM data, as supported types, officials said, but wouldn't share a timeframe as to when this might be enabled.

Outgoing Windows chief Terry Myerson looks back and ahead in his goodbye mail to Microsoft employees. Here's what he told them.

 	Microsoft is splitting up its Windows and Devices Group as part of a company-wide reorganization. As a result, 21-year Microsoft veteran and executive vice president Terry Myerson is leaving the company.
 Must read: Here's how (and why) Microsoft is splitting up Windows in its latest reorg | Windows chief Myerson out in Microsoft reorganization
 	Myerson became head of the Windows and Devices Group in 2013. Since then, he has been overseeing 17,000 engineers. Microsoft is approaching 700 million active Windows 10 users now.
 	In his email to the company's employees, Myerson said he had been discussing his departure with CEO Satya Nadella ""for some time."" He said his next priorities are to train for a half  Ironman, learn to play piano or guitar, and learn more about genomics and robotics, plus spend more time with his family.
 	Here's Myerson's March 29 mail to Microsoft employees (which Microsoft also posted to LinkedIn):
 Thank you for 21 years, and onto the next chapter...
 	It is an emotional day for me as I look toward starting my next chapter outside of Microsoft in a few months. Satya and I have been discussing this for some time, but today it becomes real. Actually sharing the news with the team, customers, and partners has been an incredibly intense experience. Microsoft has been my work, my team, and my purpose for 21 years.
 	The decision comes with a lot of reflection and special memories of the past two decades. With a blog like this, hopefully I can share a few lessons learned, and my ongoing enthusiasm for Microsoft.
 	 It's surreal to look back on how it all started. I recall meeting Bill Gates in 1996 as Microsoft was evaluating buying Intersé, one of the earliest Internet companies, which I founded with Midori Chan and Ed Hott way back in 1994. During our meeting, I remember being at the whiteboard explaining how we could infer a user's path through a web site based upon referring URL's in the website traffic logs (ok, this probably sounds very basic now, but it was advanced in those days!). I remember discussing with Bill how caching impacted the logs. I remember us both drinking ""free"" Diet Coke. I loved the discussion. I couldn't believe the CEO would dig into details at this level. Our discussion left me really wanting to join the team, and it was the beginning of my love for designing great software with the people at Microsoft. It's incredible to think that of the ~20 people who joined Microsoft in March 1997 from Intersé, five are still here (including both Midori and Ed, and Harvinder Bhela who helps lead Windows today, and Rajesh Potti, a developer on Office 365).
 	1997-2000
 	 It's hard to believe that on my first day at Microsoft I met Satya, as we worked together on Site Server. I vividly recall attending a Seattle Mariners game with him in the late 90's when he first shared with me about his son and his medical challenges. I grew up a little that day. It's amazing what he has done as CEO. I believe in the strategy and vision the company is pursuing, and the leadership team here to make it happen.
 	Joining a large company after being CEO of a startup is certainly an adjustment. I moved from Silicon Valley to Seattle. My title changed from ""CEO"" to ""Product Unit Manager"". I had a boss. But wow, Microsoft opened the world to me. I left the country for the first time in my life, talking to customers in Europe, Australia, Africa, and Asia about our work. My development team grew to over 100 people. I didn't have to worry about real estate or health care. A team of people was there to help with recruiting. Microsoft provided an environment and the resources to dream big, like I had never experienced before. I was hooked.
 	 A short time after joining, while at a volunteer event for Seattle Works, I met Katie. She was teaching 1st grade to English as a 2nd language students. She was so honest, smart, beautiful, and fun. Luckily for me, she eventually agreed to be my wife.
 	2001-2008
 	 After Site Server, Perry Clarke convinced me to join him on the Exchange team. For the following 8 years, Exchange became my purpose. I learned so much about being a leader and running a large-scale software business during this time. It's crazy to look back at the Exchange team I joined, with a tightly coupled on-premise server design, low share vs Lotus Notes, and under $500M in revenue. Over the following 8 years we built the beginnings of today's cloud scale Office 365, became the leader in enterprise communications, and grew the business to over $2B.
 	Katie and I had all 3 of our kids while I worked on Exchange. I will always love the Exchange team, customers, and partners. Some of the many great people I got to work with in these years were Dave Thompson, Jason Mayans, Vivek Sharma, Karim Batthish, Vanessa Feliberti, Mike Swafford, Naresh Sundaram, Jim Kleewein, David Lemson, Russ Simpson, Jim Van Eaton, Jon Avner, and Ian Jose. Exchange 2003 was codenamed Titanium (aka Ti), and in my office today, my wall has a picture of the Exchange team on the fields in front of our building.
 	 Looking back at my biggest learnings from Exchange, the biggest lessons centered around how to get a big engineering team to work well together- leveraging customer feedback loops to create intensity and energy, getting the team aligned around a shared schedule to create well integrated work, and the importance of consistently communicating to a large group of people to keep everyone in sync.
 	2008-2013
 	 Then came October 2008. Over a year earlier, just prior to the iPhone launch, I was personally involved in negotiating the Exchange ActiveSync license with Apple. I was carrying a 2007 v1 iPhone (which I still have in my office today). I was an outspoken lover of smartphones and knew how important they would be. Enabling mobile connectivity was a key focus of Exchange. Android launched that September. But what I remember most vividly, was the Friday when Andy Lees and Robbie Bach asked me to lead Windows Mobile. I knew we had so much work to do on our non-touch no-app-store Windows Mobile effort. I was honored, and more than a little terrified. 10 days later my office moved across campus.
 	The Windows Phone experience was incredibly challenging, and much has been written about it - but looking back, I am so proud to have been part of the team. It was during this time that I started working closely with current Windows leaders Henry Sanders, Joe Belfiore, Darren Laybourn, Bill Duff, Carlos Picoto, Chuck Friedman, Linda Norman, Chadd Knowlton, Richard Ward, KC Lemson, Erin Kolb, and Albert Shum. We innovated in phone user experience. We had innovative plans for the business model that never came to light. We worked hard. Really hard. But the industry moved forward faster than we could catch up.
 	When the #1 seeded UVA basketball team got knocked out of the tournament a few weeks ago in the first round, my Intersé colleague and UVA alum Ed Hott posted a famous Teddy Roosevelt quote to his Facebook feed. Today, reflecting on the experience of everyone in the Windows Phone team, this quote resonates.
 	Looking back at this phase of my career, my biggest learnings were that success requires a special composition of business model, user experience, and technology. We had a differentiated experience, but it's so clear in hindsight that the disruption in business model which Android represented was enormous, and that building our early versions of Windows Phone on an incomplete Windows CE platform, designed for small embedded systems, left us too hobbled to ever catch up.
 	2013-now
 	Then came spring 2013. At this time, despite the competitive challenges in the phone market, Windows Phone was doing relatively ok (which lead us to Nokia...) Ironically at that time, our biggest challenges were on the storied franchises of Windows (Windows 8) and Xbox. While meeting with Steve Ballmer on a Saturday in his office, he asked me to lead Xbox, Windows, and Windows Phone - and an incredible incubation now known as HoloLens. I was honored, and humbled to now be leading over 17,000 engineers and accountable for over $40B in revenue and $5B in operating income--but we had some real challenges. Over the coming months, we made some hard prioritization calls and made a multiyear commitment to get after it. Watching a team of Microsoft engineers reorient, get focused, and drive on a multiyear journey of deep technical innovation is a sight to behold. It is one of the purest expressions of Microsoft's capability to create. Today, I have a deep sense of pride in the great brands that are Windows 10, Xbox One, and the Surface family of devices we created together.
 	Panos Panay, Phil Spencer, Alex Kipman, Roanne Sones, Dave Treadwell, Mike Fortin, Eric Lockard, Kudo Tsunoda, Nick Parker, Brad Anderson, Don Box, Gabe Aul, Kevin Dallas, Stevie Bathiche, Brett Ostrum, Yusuf Mehdi, Ilan Spillinger, Linda Averett, Mike Zintel, Mike Ybarra, David Hufford, Kareem Choudhry, Chuck Chan, Bonnie Ross, Matt Booty, Lydia Winters, and so many other leaders stand out for me during this phase of my journey.
 	On my wall next to the Exchange team, will always be a picture of our Windows and Devices team. Again, out on the field (a much bigger field than we used for Exchange!) in configuration of the 12th man, to support the Seattle Seahawks as they headed to the Superbowl in 2014.
 	A few weeks after we took this photo, Satya became CEO.
 	One of my favorite things about leading Windows has been the Windows fans. Through good times and bad, I've loved your feedback. I've loved your passion for our work. I've loved your applause when we've done great work and I've loved the push to do better. One of my deeply held lessons from my Exchange days was the importance of that feedback loop with customers and fans, and that's why we created the Windows Insider Program so we could build Windows 10 led by your feedback. Now with 15 million members, you continue to make our product and our team better each and every day. Thank you.
 	Today, we are now approaching 700 million active Windows 10 users, commercial usage is growing 84% year over year, Xbox One is running a Windows 10 core, Surface is leading PC innovation, HoloLens is bringing breakthroughs to computer vision, our universal Microsoft store enables Xbox GamePass, Azure reserved instances, and Office distribution, and the OEM ecosystem is revitalized with profitable growth. Last year, we finished the year with over $8B in operating income from our segment.
 	My lessons from having the honor to lead Windows are many, but three really shine through to me today:
 	Technology really can empower people to do great things. While that may just sound like a soundbite, the last few years I have felt it in new and meaningful ways, making me a real optimist about our future. Amongst so many other things, Windows has been a platform to consider basic human creativity, how students will learn in the future, how surgeons can will operate in the future, and how people who are blind can use their device without a display.
 	Broadly define who is on your team. The passion, commitment, and sheer brilliance of the people across Microsoft has kept me inspired for 21 years. I am so proud of the teams I have had the honor to lead. Windows has taught me to appreciate that some of my best teammates are at other companies like Intel, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, AMD, Qualcomm, Samsung, Best Buy, Adobe, Autodesk, Activision, Electronic Arts, and so many others. We have worked together to move the industry forward, creating opportunity for so many along the way.
 	Have fun with it. My Microsoft journey has included some challenging days, but I barely remember them. Looking at a photo collection today, I see so many self-deprecating moments where our leaders have had some real fun. I have dressed up as Big Bird, a clown (a few times), Captain Kirk (twice), and Santa. I've been thrown in a lake (a few times). I have dressed as Braveheart's William Wallace and ridden a live horse into a team meeting (once). I have laughed so hard I've cried (many times). I will cherish these memories of sheer fun with the team as much as anything else I take away from my 21 years at Microsoft.
 	So after working fulltime pretty much nonstop since I was 18, missing many a kids birthday while traveling for work, I'm ready for a break. I will now take some time to train for a half Ironman, learn to play the piano or guitar (my daughter is voting guitar, but having listened to Joe Belfiore and Chuck Friedman play piano on so many late nights, I'm leaning that way), learning more about genomics and robotics which fascinate me, and spending some overdue quality time with Katie and our kids. I couldn't be more appreciative of the support which Katie has shown me while I've been giving my all to Microsoft, and now I am excited to spend some unrushed time together.
 	As I look back, I remember one particular afternoon a few years ago when I went for a walk around campus with the young founders of Beam who we had recently acquired (to help create Xbox Mixer!). That afternoon, I felt like I was going for a walk with my younger self, joining Microsoft with limitless enthusiasm, and eager to do great things. It was inspiring to welcome these incredible people, a new generation at Microsoft. I see this same energy and enthusiasm across Microsoft right now - a sure sign of even greater and more amazing things to come for this company.
 	Leaving fills me with many emotions. But I'm mostly filled with gratitude and optimism - gratitude for the experiences I have had and optimism for the future ahead - both for Microsoft and myself.
 	-Terry

Although applying artificial intelligence (AI) is a challenge for enterprises, and budget is an issue, most brands believe that AI will bring success according to new report.

Video: Microsoft hits ""human milestone"" with Chinese-to-English machine translator
 IDC  predicts that global spending on cognitive and AI systems is forecast to reach $57.6 billion in 2021.
 	In a follow-up to its 2017 survey on the future of marketing and content,   Foster City, Calif-based organic search and content platform BrightEdge  has released new findings from a survey of Fortune 500 marketers.
Read also: Worried about your job? AI can beat humans in converting leads to sales
 	It surveyed 500 people during February 2018. The online survey contained  eight questions related to the future of marketing and the challenges,  solutions, and adoption of AI.
 	The findings point to increased adoption rates during 2017 and highlighted  the benefits and obstacles of artificial intelligence.
 	The top three responses to its question about the next big trends question  are all AI applications.  Consumer personalization (28.66 percent), artificial intelligence  (25.69 percent), and voice search (21.23 percent) were the trends  most favoured.
All three items  -- totaling 75 percent -- are AI applications,  which shows that AI is more pervasive than respondents realize. Sixty percent of respondents said they are likely to incorporate AI into their  content marketing strategy -- a rise of 17  percen from last year's 43  percent response.
 	Many people are unaware they are using AI. It is very similar to interacting  with traditionally programmed PCs or mobile devices. The differentiator is that  AI has a neural network, algorithms, and big data, which helps AI better  understand inputs and provide more accurate outputs.
 	Respondents said that the greatest reported benefit of AI is better  understanding of the customer and driving productivity and time savings.
Read also: New AI technology takes the guesswork out of influencer marketing campaigns
 	Although almost half of respondents see a constructive role for AI, the  greatest deterrents to AI adoption are confusion on the definition of AI and a lack of budget, according to the report.
 	We are already interacting with AI on a daily basis.  It is ubiquitous  and will permeate everything we do without our knowledge.  It impacts nearly  all aspects of life: we wear smart devices and talk to AI  voice assistants in our homes. Our gardens are watered and our houses are  kept safe and warm. Chatbots are used to help us purchase items, or answer  questions.
 AI takes  the guesswork out of influencer marketing campaigns, and AI assistants help  us with work email. Its adoption is growing year on year. Brands that use AI  see better productivity and time savings (27.39 percent) and even an increase on  ROI (8.07 percent).
 	As brands will overtake other companies who do not use AI, the case for  widespread adoption -- driven by the customer -- will ensure its continued growth  year on year. Savvy brands would do well to get ahead of the curve.
 How  ubiquitous AI will permeate everything we do without our knowledge.
 	Most of us do not know that we are using chatbots to talk to service agents,  so how will we know that AI will be seamlessly interacting in with our future  lives?
 Are  enterprises really ready for AI?
 	Businesses are facing setbacks around AI adoption -- with over half feeling  that they are not prepared to effectively use AI technologies in their  organisations.

As much as Apple tries to convince us that the iPad is a better tool for schools that the Chromebook, the iPad has a key weakness that Apple hasn't addressed.

Specs for Apple's new iPad 
 Earlier this week we saw Apple CEO Tim Cook take the stage with  a sales pitch designed to convince schools to end their love affair with Google's Chromebook and make a switch to the iPad.
 But the Chromebook still beats the iPad in one critical way.
 Must read:  iOS 11.3: Get your iPhone and iPad ready for the biggest update yet
 I'm talking about the keyboard.
 Yes, as simple a distinction as that seems, this is one key way that the Chromebook as the iPad totally beat. Whether we are talking about the on-screen keyboard, Apple's physical keyboard for the iPad, or the myriad of third-party keyboards out there that are available for the tablet, they all come a very distant second to the built-in physical keyboard found on the Chromebook.
 Yes, sure, you can make do with an iPad, and you might be able to do things with the iPad that you can't do with a Chromebook - such as record video or have access to AR - but as soon as you have more than a few hundred words to type, that keyboard problem is ready to bite you at a moment's notice.
 Oh, and bear in mind that if you do decide to kit out an iPad with a keyboard, that's going to add to the bottom line.
 And sure, Apple's tried to skirt around that keyboard problem by adding support for the Apple Pencil to the iPad (yet another accessory that costs money, and needs charging), but as awesome as that is for certain use cases, it's still doesn't make up for the lack of a keyboard.
 If the iPad really were the true laptop killer that Apple claims it is, Cook would have pulled the plug on the lower-end MacBooks.
 He hasn't done that.
 Oh, and if the lack of a built-in keyboard isn't a deal-breaker for you, then what about security?
 While the security of the iPad and the iOS platform is good, the simple, streamlined, no-brainer security model that Google has built around the Chromebook is better, especially when it comes to automatic patching.
 Patching iOS is nowhere near as simple and painless as keeping a Chromebook patched. And to be honest I'm not sure why Apple hasn't addressed this. Updating iOS devices feels far clumsier and needlessly messier than I'd expect from a 2018 product.
 But no matter what I think about the keyboard or the security model, Apple has made a reinvigorated bid to get schools to hand over their cash for iPads instead of Chromebooks. Google's Chromebook has nearly 60 percent market share in education now, according to FutureSource Consulting, so it's clear that the iPad is facing quite an uphill battle.
Only time - and keeping an eye on Apple's quarterly financials - will tell is this bid has been successful.

The company that created the Apache Zeppelin notebook project is introducing its first commercial offering aimed at managing collaboration. It will appeal to those who want lifecycle management to be an extension of their notebooks.

                                   By Tony Baer (Ovum)
            
                    
                    for Big on Data
        
                                        |            March 29, 2018 -- 12:00 GMT (05:00 PDT)
                
                                                                                            | Topic: Big Data Analytics

As we recounted a few weeks back, we once shared a flight with an aspiring data scientist who was shopping for colleges who preferred SAS for the completeness of its analytic programming functions. Then there are those who prefer the vitality of the open source community, like the R programmers who embrace the CRAN libraries. And then you have the granddaddy of them all: Python developers who have flocked to this nearly 30-year old programming language because of its simplicity and flexibility. Python was recently ranked by IEE Spectrum as the top programming language, and in the latest Tiobe index, ranks as number 5.
Python, like Java (which was first conceived for set-top boxes), was originally conceived for something else. As a general purpose language, it is used by systems operators and web developers alike, but who would have guessed that it would become arguably the most popular language for data scientists?
It shouldn't be surprising that some data science tools are likewise exploiting their home court advantages. Anaconda, the commercial venture that has supported delivery of the eponymous open source packages for Python, bills itself as ""The Most Popular Python Data Science Platform."" It provides the management infrastructure that is typically lacking from the free open source distribution.
Likewise, there are bloodlines that often drive the preferences for data science notebooks. Not surprisingly, there is a plethora of notebooks to choose from.
Capitalizing on its IPython heritage, the Jupyter notebook's popularity with Python developers has served as a springboard for appealing to a broader community. As the outgrowth of iPython, first created in 2001 and taking its current form (and name) in 2014), the Jupyter notebook is hailed for its ease of coding; there are plenty of programming shortcuts, and as the outgrowth of IPython, native support for Python package outputs.
While Jupyter had its origins with developers working with data on laptops, Zeppelin was conceived for a multi-polar world of distributed big data platforms (Jupyter has since adapted). So it has adapters (the exact term is ""interpreters"") to Hadoop components, Cassandra, HBase, JDBC, Spark, Flink and others (including Python, by the way). And compared to Jupyter, you can more readily mix and match code from different programming languages in a single notebook or project. If you're interested, here's a good discussion on the relative merits of Jupyter vs. Zeppelin.
Given the demand for data scientists to become more productive and connected to the enterprise, it shouldn't be surprising that there is a rapidly rising ecosystem of data science collaboration, lifecycle management, and development tools that embed or support notebooks. But for those who want to take more bottom-up approaches to scaling their work with notebooks, it's also not surprising that there are projects (and commercial efforts) to develop tools shaped around the notebooks that are for many data scientists the primary tools of choice.
Recently, my Big on Data bro Andrew Brust provided the blow by blow description of Jupyter Lab, which expands the notebook into more of an IDE. Now it's Zeppelin's turn.
ZEPL is the commercial entity formed by the creators of the Apache Zeppelin project. This week, they are releasing a collaborative platform that expands on Zeppelin, but won't leave Jupyter out in the cold either. In essence, it is a collaborative management offering that bolts onto the notebook, providing the version and access control that basic notebook lacks.
It builds on Zeppelin's existing support of real-time visualizations, plus integration with Active Directory and LDAP. On that, it adds a new capability for creating and sharing private workspaces that may consist of one or more notebooks. And it manages permissions to compute resources for read/write, execution, and sharing of notebooks within specific workspaces.
On the roadmap, it plans to add support for managing workspaces on external clusters and VPC support for virtual private clouds.
As noted, Jupyter notebooks are not left out. But, not surprisingly, the integration is not as direct; the contents of Jupyter notebooks must be translated into formats that render in the Zeppelin format. In an ecosystem where numerous players, from IBM to Cloudera, Dataiku, Data Robot, Domino Data Lab and others, are also targeting the challenge of data science lifecycle management, ZEPL's sweet spot will likely be those Zeppelin users who want the management function to operate as an extension of their notebooks.

Monero-mining Android malware will exhaust your phone in its quest for cash.

                                   By Steve Ranger

Video: Turn your Android smartphone into a bunker with 10 simple steps
A new strain of Android malware will continuously use an infected device's CPU to mine the Monero cryptocurrency until the device is exhausted or even breaks down.
Security company Trend Micro has named the malware HiddenMiner because of the techniques it uses to protect itself from discovery and removal. 
Like most cryptocurrency-mining software, HiddenMiner uses the device's CPU power to mine Monero. But Trend Micro said that because there is no switch, controller, or optimizer in HiddenMiner's code it will continuously mine Monero until the device's resources are exhausted. 
""Given HiddenMiner's nature, it could cause the affected device to overheat and potentially fail,"" the company said.
If the researchers' concerns are correct, this is not the first cryptocurrency-mining malware to put your smartphone at risk: last year the Loapi Android malware worked a phone so hard that its battery swelled up and burst open the device's back cover, wrecking the handset within 48 hours.
See also: Cybersecurity strategy research: Common tactics, issues with implementation, and effectiveness
Trend Micro said the two pieces of malware share similarities, noting that Loapi's technique of locking the screen after revoking device administration permissions is analogous to HiddenMiner's. 
Researchers at the company identified the Monero mining pools and wallets connected to the malware, and spotted that one of its operators withdrew 26 XMR -- around $5,360 -- from one of the wallets. This, they said, indicates a ""rather active"" campaign of using infected devices to mine cryptocurrency.
HiddenMiner poses as a legitimate Google Play update app, and forces users to activate it as a device administrator. It will persistently pop up until victims click the Activate button; once granted permission, HiddenMiner will start mining Monero in the background.
It also attempts to hide itself on infected devices, for example by emptying the app label and using a transparent icon after installation. Once activated as device administrator, it will hide the app from the app launcher. The malware will hide itself and automatically run with device administrator permission until the next device boot. HiddenMiner also has anti-emulator capabilities to bypass detection and automated analysis. 
It's also hard to get rid of: users can't uninstall an active system admin package until device administrator privileges are removed first. But HiddenMiner locks the device's screen when a user wants to deactivate its device administrator privileges, taking advantage of a bug found in Android operating systems before Android 7.0 Nougat.
Trend Micro said that HiddenMiner is found in third-party app marketplaces and is affecting users in India and China, but it won't be a surprise if it spreads beyond these countries.
The emergence of this malware should reinforce the need for mobile security hygiene, said Trend Micro: download only from official app marketplaces; regularly update the device's OS, and be careful about the permissions you grant to applications.

Nation-state attackers are attempting to undermine trust in critical services -- so how do we go about stopping them?

                                   By Danny Palmer

 Video: The economic impact of Russian hacking on the Ukraine economy
 	While cyber-attacks focusing on stealing email or other data are still very much part of the threat landscape, some of the most advanced hacking operations are focusing on grander goals.
 	Some of these groups -- almost all nation-state backed -- are turning their attention to critical infrastructure including utilities firms and power plants, while others are attempting to  manipulate public attitudes and even elections through the use of fake news and other social media propaganda.
 	""It's not so much an attack on critical infrastructure, but rather an attack on the confidence and psychology of a nation,"" said Chris Inglis, former deputy director of the National Security Agency, speaking at World Cyber Security Congress event in London.
 	Attacking critical infrastructure and spreading disinformation is a powerful combination: after all, the reason that governments exist is to make sure the citizens of a country remain safe. Such tactics have been tried out in Ukraine over the last few years.
 	""We've now got a nation-state actor which is effectively holding at risk the Ukrainian power grid, who's managed to affect it and disrupt it twice at a time and place of their choosing -- and it could've been a lot worse,"" said Pete Cooper, non-resident senior fellow in the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank focusing on international affairs.
 	""We're really starting to see adversaries at nation-state level and down who are attacking trust in our critical services.""
 See also: Cyberwar: A guide to the frightening future of online conflict
 	Similar tactics are being used outside of Ukraine too. Last December, hackers intentionally used malware to shut down a critical infrastructure firm in the Middle East. Researchers at FireEye said this sort of approach has previously been carried out by Russian, Iranian, North Korean, US, and Israeli nation-state actors.
 	Not every attack that undermines confidence is necessarily a targeted one. Last year's WannaCry ransomware outbreak wasn't a direct attack on the UK's National Health Service, but hospitals and GP surgeries ended up becoming some of the most severely impacted victims, with doctors forced to cancel patients' operations and appointments as a result of the attack. It arguably undermined the public's trust in the resilience of the healthcare system.
 	""We've really got to think about the fact our adversaries are attacking more than just our technology. Our adversaries are now starting to critically undermine the trust that our stakeholders have,"" said Cooper.
 	There are many in the cybersecurity industry who would argue that technology alone can solve this problem -- protect systems with the relevant tools to keep them safe from attacks. But this is perhaps ignoring the wider issue: there isn't an antivirus product to protect against declining faith in big institutions, or to defend against fake news.
 	""The bigger system, that's the thing we have to defend, not just the technology. While we're focusing on protecting the technology, our adversaries are focused on attacking the system. And by attacking the system, they're critically undermining the trust in that system,"" said Cooper.
 	In order to achieve that, it can't just be about ""looking for our technology comfort blanket,"" he said, adding: ""we're going to find it lacking"".
 	The very nature of this form of cyberwarfare means it is often hard to attribute an attack to a particular group or state. However, governments are putting more effort into attribution as one way to shame -- and deter -- attackers. In some cases, researchers and law enforcement have been able to identify the culprits behind attacks: for example, WannaCry was attributed to North Korea.

 	Meanwhile, the finger has also been pointed at Russia for attempting to meddle in the 2016 US presidential election, and it has also been blamed for NotPetya, which initially targeted Ukraine but spread to infect organisations around the world, causing billions of dollars of damage.
 	""You take a look at what the North Koreans in spring 2017 [WannaCry]. Unless that behaviour is checked, we can expect a recurrence of that in 2018, 2019, 2020. It's a not a question of if, but rather a question of when,"" said Inglis.
 	The answer, he said, is some sort of reaction with ""consequences"" in retaliation to these attacks, otherwise the likes of Russia and North Korea will repeatedly launch campaigns to disrupt and undermine the West.
 	Governments should be in charge of any reaction. ""They can impose consequences; there can be collective action against other nation-states and entities that look like nation-states.""
 	But while the US has introduced additional sanctions on Russia for launching ""the most destructive and costly cyberattack in history"" in the form of NotPetya, it's beyond doubt that we haven't seen the last of attacks against critical infrastructure.
Cyber attribution isn't so important, even for nation states 
International agreements could make it easier to track down threats from the borderless cyber realm. Australia is at the forefront of cyber diplomacy, but elsewhere progress is stalling.
Prepare for increasing 'nation-state' cyberattacks with strategy, not technology 
A defensive enterprise cybersecurity plan is the only way to combat today's hackers.

The country hopes a smarter traffic system will improve the safety of emerging driving technology tests.

	South Korea plans to map major cities and establish a smart traffic system for autonomous driving.
This week, local media reported that the South Korean government wishes to prevent the kind of accidents that have already taken place in the US involving pedestrians and autonomous vehicles.
An Uber self-driving vehicle undergoing tests was involved in a fatal collision this month with a woman. 
Although a human driver was in attendance -- as required by law -- sadly, the pedestrian from Tempe, Arizona, was still struck by the car as she walked across the road.
Uber has temporarily stopped tests in Arizona and all other cities, and the fatality has highlighted the risk of accidents -- leading to scrutiny in the self-driving space by government officials and technology vendors themselves worldwide.
As a result of the incident, South Korean officials are now planning to set up a ""smart"" traffic system to make sure such tests and pilot schemes are as of little risk to pedestrians as possible.
The country's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport said on Tuesday that research is underway to establish a smart traffic system and to create detailed road maps for self-driving vehicles.
Regulators are also going to examine the rules and regulations around self-driving car tests.
Under the project name Cooperative Intelligence Transport Systems (C-ITS), the team will also develop technologies which may help vehicles navigate city roads at night and in poor weather conditions.
There is an operational test bed site in the country called K-City located in Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province. The test zone will now also have environment simulators installed for technology vendors to try out their vehicles in different conditions and eradicate as many potential safety issues as possible.

Several autonomous vehicle trials are already underway in South Korea. 
SK Telecom and the Korean Transportation Safety Authority have already completed a ""cooperative driving"" trial in K-City, in which driverless cars exchanged information over 5G networks to travel safely down a highway and pedestrian areas.
In January, KT Corp. gained approval to test a 45-seat autonomous bus on public roads.
On Thursday, reports surfaced which suggest that Uber and the family of the pedestrian killed this month have reached a settlement out of court.

The future of warfare lies in large numbers of inexpensive, unmanned tactical platforms that can operate in concert with one another

A PD-100 drone by Prox Dynamics
Under a DARPA project aimed at creating new tactical tools for small infantry units, Raytheon and other defense contractors and research institutions are developing technology to control swarms of small aerial drones.
It's part of a wider move toward automation and unmanned systems by war planners in the U.S. and elsewhere, including Israel and Russia.
The U.S. has been ramping up development of military robots. The Army recently conducted range tests of autonomous ground vehicles with unmanned weapons systems aboard.
A few years ago an Army general touched off a small media frenzy when he stated on record that a quarter of U.S. Troops will be replaced by autonomous or remote-controlled machines by 2030.
Raytheon has been working on drone swarms for some time. In 2015, the defense contractor participated in the Office of Naval Research's LOCUST program, successfully networking 30 UAVs in a swarm.
War planners view weapons and surveillance platforms that operate as swarms as advantageous in tactical situations in part because they're difficult to defend against.
They're also cheaper than so so-called ""exquisitely manned systems,"" such as jet fighters and tanks. If you envision a swarm as a cluster of relatively inexpensive distributed sensor platforms, it's easy to see the economic benefits in cases where some loss is likely to occur.
You can easily replace 20 percent of a drone swarm, but losing 20 percent of a jet fighter will ground the system.
But those benefits could have severe consequences for when and how wars are fought, potentially increasing the likelihood of armed engagement.
In 2014, the Center for New American Security released a report titled ""20YY: Preparing for War in the Robotic Age,"" which predicted a major shift toward smaller, cheaper unmanned platforms that can operate in network with one another.
One of the report's more dire findings was that military leaders will be more likely to engage an enemy using inexpensive, unmanned robots because the immediate consequences, both in terms of the risk of casualties and potential loss of weapons systems, are drastically reduced.
The increased likelihood of combat engagement, however, would almost certainly lead to more conflict overall and could precipitate major wars. 
The current DARPA project, which is called the OFFensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics (OFFSET) program, ""envisions future small-unit infantry forces using swarms comprising upwards of 250 small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and/or small unmanned ground systems (UGSs) to accomplish diverse missions in complex urban environments.""
Raytheon is developing a ""drag and drop"" interface to control networked drones, as well as a virtual simulator to test its communications technology. 
Eventually the contractor will produce a physical swarm to test.
""Operators use speech or gestures to control the swarm,"" explains Shane Clark, a principal investigator on the program. ""This is a tremendous advantage during operations. The system provides sensor feeds and mission status indicators for complete situational awareness.""
Raytheon had sales of $25 billion last year. The contractor does business with more than 80 countries.

After reports emerged that the aerospace giant had fallen victim to the WannaCry ransomware, Boeing downplayed the production impact, labelling it a 'limited intrusion' of malware.

Boeing 787 Dreamliner 
 After reports emerged on Wednesday afternoon that Boeing had found itself the latest victim of the  WannaCry ransomware attack, the company issued a statement to explain that its cybersecurity operations centre had merely detected a ""limited intrusion"" of malware that had affected a small number of its systems.
Although ZDNet has reached out to Boeing for comment, a statement issued to sister site CNET downplays the concerns over the company's production impact.
 ""A number of articles on a malware disruption are overstated and inaccurate,"" Linda Mills, vice president of Boeing commercial airplanes communications, told CNET.
 ""Our cybersecurity operations center detected a limited intrusion of malware that affected a small number of systems. Remediations were applied and this is not a production or delivery issue.""
 Claims Boeing had been struck by the virus that caused global panic when it spread last year were made after the company's commercial airplane chief engineer Mike VanderWel distributed a memo to staff that called for ""all hands on deck"".
 ""It is metastasizing rapidly out of North Charleston and I just heard 777 (automated spar assembly tools) may have gone down,"" the  Seattle Times reported VanderWel as writing in the memo. He reportedly added that he was concerned the virus would hit equipment used in functional tests of planes ready to roll out and potentially ""spread to airplane software"".
 The WannaCry ransomware, labelled the biggest challenge of 2017, saw ransomware spread with the help of a leaked NSA exploit and infect over 300,000 PCs at major organisations around the globe.
 The United Kingdom's National Health Service was one of the highest-profile victims of the attack, with 47 trusts and foundation trusts affected. The ransomware forced a number of hospitals offline and  some took weeks to recover. 
 The United States and its Five Eyes partners blamed the WannaCry ransomware attack on North Korea in December.

DocuSign, the e-signature and digital transaction management firm, has filed to go public on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol ""DOCU."".
In its S-1 form filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it brought in $381.5 million in revenue for the fiscal year that ended January 31, 2017, representing 52 percent year-over-year growth. It reported a net loss of  $115.4 million for the fiscal year ending January 2017. For the fiscal year ending in 2016, its net loss came to $122.6 million.
The company, founded in 2003, has more than 350,000 companies using its cloud-based platform. It counts seven of the top 10 global technology companies among its customers, as well as 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies and 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies. 
While DocuSign continues to grow, it notes under ""risks"" that ""we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future."" 
The company noted its significant investment in research and development -- more than $300 million -- and noted that its total addressable market is an estimated $25 billion. The company also recently acquired the technology and core team members from machine learning startup Appuri, known for its segmentation technology that lets companies deliver targeted marketing messages and product recommendations.
Among other risks, DocuSign also noted that its security measures ""have on occasion in the past been, and may in the future be, compromised."" Last year, DocuSign revealed a data breach that allowed malicious actors to conduct a wide-ranging phishing campaign. Last month, IBM researchers said criminals were using spoofed DocuSign login pages for a phishing campaign on more than 100 compromised websites.

Video: How could tech giants stop fake news: Hire humans
Google on Wednesday announced an update to Hire, a recruiting app designed for small and medium-sized businesses that use G Suite. The app now has a feature in beta called candidate discovery, which helps recruiters find past job candidates who could be a good fit for new openings.
To highlight what a time-saver this could be for recruiters, Google points out that companies typically engage with around 250 candidates before filling a position. 
The new tool makes it easy to review past candidates, Google said, by creating a list based on a candidate's job description, location, and how their profile matches up with the new opening. When recruiters search for qualified prior candidates, they don't need to worry about using precise search keywords. For instance, Google said the feature could take a phrase like ""sales manager Bay Area"" and bring back candidates with relevant job skills who are based in Bay Area cities. 
Additionally, the tool lets recruiters filter results based on previous interactions with candidates. For instance, a recruiter may only want to review candidates who were previously offered a job or received positive feedback from an interview.

AI can help insurance carriers establish themselves as digital insurers.

Video: Apple and Cisco team up on cybersecurity insurance
In their quest to become digital insurers, insurance carriers have a revolutionary opportunity to improve their businesses with emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It is certainly a balancing act to find that perfect peanut butter-and-jelly combination of operational efficiency and customer engagement. However, I believe many insurance carriers to be up to the task -- with the right guidance at least.

When determining how to make these AI investments, there is much to consider -- from managing risk exposure and fraud detection to understanding your customers' needs and how your insurance products and services deliver the experience expected by consumers. Forrester identified 12 AI technologies and solutions that can help insurers achieve improved operational efficiencies and better customer experience (CX). AI is currently not pervasive in insurance; however, insurers have experimented with AI in four primary focus areas:
While each of these focus areas have strengths and weaknesses, the most important aspect of choosing which AI technology to invest in is what your company needs. Those investing in these AI technologies must consider exactly what his or her company will most benefit from, and which technology will be most helpful in enabling that company to reach its goals. AI technologies enable companies to break the glass ceiling and focus more on its clients, which will lead to a successful navigation for insurance carriers into the world of becoming digital insurers.

Video: How Docker brought containers mainstream
Insiders knew this had been coming for months, but today, Solomon Hykes, Docker's founder, announced he was leaving day-to-day work at the leading container company.
He wrote, ""I'm announcing my departure from Docker, the company I helped create ten years ago and have been building ever since. A founder's departure is usually seen as a dramatic event. Sadly, I must report that reality is far less exciting in this case. I've had many roles at Docker over the years, and today I have a new, final one - as an active board member, a major shareholder and, I expect, a high maintenance Docker user. But I will no longer be part of day-to-day operations.""
This move comes almost a year after his co-founder, Ben Golub, stepped down as CEO. As for Hykes, he started moving away from Docker's executive team  in November 2017. He went from being CTO to vice chairman of the board of directors and chief architect.
Besides being a leader, Hykes has been the controversial face of Docker. In 2016, for example, he started a tempest in the container world by tweeting: ""OCI (Open Container Initiative) image format is a fake standard."" This open-source standard for container specification was supported by other container companies, such as CoreOS, and his own company.
Now that Hykes is leaving, he says, ""Docker has quietly transformed into an enterprise business with explosive revenue growth and a developer community in the millions, under the leadership of our CEO, the legendary Steve Singh. Our strategy is simple: every large enterprise in the world is preparing to migrate their applications and infrastructure to the cloud, en masse. They need a solution to do so reliably and securely, without expensive code or process changes, and without locking themselves to a single operating system or cloud. Today the only solution meeting these requirements is Docker Enterprise Edition.""
Sources indicate, however, that while Docker, the technology, is continuing to grow great guns, Docker's business growth has been more challenging. 
As Hykes says, ""This puts Docker at the center of a massive growth opportunity. To take advantage of this opportunity, we need a CTO by Steve's side with decades of experience shipping and supporting software for the largest corporations in the world. So I now have a new role: to help find that ideal CTO, provide the occasional bit of advice, and get out of the team's way as they continue to build a juggernaut of a business.""
Hykes concludes, ""It's never easy for a founder to part ways with their life's work. But I realize how incredibly lucky I am to have this problem. Most ideas never materialize. Most software goes unused. Most businesses fail in their first year. Yet here we are, one of the largest open-source communities ever assembled, collectively building software that will run on millions of computers around the world. To know that your work was meaningful, and that a vibrant community of people will continue building upon it... can any founder ask for anything more?""
No. No they can't.

The chipmaker already dominates the market for training deep neural networks. At its annual GPU Technology Conference, Nvidia made the case for using GPUs not only to train ever bigger models, but also to run these neural networks in data centers to revolutionize industries.

When Nvidia held its first annual GPU Technology Conference almost a decade ago, it was a gaming company is search of new markets for its specialized chips. At the time, high-performance computing was the main target. Then, AlexNet came along and swept the ImageNet challenge in 2012, sparking a boom in deep neural networks trained on GPUs.

Today, Nvidia's data center business generates $2 billion in annual sales leaving larger rivals playing catch up while venture capitalists throw money at AI hardware start-ups vying to build a better mousetrap.
Nvidia no longer needs to make the case for GPU computing. Instead, CEO Jensen Huang's job at the opening keynote of GTC 2018 was to convince the 8,500 developers in attendance that the company can maintain its edge over the competition and bring the benefits of AI to a broader audience.

One of the best decisions the company made, Huang said, was a bet that the same processors used to play games would become more general-purpose hardware. Nvidia's CUDA GPU computing platform has since been downloaded more than eight million times and the world's 50 fastest supercomputers now rely on GPU accelerators to provide 370 petaflops of horsepower. ""Clearly the adoption of GPU computing is growing, and it is growing at quite a fast rate,"" he said.
The reason for this is that new architectures, interconnects, algorithms, and systems have enabled GPUs to scale rapidly. Over the past five years, Moore's Law has increased CPU performance by five times, but GPUs have accelerated molecular dynamics simulations by a factor of 25. A traditional HPC cluster with 600 dual-CPU servers consuming 600kW can now be replaced with 30 quad-Tesla V100 servers consuming 48kW. And future exascale systems will allow simulations that take months to run in a single day, though scientists will in turn create larger simulations. ""There's a new law going on,"" Huang said. ""The world needs larger computers because there is serious work to be done.""

A similar evolution is taking place in deep learning. The AlexNet convolutional neural network (CNN) was eight layers deep and had millions of parameters. Five years later, we have had a ""Cambrian explosion"" of CNNs, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), reinforcement learning, and new species such as Capsule Nets. These neural network models have increased in complexity 500 times to hundreds of layers and billions of parameters, creating demand for faster hardware. ""The world wants a gigantic GPU,"" Huang said.
Nvidia's answer to that is the DGX-2, a new server that packs 16 Tesla V100 'equivalents' each with 32GB of stacked High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) -- a total of 81,920 CUDA cores and 512GB of HBM2 -- all connected over new, high-speed switch. The server also includes two Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs, 1.5TB of system memory, 30TB of NVMe solid-state storage, and InfiniBand EDR, and 100Gbps Ethernet networking. The system can deliver peak performance of 2 petaflops for deep learning (Tensor Cores) compared with 170 teraflops for the original Pascal-based DGX-1 and 960 teraflops with the Volta upgrade. The AlexNet model that took six days to train on two GeForce GTX 580s would take just 18 minutes to train on the DGX-2, and at the opposite extreme, Facebook's fairseq model for machine translation that requires 15 days to train could be completed in 1.5 days. The DGX-2 will cost $400,000 and will be available starting in the third quarter.
The growing complexity of AI systems and software has led to a push to make it available as a service in the cloud. The Nvidia GPU Cloud is a registry of containers that contain the software needed to run specific workloads on premises on a DGX system or in the cloud. At GTC, Nvidia announced that GPU Cloud now has 30 optimized GPU containers and is available on not only AWS, but also on Google Cloud Platform, AliCloud, and Oracle Cloud.
The company also announced an updated version of its TensorRT runtime for deep learning inference that optimizes and runs trained models on Nvidia GPUs in data centers. TensorRT 4 now supports RNNs, optimization for Kaldi speech recognition framework, and the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) that allows interoperability between frameworks such as Caffe, PyTorch, MXNet, and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit/WindowsML. Nvidia said that TensorRT 4 can speed up performance on image and video by up to 190 times; natural-language processing by 50 times; speech recognition by 60 times; speech synthesis by 36 times; and recommendation engines using collaborative filtering by 45 times.
The final, and perhaps most significant, cloud announcement was support for Kubernetes, the open-source software for deploying and managing containerized applications. In an impressive demonstration, Nvidia showed how it could scale an image classification model for flowers from a CPU at four flower types per second to a single GPU at 873 flowers per second to Nvidia's own Saturn V GPU cluster. By using the Kubernetes Load Balancer, it can easily add replicas of containers scaling the system to run at nearly 7,000 flower types per second. It also works across multiple clouds. When it took down some of the Saturn V replicas, the system automatically failed over to AWS GPU instances and continued to run the model at the same high-performance level.

While the focus of GTC is GPU computing, Nvidia did make some graphics news as well. The company announced a new workstation GPU that, when combined with the RTX ray tracing technology announced at last week's Game Developers Conference, can enable real-time, cinematic quality rendering.
To demonstrate the capabilities of RTX, Steven Parker, vice president of Professional Graphics, showed storm trooper scenes using Industrial Light & Magic's Star Wars assets and developed with Epic Games' Unreal Engine, rendered in real time. Huang said that with RTX a traditional render farm with 280 dual-core CPU servers burning 168kW can be replaced 14 quad-GPU servers using 24kW ""This is a big deal because for the very first time we can bring real-time ray tracing to the market,"" Huang said. ""People can actually use it."" Developers access RTX through a ray tracing extension to Microsoft DirectX 12, Nvidia's own OptiX API, and soon the Khronos Group's Vulkan graphics standard.
Manufactured on TSMC's 12nm process, the GV100 is the first Quadro GPU based on the Volta architecture, and it has 5,120 CUDA cores, 32GB of HBM2 stacked memory, and 640 Tensor Cores. Two of these GV100 GPUs can be combined over a new NVLink2 interconnect to create a single GPU with 64GB of HBM2 memory capable of delivering peak performance of nearly 30 teraflops single-precision (FP32). Dell, Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo will offer workstations with the Quadro GV100 starting in April.
This year, Nvidia did not bring customers on stage, though it is clearly working with hundreds of partners across many industries and Huang spent a lot of time talking about the applications of all of this technology. ""AI and autonomous machines will help revolutionize just about every industry,"" he predicted.
One of the more promising areas is medical imaging where deep learning is already having an impact on diagnosis and treatment of disease, as illustrated by the difference between 15-year-old ultrasound image of a fetus and the 3D/4D images captured by Philips latest EPIQ ultrasound. The problem, Huang said, is that there are millions of medical imaging devices installed around the world, but only 100,000 news ones are purchased each year, so it will take decades to replace this legacy technology. Nvidia's solution is Project Clara, a remote, virtualized data center that takes images from existing devices and performs post-processing in the cloud to produce modern, volumetric images.
Nvidia's most high-profile application, though, is automotive, where it has made a massive, multi-year bet on end-to-end systems for ADAS (advanced driver assistance) and autonomous driving. In a bit of unfortunate timing, during the keynote news broke that Nvidia had suspended its autonomous driving program in the wake of Uber's fatal crash, pushing the chipmaker's shares down sharply. In a press session afterward, Huang explained that Nvidia was taking a cautious approach to self-driving to ensure the safety of its engineers and to get it right. ""We are trying to create an autonomous vehicle computing system and infrastructure so that the entire industry can take advantage of the investment we are making,"" Huang said.

Most development vehicles currently use Nvidia's Drive PX 2, which has two Tegra X2 SoCs (Parker) with Pascal graphics and consumes 250W. ""We were laughed at for making such a large computer,"" Huang said. ""It turns out, I did make a mistake -- I didn't make it large enough."" The successor, Xavier, has an 8-core custom CPU and Volta graphics (a total of nine billion transistors) but uses only 30W. Nvidia combines two of these with two discrete Volta GPUs on a board called Pegasus. Both Xavier and Pegasus are now sampling and will be in production by the end of the year. The next step will be to put the contents of the Pegasus board onto a smaller chipset, code-named Orin, though Nvidia gave no details on this product.
Nvidia's test vehicles already have 10 perception networks that collect and process data from sensors, and by the time the system is ready for commercial use, that number will probably grow to 20 to 30 networks. The company is working with 370 partners to develop these sensor systems. Each car collects petabytes of data and Nvidia's has a team of around 1,500 people that label around one million images per month, and all of this is fed into its Perception Infrastructure to train the autonomous systems. ""Data is the new source code,"" he said.

Even this is not enough though. It takes 20 cars driving all year long to cover one million miles, but it will take billions of miles to cover all the possible scenarios required to make self-driving vehicles safe. Nvidia Constellation system runs a virtual reality driving simulator on the same Drive architecture (Xavier and Pegasus) to augment road tests. Huang said 10,000 of these Constellation systems can ""test drive"" three billion miles per year. Finally, Nvidia announced that its Isaac developer kit and Jetson board for robotics is now available, and showed a demonstration of using its Holodeck VR environment to remotely drive a car located in the parking lot outside the convention center
This year's GTC keynote was also notable for what it did not include. The company did not announce a truly new GPU, and unlike in previous years, it did not even show a roadmap for future consumer or professional GPUs. Instead Nvidia said that it was doubling the memory in the current Volta V100 to 32GB because neural networks are getting larger. Huang also admitted that the popular Titan V remains out of stock but said Nvidia was working to increase the supply.
One likely reason is the lack of a compelling new process. The 10nm process is what the industry refers to as a short-lived node -- some foundries and customers skipped it altogether -- and 7nm isn't ready to go and its benefits without next-generation EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography are unclear. Instead, Nvidia has resorted to changes to the architecture, packaging, systems (stacks of high-bandwidth memory, faster interconnects and switches), and software -- a trend that is taking place throughout the industry as Moore's Law slows down. One thing that seems clear, though, is that regardless of where it comes from, the demand for bigger and faster systems remains insatiable for now.

Google announced on Wednesday the new Wear OS preview is now available to developers for testing on wearable devices. The Wear OS developer preview includes Android P platform features, alongside a new dark mode to enhance glanceability for the notifications stream and system launcher.
 	Included in the new Wear OS preview are battery saving features for Android wearables. Google detailed in a blog post:
 	Google is now rolling out the developer preview to the Huawei Watch 2 Bluetooth or Huawei Watch 2 Classic Bluetooth. It notes the preview isn't intended for daily or customer use -- only developers. The update is available via manual update or flash.
 	Earlier this month, Google rebranded Android Wear to Wear OS. At the time, Google also promised new features and updates ""in the coming weeks and months."" Makes sense -- Google's developer conference is in May where it will probably share a lot more on its wearable plans.

Researchers say the malware is ""highly efficient,"" even if it's not very sophisticated.

A newly-discovered keylogger malware has been found infecting computers in the wild. Though the malware is far from advanced, it's efficient at stealing passwords.
Researchers at Cybereason, a Boston, Mass.-based security firm, call the malware ""Fauxpersky,"" as it impersonates the Russian antivirus software Kaspersky. The keylogger is built off a popular app, AutoHotKey, which lets users write small scripts for automating tasks, and compile the script into an executable file. In this case, the app was abused to build a keylogger, which spreads through USB drives and infects Windows PCs -- and replicates on the computer's listed drives.
""This malware is by no means advanced or even very stealthy,"" said researchers Amit Serper and Chris Black, in a detailed blog post, published Wednesday. 
""However, this malware is highly efficient at infecting USB drives and exfiltrating data from the keylogger through Google directly to the attacker's mailbox,"" the researchers said.
That's where the malware's functionality gets interesting: Once the malware's core files are all running, everything typed on the computer is recorded into a text file with the window's name -- giving the malware author a better idea of the context to the keylogged text.
The contents of that text file is exfiltrated from the computer through a Google Form. The file is then deleted from the disk. Each form response goes directly to the malware author's email inbox.
Serper and Black reported the malicious form to Google, which took it down within an hour.
When contacted, Google -- which may have insight into who built the form -- did not comment. (If that changes, we'll update.)
The write-up described how the malware author ""didn't put any effort"" into making the malware look authentic, like changing the executable's icon from the AutoHotKey default, and built an unconvincing Kaspersky-style splash screen. When Fauxpersky spreads, it also sticks and maintains persistence, so that it runs when Windows is booted up. The malware simply creates a shortcut to itself in the Start menu's ""startup"" directory.
Cybereason didn't say how many machines were infected, but given that the malware spreads through an antiquated method of sharing USB drives, it's likely not to be widespread.

 Video: How Cambridge Analytica hoarded voters' data
 	 	 	 	Facebook knows a lot about you. And so do the third-party app makers and partners in the social network's ecosystem.


                        Facebook prying: Watchdogs hit back on excessive harvesting of your data
                    

Amid concerns over Facebook's use of tracking users with pixels, Belgium joins the Netherlands, France, and EC in legal moves.

 	This month, a whistleblower  	revealed data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested private data from 50 million Facebook profiles to understand voter behavior amidst the 2016 US Presidential election.
 	 	 	 	Facebook user data was accessed -- without explicit user permission -- by Cambridge Analytica to help Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. It was collected by a stealthy personality prediction Facebook app called ""thisisyourdigitallife."" Personal data accessed from Facebook users included profile names, locations, and information on their friends and the content they liked.

 Facebook apps can bleed your information without you knowing. In wake of the scandal, it's important to know which apps have access to your personal data and make the appropriate privacy changes to your account. Facebook has rolled out new settings to appease users after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Here's what you need to know.
 	 	 	 	Facebook's App Settings page is one of the social network's most important privacy destinations.
 	 	 	 	App Settings displays Facebook apps that are connected to your Facebook account. Here, you can see what data you provide apps and disable sharing select info. You can also remove the app completely from your Facebook account. Yes, even the FarmVille app you downloaded three years ago.
Adjust Facebook app settings for more privacy control.
 	 	 	 	To access Facebook's App Settings:
 	 	 	 	It's probably wise to unlink any Facebook apps from your account you no longer use. Remember, Cambridge Analytica's app was legitimate on the surface. Apps have access to your friend list and any information your friends choose to make public -- don't be fooled.
 	 	 	 	Facebook  	described its app platform as such:
 	 	 	 	Facebook's App Settings also lets users control app visibility, so you can adjust if your friends can see if you use an app or not.
 	 	 	 	Instead of cherry picking and disabling Facebook apps, you can completely disable the Facebook app platform. This means you won't be able to use Facebook integrations on third party apps or websites who access data through OAuth. Theoretically, you won't be sharing as much data with prying eyes.
 	 	 	 	 ""If you don't want apps and websites to access other categories of information (like your friend list, gender or info you've made public), you can turn off all Platform apps. But remember, you will not be able to use any games or apps yourself,"" Facebook writes in a support document.
 	 	 	 	You can turn Platform off by going to App Settings, then edit Apps, Websites and Plugins.
 	 	 	 	When you disable Facebook's app platform:
 	 	 	 	You can also disable those annoying Game and App notifications from your friends under App Settings.
 	 	To  	control Facebook data your friends can see about you, and thus share with third-party apps, simply do the following:
 	A new setting Facebook rolled out, called Access Your Information, lets users access and delete their posts, reactions, comments, and searches from their timeline or profile. It's an effort by Facebook to give users more control over what's posted on the social network.
 	Facebook said the new setting was already in the works before the Cambridge Analytica scandal. ""You can download a secure copy and even move it to another service,"" Facebook said.
 	While Facebook previously allowed users to download data and information uploaded, a new option sorts the download into several categories including posts, photos and videos, messages, groups, following, followers, and more.
 	Also new from Facebook is a Privacy Shortcuts menu to give users easier access to data controls.
Comparison of the old settings menu (left) and new settings menu (right).
 	Here, you can make your account more secure with settings like two-factor authentication, control personal information, control advertisement information, profile privacy, and more.
 	 	 	 	Facebook's Security and Login settings page shows you the location where your Facebook account is logged in and from which device. It also allows users to change their password, log in with a profile picture instead of password, enable/disable two factor authentication, encrypted email notifications, and more.
 	 	 	 	The Privacy settings page shows who can see your Facebook profile information, including posts you've made or you're tagged in, friend requests, friends list, email, phone number, and search engine enable/disable.
 	 	 	 	You can also check Facebook mobile app permission details including storage access, camera, whether the microphone can record audio or not, phone status, approximate location (network-based), and your precise location (GPS and network-based).
 	 	 	 	Lastly, it's important to remember to clear your web browser cookies. This will allow you to send less data to Facebook to use in advertisements on yourself.
 	In a blog post, Facebook said it has more privacy changes planned to rollout in the coming weeks:
 	We'll be tracking the latest.

Microsoft has posted a list of some of the featured sessions happening at its Build 2018 developer conference in mid-May.
The first couple dozen session descriptions went live today, March 28 (thanks to OnMSFT.com for the pointer). The conference is set to include 350 technical sessions, according to the Build 2018 site. Microsoft officials previously said to expect the show to cover AI, mixed reality, IoT and all things cloud, along with the more traditional Windows and cross-platform content.
There aren't many surprises in the initial list, with big data, IoT, blockchain, Azure, containers and Visual Studio all mentioned in the  just-published descriptions. Microsoft also has listed a session that will cover Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), entitled ""Building performant, offline-capable web apps,"" as well as one on the evolution of its Fluent design system. Microsoft is adding support for PWAs to Windows 10 with Redstone 4.
The first group of public sessions is very database heavy, with Azure SQL Database, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgresQL and Cosmos DB all figuring prominently. In some ways, this shouldn't be too surprising, given the company's strategy to link all of its products and services in some way to AI (and AI relies on lots of data). 
Some of my contacts are quite interested in what Microsoft says (and doesn't) at Build regarding the future of XAML Standard. Microsoft's work on this -- at least publicly -- has ground to a standstill in recent months. The creation of XAML Standard, which is an effort to unify XAML across the Universal Windows Platform and Xamarin Forms, was a big topic at last year's Build.  There have been hints that we'll hear more on that front at the show.
Build 2018 is happening May 7 to 9 in downtown Seattle. It overlaps with the Google I/O developer conference. Microsoft is planning only one major keynote, on day one, at the event. Among the keynote speakers listed on the Build site are CEO Satya Nadella; Executive VP for Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie; Executive VP for Windows and Devices Terry Myerson; and Executive VP of AI and Research Harry Shum.
Microsoft opened registration for Build in February and the event still hasn't sold out, as far as we've heard. (Some speculate this is because Microsoft's perpetually broken registration system was fixed this year; others claim Microsoft has increased the available attendance number significantly.)

 	Adobe and Nvidia have announced a partnership that will see both companies deliver new artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning services for Adobe Creative.
 	Making the announcement during the Adobe Summit keynote in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Adobe CEO and president Shantanu Narayen was joined by Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang.


                        AI and the Future of Business
                    

Machine learning, task automation and robotics are already widely used in business. These and other AI technologies are about to multiply, and we look at how organizations can best take advantage of them.

 	The CEOs said the partnership will see both companies work to optimise the Adobe Sensei AI and machine learning framework for Nvidia GPUs.
 	It is expected that the new announcement will help Adobe extend the availability of Sensei APIs and to broaden the Sensei offering to a new audience of developers, data scientists, and partners.
 	""Combining Nvidia's best-in-class AI capabilities with Adobe's leading creative and digital experience solutions, all powered by Sensei, will allow us to deliver higher-performing AI services to customers and developers more quickly,"" Narayen said.
 	""We're excited to partner with Nvidia to push the boundaries of what's possible in creativity, marketing, and exciting new areas like immersive media.""
 	Built into the Adobe Cloud Platform, Sensei is a framework and set of intelligent services aimed at improving the design and delivery of digital experiences.
 	""AI is the ultimate assistant -- delighting artists with magical capabilities to further their creativity, and helping businesses of every kind to gain insights and efficiencies,"" Huang explained. 
""Our work with Adobe brings AI within reach for millions of individuals working in the creative and marketing fields, providing them with tools offering performance that was unimaginable just a short time ago.""
 	Adobe and Nvidia have been partners for over a decade on enabling GPU acceleration for the former's creative and digital experience products, including for Sensei-powered features, such as auto lip sync in Adobe Character Animator CC and face aware editing in Photoshop CC, as well as cloud-based AI/machine learning products and features, such as image analysis for Adobe Stock and Lightroom CC, and auto-tagging in Adobe Experience Manager.
 	The companies also plan to work on optimising Sensei AI services for Nvidia hardware in the cloud and at the edge. 
Additionally, the CEOs said they plan to explore packaging and delivering Sensei AI services to Nvidia's developer ecosystem, including services targeted at creative mediums, such as mixed reality and ""next-generation"" rendering such as Nvidia's new  	RTX real-time ray-tracing technology.

In this age of instant communication, there is pressure on employees to be ""switched on"" all hours of the day. But do we really have the mental attitude to totally disconnect from work?

Video: Could telework help your career? Survey finds mixed results
 	If you live and work France, you can forget work after 6pm.
 	In a series of  measures designed to protect employees from dreaded after-work calls or emails, France's government passed a new law last year establishing workers' the ""right to  disconnect"" when they leave the office, as well as ensuring they are fairly paid  for the work that they do.
 	In Brazil,  workers can ask for overtime if they have to answer emails outside of  working hours. 
 But do other countries in the world have a relentless work  ethic  that keeps them tied to the office, or are they happy to let their  workers enjoy their lesiure time?
 	A new study by UK-based HandsetExpert  has revealed that almost two  out of three tech workers would ignore an out-of-hours call from the boss. It  surveyed 1,850 mobile device users in the UK to find out how we deal with the  pressures of being an ""always-on"" society.
This number might be the roll-up of various  reasons -- from being on the toilet, in the bath, or in other compromising  situations.

The survey showed different behaviours from different job roles. Healthcare professionals seem to be most connected to their place of work. They were the least likely to cancel any calls from their boss, with only 42.5  percent stating they would not pick up the call.
 	At the other end of the scale, real estate agents -- who already work some of  the longest hours in the industry -- are least likely to respond. Almost  three out of four workers (72.6 percent) in that industry sector would not respond to calls  from their boss.
 	We do seem to have a relentless work ethic, but expectations of  around-the-clock availability from employers can result in employee dissatisfaction and low morale.
 	 HandsetExpert founder Shahrum Gilani said, ""Employers must take note of the  fine line that separates an employee's work and personal time and discuss what  will and won't work with staff from the outset.
Gilani added: ""If employees feel cared for and  respected, this will likely reflect in the quality of their work and willingness  to pick up an out-of-hours call here and there if they believe it is  important.""
 	Perhaps managers should stop to think before sending that late-night  message, and workers should stop surrendering to the pressure or requirement to  answer and enjoy their limited time off.
 What  features does the smartphone of the future need?
 	Smartphone sales have plateaued now that everyone has a mobile device. So, what is next for mobile phone makers and service providers in the post-app, post-smartphone era?
 Future  mobile tech needs these features to work seamlessly
 
 	Our wish list for the mobile device of the future -- to keep us connected -- whatever happens.

VMware said on Wednesday that it's acquiring E8 Security, a user and entity behavior analytics company. 
E8 Security's platform uses machine learning and AI to help businesses detect cyber threats faster. It can surface anomalies and suspicious behaviors, discover malicious activity, and correlate data from different sources.
VMware plans to integrate E8's technology into its Workspace ONE platform to give users more insight into the security posture of their digital workspace and provide advanced threat detection and response, the company said. 
""E8 Security's ability to analyze behavior has the opportunity to enhance the inherent security capabilities built on Workspace ONE to make security operations more proactive,"" wrote Sumit Dhawan, SVP of desktop products and solutions for VMware, in a blog post. ""our customers will be able to streamline management, remediation, and automation to improve the employee experience and the security of their digital workspace.""
Like other tech vendors, VMware often turns to acquisitions to supplement its internal development efforts. Its last acquisition on the security front was in May of last year when it bought Apteligent, makers of application performance software.
""We plan to continue to invest in internal innovation efforts to build out intelligence-driven capabilities while also exploring opportunities to augment with acquired technologies and talent where needed,"" noted Shekar Ayyar, EVP of strategy and corporate development for VMware.

Amid the ongoing trust crisis, Facebook users get an easier way to download their data and new mobile privacy settings.

Video -- Data caper: How Cambridge Analytica hoarded voters' personal details
 Facebook has announced new controls, privacy shortcuts, and tools to delete Facebook data but said these were in the works before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded.
 The new privacy changes are designed to offer users more control over their data and come amid continued outrage over Facebook's handling of user privacy, which has already sparked an FTC investigation into whether the social media company breached a 2011 privacy-related settlement. 
 The new settings and privacy controls also arrive just ahead of Europe's new data-protection laws, known as GDPR, which come into effect in May.
 As part of the update, Facebook has released a new feature called Access Your Information, a new ""secure way"" for users to access and delete their posts, reactions, comments, and searches from their timeline or profile.
 Facebook's crisis has caused many users to explore the 'download your data' feature from the company. 
Download now: EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance checklist
 The current option downloads all a user's data, whereas a new option breaks up the download into several categories each with bold icons, such as posts, photos and videos, messages, groups, following, and followers and so on. 
 The existing download option has 72 categories of information, from addresses and apps to IP addresses, political views, work, and videos.
 Facebook has also overhauled its settings menu on mobile devices in a way that should make it easier for users to find settings. The new page consolidates 20 separate screens down to a single page and ditched some outdated settings.
 It's also introducing a new privacy shortcuts menu that offers simpler ways to control data with clearer explanations of how the controls work. 
 Here users can activate two-factor authentication, select ad preferences, and review posts that have been shared or reacted to, as well as Facebook searches. It also has a shortcut for managing who can see posts and profile information.
Facebook shows what the new consolidated settings page looks like. 
 ""So in addition to Mark Zuckerberg's announcements last week -- cracking down on abuse of the Facebook platform, strengthening our policies, and making it easier for people to revoke apps' ability to use your data -- we're taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people more in control of their privacy,"" said Ashlie Beringer, VP and deputy general counsel.
 ""Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.""

CIOs simply can't afford to ignore the opportunities that citizen development offers.

 Video: The advent of the citizen developer


                        Riding the DevOps Revolution
                    

A DevOps approach allows IT to deliver applications faster than ever and avoid silos that can slow down big companies. We explore how to integrate this model to maximum effect.

 	 	 	IT leaders are navigating an unfamiliar world.
 	 	To really understand the truth of this, let's rewind to the middle of the 20th century. IT as a discrete corporate function was born in the 1950s, when companies realized they needed to protect their new investment in some very large, very expensive, and very complicated machinery: Computers.
 	 	 	As such, the IT department's entire job was to protect those  	machines and ensure they were used as efficiently and effectively as possible.
 	 	 	The result was a ""systems before people"" mentality. That mentality still lingers today among some IT teams -- but it's as unhelpful as it is outdated.
 	 	 	Today's IT department has a very different job. A  	recent survey revealed that IT leaders' top two challenges are ""innovating for the business"" and ""project speed."" Ultimately, the IT department is becoming the ""central nervous system"" of the organization, tasked with helping a company measure up to customer demands to become more productive, more innovative, and more agile.
Figure 1. Skill gaps are a major IT challenge 
   That same survey showed that 67 percent of IT teams are making it a high priority to improve collaboration with other lines of business. I take that as proof that the ""systems before people"" mentality is dying.
Figure 2. New IT hires from universities lack the skills necessary to contribute immediately 
   Despite stepping into this role of increased prominence in the business, IT leaders find themselves in a thorny situation.  Only 29 percent of IT organizations rate their ability to keep pace with technology trends as excellent. The World Economic Forum has found that over a third of the core skills required of the workforce by 2020 will be different from those today. In IT -- at the forefront of tech's impact on business -- the challenge is particularly pronounced, with a majority of IT leaders (52 percent) saying that skill gaps are a major challenge at their organization.
   As  Jonathan Reichental, CIO of the city of Palo Alto, said: ""Years ago, you could build a workforce of talent over a couple of decades. Now, these technologies emerge within three or four years, and we can't make the shift in educating people quickly enough. And here's the kicker: This isn't getting any easier. This is going to get more complex.""
   So, where is the enterprising IT  leader to turn? Enter citizen development.
   Citizen development can be explained as the  flipside to the spooky-sounding ""shadow IT"", where business users, hungry to solve problems, quickly built their own solutions in isolation from the core IT department.


                        The advent of the citizen developer
                    

Software development can be carried out by almost anyone with only a little technical know-how.

Read More

   Citizen development brings those progress-hungry business users back into the fold, empowering them with the skills and resources (like low-code  development tools) to solve their problems right alongside -- and in concert with -- the existing IT department.
   New  Salesforce research suggests that 74 percent of IT leaders plan to shift at least some of their application development directly to business units. The IDC found that by 2027, the number of active citizen developers will double to 10m, and those citizen developers will write 60 percent of all new applications.
   IT leaders are flocking to citizen developers now because it helps solve some of key challenges they face today. By empowering a greater proportion of the workforce to do development, IT leaders can turn a team of 15 into hundreds of quasi-developers.
   What's more, those quasi-developers are business experts, not IT experts. That means they can effectively  focus on solving the key challenges that will give the highest output or efficiency gains for the team -- because they're often part of the team that will use the tool.
   As we give development tools to a broader swathe of the workforce, we can start to tap into ideas and enthusiasm from a different  group with different perspectives on the challenges IT developers are wrestling with.
 Damian O'Farrill, himself a citizen developer at Autodesk, put it well: ""As citizen developers, we have a certain naivete that plays to our advantage. We don't know what we don't know -- but we know enough to be dangerous ... Let's use this cross-functional expertise that we have and not just think in terms of system. That naivete of someone that has not come through the traditional developer learning -- it opens up possibilities of much more innovation.""
   By empowering business users with some development tools, key development expertise can be freed up to work on more challenging and complex tasks. Implemented well, highly trained development experts will no longer have to spend their time working on routine tasks.
 David Riggan, Area Vice President for Solution Delivery at BMC, said: ""The analogy is that of the highly skilled craftsman. You don't necessarily want them sitting there carving out block stones for a building. That's not a good use of their time or the value that they can add. So if you can teach someone else how to do those simpler tasks, then the craftsman can work on the architecture of the building ... It's the same thing for me from a development standpoint, right?""
Figure 3. IT Leaders Who Are Extremely or Very Interested in Low-Code Development 
   For those of you now wondering how to  leverage the power of citizen development in your business, some key advice:
   It's not an easy time to be an IT leader. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has drastically elevated customer expectations and shifted the fundamental remit of the IT department. The department  faces demands to enable business agility, and ever-higher levels of innovation and productivity -- all while juggling shrinking budgets and legacy mindsets of IT as a control function, not a strategic one.
   Yet, by shifting that mindset -- to one where they  empower business users to solve their own IT problems -- they free up precious developer resources to tackle major opportunities. They introduce new, innovative voices into the debate on IT issues. And they drastically increase the IT capacity and competence for their entire organization. In this Fourth Industrial Revolution, CIOs simply can't afford to ignore the opportunities that citizen development offers.

Walmart is bringing its partnership with JD.com into its grocery business.
The Chinese physical store will stock products that customers can also buy through its Walmart  virtual storefront on the Chinese electronic marketplace, JD.com, according to a report in Reuters.
Walmart first partnered with JD.com two years ago as both companies struggled to overcome the retail dominance of Alibaba, China’s e-commerce juggernaut.
Throwing the ouroboros of 21st-century economics into sharp relief, the partnership was established in 2016 to sell Walmart’s China-made, U.S.-branded products to Chinese consumers through JD.com’s  online marketplace and by setting up electronics showrooms hawking JD.com’s tech wares in Walmart locations throughout China.
Now the integration of JD.com’s online and Walmart’s offline supply chains will extend to groceries. Beginning with a store in China’s southern megacity, Shenzhen  — 8,000 items ranging from fresh fruit to seafood will not only be stocked in stores, but also will be available for online orders through JD.com.
Customers in a three-kilometer radius from the store will get their food delivered within 30 minutes — and will be able to use a new shopping application available through WeChat to skip checkout counters. 
The new stores step up the competition for convenience that’s now top of mind for big retailers, from Amazon  and Alibaba to Target and Walmart.

The Model 3 now has a new way to control Autopilot. The company recently sent out an update that moved the controls from the center infotainment stack to the steering wheeling. Previously, drivers had to use the large screen to change Autopilot’s  speed and cruise distance and in doing so, required drivers to take their eyes off the road to change these options.
The Model 3 is an exercise in minimalism, and to that end, the company is seemingly still working out the best interface. To that end, the controls on the Model 3’s steering wheel were purposely not labeled or dedicated to a specific function and instead change depending on the car’s role.

Thanks to the 2018.12 update, the right-hand scroll wheel controls the speed of the vehicle while the buttons flanking that wheel changes the follow distance. The new controls do not replace the existing controls but rather supplement them.
During our review of the Model 3, we noted the sparse cockpit design and found it good and bad. On the one hand, it’s terrific to have an unobstructed view of the road – it’s as pure as driving experience as rolling down the track in the soapbox derby car of your youth, and it leaves you feeling connected to the road itself. But yet the car feels too reliant on the center touchscreen, which often requires drivers to look away from the road for simple commands.
Tesla  is operating under increasing scrutiny following a fatal accident that involved Autopilot. Updates like this show the company is at least listening to owners and updating its vehicles in kind.", technology

YouTube  today is introducing a new way for advertisers to maximize reach from their shorter ads. The change arrives around two years after YouTube’s introduction of the six-second bumper, which the company says advertisers have learned how to best use to raise brand awareness, despite having only a few seconds to tell their story. Now, advertisers will have the benefit of building bumper-like or longer ads to gain broader reach, while still allowing the ads to be skipped after 5 seconds like all TrueView ads.
With the existing TrueView in-stream ads, which air before or during a video, advertisers only pay when the viewer watches at least 30 seconds or to the end of the video, or they take action by clicking on a card or other elements of the creative to learn more.
TrueView for Reach is meant to combine the best of two worlds – short-form bumper ads, and the user choice offered through the TrueView in-stream format.
The company says the addition will expand advertisers’ options with TrueView ads. Depending on campaign objectives, advertisers can opt for TrueView for Views (standard) ads, TrueView for Action, or TrueView for Reach – all of which are skippable after 5 seconds.
“TrueView for reach brings our popular in-stream format built on user choice together with the simplicity of CPM buying,” says YouTube, in an announcement. “Optimized for efficient reach, this format can help you to raise awareness among a broad set of customers — and do so within our 95% viewable and 95% audible environment.”
The company says that during beta testing the format across 84 campaigns, 9 out of 10 drove a significant lift in ad recall, with average lift of nearly 20 percent.
Samsung Electronics America said it was able to reach 50+ percent more people at half the CPM with TrueView for Reach, when it tested the format, while Pepsi France said that format helped deliver high reach, but also high completion rates for its 10-second video.
“Moreover, CPMs proved to be more competitive: we saw 30% lower CPMs on average compared to previous campaigns. This ultimately drove lower average costs on incremental reach points: -46% versus TV on specific target audiences,” explained Vanessa Tsangaratos, Digital Marketing Manager at Pepsi France.
The expansion of ad format options for YouTube is becoming even more critical to brands and advertisers, given the continued rise in cord cutting and adoption of subscription video on demand services, like Netflix, which are ad-free.
As YouTube notes in a blog post, advertising was simpler in the TV era – you’d just find the most popular shows, and place your brand there in the commercial breaks. Now advertisers are trying to find a place to gain attention for their brand in a far more complex landscape – there are video ads not only on streaming services like Hulu, but also on live TV services, on YouTube and even on social media, like Facebook and Instagram.
The goal is to now find a place to advertise where you can actually capture users’ attention.
YouTube claims it’s that place, of course. It cites a recent Ipsos study that found people are 3 times more likely to pay attention to online video ads compared with TV ads.
TrueView for reach is not the only TrueView option for YouTube advertisers. The newer TrueView for action is also available for those advertisers who want to customize a call-to-action that’s important to their business, like leads or referrals.", technology

Just in time to be too late for your 2017 taxes, Amazon’s added a new skill for Alexa that lets users donate with their voice. The command is pretty much as you’d expect — say, “Alexa, donate $20 to the American Cancer Society” and the smart assistant will pull that money from your associated account.
Alexa uses a four-digit voice confirmation code to help users from making accidental purchases — and so other people in your household don’t go around donating away your life savings. Not that that would be the worst thing to spend that money on, I guess. 
Amazon also says it shares users’ name, email and address with the organization, but not credit card info. Users will also get an email confirmation of the donation and can track that info over at Amazon Pay. 
The list is 40 charities long and can be found here. Users can also just say, “Alexa, make a donation,” and the assistant will help you select a name from the list. The action joins the site’s existing Amazon Pay offering, which the company says more than one million customers have used to make donations to charity. ", technology

Zuckerberg has been on a bit of a publicity tour following the Cambridge Analytica  scandal and a generally tough year for the social media behemoth.
This morning, an interview with Zuck was published on Vox’s The Ezra Klein Show. In it, the Facebook  CEO waded through some of the company’s most pressing issues, including how to deal with fake news and help support good journalism and how to deal with governing a community of 2 billion people. Zuck also clapped back at Tim Cook who has criticized Facebook’s model of generating revenue through advertising.
On the problem of Fake News and transparency in the past:
It’s tough to be transparent when we don’t first have a full understanding of where the state of some of the systems are. In 2016, we were behind having an understanding and operational excellence on preventing things like misinformation, Russian interference. And you can bet that that’s a huge focus for us going forward.
On how Facebook is trying to serve up content, including news content, that is meaningful to users:
The way that this works today, broadly, is we have panels of hundreds or thousands of people who come in and we show them all the content that their friends and pages who they follow have shared. And we ask them to rank it, and basically say, “What were the most meaningful things that you wish were at the top of feed?” And then we try to design algorithms that just map to what people are actually telling us is meaningful to them. Not what they click on, not what is going to make us the most revenue, but what people actually find meaningful and valuable. So when we’re making shifts — like the broadly trusted shift — the reason why we’re doing that is because it actually maps to what people are telling us they want at a deep level.
Zuck was also asked about supporting news organizations, as some slice of Facebook’s revenue comes from users consuming news on the platform:
For the larger institutions, and maybe even some of the smaller ones as well, subscriptions are really a key point on this. I think a lot of these business models are moving towards a higher percentage of subscriptions, where the people who are getting the most value from you are contributing a disproportionate amount to the revenue. And there are certainly a lot of things that we can do on Facebook to help people, to help these news organizations, drive subscriptions. And that’s certainly been a lot of the work that we’ve done and we’ll continue doing.
He also addressed that subscriptions might not work for local news, which the CEO believes are equally important:
In local news, I think some of the solutions might be a little bit different. But I think it’s easy to lose track of how important this is. There’s been a lot of conversation about civic engagement changing, and I think people can lose sight of how closely tied that can be to local news. In a town with a strong local newspaper, people are much more informed, they’re much more likely to be civically active. On Facebook we’ve taken steps to show more local news to people. We’re also working with them specifically, creating funds to support them and working on both subscriptions and ads there should hopefully create a more thriving ecosystem.
In an interview last week, the Apple CEO said that tech firms “are beyond” self-regulation. When asked what he would do if he was in Zuckerberg’s position, Cook said “I wouldn’t be in this situation.” The CEO has long held that an advertising model, in which companies use data around users to sell to brands, is not what Apple wants to become.
“They’re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it,” he said of Facebook and Google in 2015. “We think that’s wrong. And it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.”
Zuck was asked about Cook’s statements in the interview:
You know, I find that argument, that if you’re not paying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib. And not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.
That doesn’t mean that we’re not primarily focused on serving people. I think probably to the dissatisfaction of our sales team here, I make all of our decisions based on what’s going to matter to our community and focus much less on the advertising side of the business.
Zuck even took the opportunity to clap back at Cook a bit, saying we shouldn’t believe that companies trying to charge us more actually care about us.
But if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford. I thought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying on this in one of his Kindle launches a number of years back. He said, “There are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less.” And at Facebook, we are squarely in the camp of the companies that work hard to charge you less and provide a free service that everyone can use.
I don’t think at all that that means that we don’t care about people. To the contrary, I think it’s important that we don’t all get Stockholm Syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you. Because that sounds ridiculous to me.
Vox’s founder and Editor-at-Large Ezra Klein brought up something Zuck said in an earlier interview, that Facebook was more like a government than a traditional company. Zuck explained that disputes over what content is admissible on Facebook has grown to a scale that requires a certain level of governance.
But I think it’s actually one of the most interesting philosophical questions that we face. With a community of more than 2 billion people, all around the world, in every different country, where there are wildly different social and cultural norms, it’s just not clear to me that us sitting in an office here in California are best placed to always determine what the policies should be for people all around the world. And I’ve been working on and thinking through, how can you set up a more democratic or community-oriented process that reflects the values of people around the world?
That’s one of the things that I really think we need to get right. Because I’m just not sure that the current state is a great one.
On how Facebook could prepare for its own overwhelming scale:
One is transparency. Right now, I don’t think we are transparent enough around the prevalence of different issues on the platform. We haven’t done a good job of publishing and being transparent about the prevalence of those kind of issues, and the work that we’re doing and the trends of how we’re driving those things down over time.
And on long-term goals for governance:
But over the long-term, what I’d really like to get to is an independent appeal. So maybe folks at Facebook make the first decision based on the community standards that are outlined, and then people can get a second opinion. You can imagine some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don’t work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.

Po.et a startup that wants to put publishing permissions on the blockchain and build a marketplace on top of it, announced today that it was bringing on Eric Elliott as the VP of engineering.
Today’s announcement comes on the heels that the company had hired Jarrod Dicker as CEO in February. Dicker was previously vice president of innovation and commercial strategy at The Washington Post.
Elliott, who has written a book on Javascript, has a range of experience working for the likes of Adobe, Wall Street Journal and BBC. He also helped code BandPage, a startup that was sold to YouTube in 2016. He sees this company as a way to move publishing away from a traditional gatekeeper-driven system to one based on purely on value on the blockchain.
“Po.et  represents the chance to liberate creatives from traditional gatekeepers: to more directly connect with revenue sources to enable them to earn money doing what they love to do. It also represents a chance to make it easier for companies to find the resources they’re looking for, and obtain legal license to use the content with the click of a button,” Elliott wrote in a blog post announcing his new position.
Dicker says Elliott’s credentials speak for themselves. “Eric has scaled multiple engineering teams to tens of millions of users and helped build Adobe Creative Cloud, enabling the successful transition from boxed software to the SaaS model,” he told TechCrunch.
“The big thing [about this announcement] is that we’re growing our engineering core. A lot of blockchain companies are not shipping and delivering in the space yet and not only are we doing so, we’re bringing in a seasoned engineer who has a history of releasing products to help scale the team,” he added.
Po.et has a broad vision to transform publishing to a place where publications, authors and creatives can set permissions for their content and monetize it as they see fit in a kind of electronic marketplace of ideas. All of this is to be built on top of the blockchain. the electronic ledger best known as the record keeping system for bitcoin.
The ledger technology, which allows you to track bitcoin transactions in an immutable, irrefutable record that can also be applied to a number of scenarios for tracking virtually anything of value including content.
Today’s announcement is a sign that the startup is starting to mature, and building an executive team to carry the company’s vision to the next phase. To date, Po.et has raised a mix of traditional venture capital and token sales.They started with a million dollar seed round last June, then raised another $10 M through an ICO in August, according to the roadmap on the company’s website.", technology

With the race to next-generation silicon in full swing, the waterfall of venture money flowing into custom silicon startups is already showing an enormous amount of potential for some more flexible hardware for an increasingly changing technology landscape — and Naveed Sherwani hopes to tap that for everyone else.
That’s the premise of SiFive, a startup that’s designed to help entrepreneurs — or any company — come up with a custom designed chip for their needs. But rather than having to raise tens of millions of dollars from a venture firm or have a massive production system in place, SiFive’s goal is to help get that piece of silicon in the hands of the developer quickly so they can see if it actually works based off a set of basic hardware and IP offered, and then figure out when and how to move it into full-scale production. The company starts by offering templates and then allows them to make some modifications for what eventually ends up as a piece of RISC-V silicon that’s in their hands. SiFive today said it has raised $50.6 million in venture financing in a round led by Sutter Hill Ventures, Spark Capital, and Osage University Partners.
“The way we view it, is that we think we should not depend on people learning special languages and things of that nature to be able to modify the architecture and enhance the architecture,” Sherwani said. “What we believe is there could be a high-level interface, which is what we’re building, which will allow people to take existing cores, bring them into their design space, and then apply a configuration. Moving those configurations, you can modify the core, and then you can get the new modified core. That’s the approach we take, we don’t have to learn a special language or be an expert, it’s the way we present the core. We’d like to start with cores that are verified, and each of these modifications does not cause to become non-verifiable.”
SiFive is based on a design framework for silicon called RISC-V. You could consider it a kind of open source analog to designs by major chip fab firms, but the goal for RISC-V chips is to lean on the decades of experience since the original piece of silicon came out of Intel to develop something that is less messy while still getting the right tasks done. Sherwani says that RISC-V chips have more than 50 instruction sets while common chips will have more than 1,000. By nature, they aren’t at the kind of scale of an Intel, so the kinds of efficiencies those firms might have don’t exist. But SiFive hopes to serve a wide array of varying needs rather than mass-producing a single style of silicon.
There are two flows for developers looking to build out silicon using SiFive. First is the prototype flow, where developers will get a chance to spec out their silicon and figure out their specific needs. The goal there is to get something into the hands of the developer they can use to showcase their ideas or technology, and SiFive works with IP vendors and other supply chain partners — during this time, developers aren’t paying for IP. Once the case is proved out (and the startup has, perhaps, raised money based on that idea) they can switch to a production flow with SiFive where they will start paying for IP and services. There’s also a potential marketplace element as more and more people come up with novel ideas for operational cores.
“For any segment in the market there will be a few templates available,” Sherwani said. “We’ll have some tools and methodologies there, and among all the various templates are available show what would be the best for [that customer]. We also have an app store — we are expecting people who have designed cores who are willing to share it, because they don’t need it to be proprietary. If anyone uses that template, then whatever price they can put on it, they can make some money doing that. This whole idea of marketplaces will get more people excited.”
As there is an intense rush to develop new customized silicon, it may be that services like the ones offered by SiFive become more and more necessary. But there’s another element to the bet behind SiFive: making the chip itself less ambiguous and trying to remove black boxes. That doesn’t necessarily make it wildly more secure than the one next to it, but at the very least, it means when there is a major security flaw like Intel’s Spectre problems, there may be a bit more tolerance from the developer community because there are fewer black boxes.
“All these complications are there and unless you have all this expertise, you can’t do a chip,” Sherwani said. “Our vision is that we deliver the entire chip experience to that platform and people can be able to log in. They don’t need a team, any tools, they don’t need FPGAs because all those will be available on the web. As a result the cost goes down because it’s a shared economy, they’re sharing tools, and that is how we think dramatically you can do chips at much lower cost.”
While there is a lot of venture money flowing into the AI chip space — with many different interpretations of what that hardware looks like — Sherwani said the benefit of working with SiFive is to be able to rapidly adapt an idea to a changing algorithm. Developers have already proven out a lot of different tools and frameworks, but once a piece of silicon is in production it’s not easy to change on the fly. Should those best practices or algorithms change, developers will have an opportunity to reassess and redesign the chip as quickly as possible.
The idea of that custom silicon is going to be a big theme going forward as more and more use cases emerge that could be easier with a customized piece of hardware. Already there are startups like Mythic  and SambaNova Systems, which have raised tens of millions of dollars and specialize in the rapid-fire calculations for typical AI processes. But this kind of technology is now showing up in devices ranging from an autonomous vehicle to a fridge, and each use case may carry different needs. Intel and other chip design firms probably can’t hit every niche, and the one-size-fits-all (or even something more modular like an FPGA from Intel) might not hit each sweet spot. That, in theory, is the hole that a company like SiFive could fill.", technology

A couple of years ago, Dropbox shocked a lot of people when it decided to mostly drop the public cloud, and built its own datacenters. More recently, Atlassian did the opposite, closing most of its datacenters and moving to the cloud. Companies make these choices for a variety of reasons. When Atlassian  CTO Sri Viswanath came on board in 2016, he made the decision to move the company’s biggest applications to AWS.
In part, this is a story of technical debt — that’s the concept that over time your applications become encumbered by layers of crusty code, making it harder to update and ever harder to maintain. For Atlassian, which was founded in 2002, that bill came due in 2016 when Viswanath came to work for the company.
Atlassian already knew they needed to update the code to move into the future. One of the reasons they brought Viswanath on board was to lead that charge, but the thinking was already in place even before he got there. A small team was formed back in 2015 to work out the vision and the architecture for the new cloud-based approach, but they wanted to have their first CTO in place to carry it through to fruition.
He put the plan into motion, giving it the internal code name Vertigo — maybe because the thought of moving most of their software stack to the public cloud made the engineering team dizzy to even consider. The goal of the project was to rearchitect the software, starting with their biggest products Jira and Confluence, in a such a way that it would lay the foundation for the company for the next decade — no pressure or anything.
Photo: WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images
They spent a good part of 2016 rewriting the software and getting it set up on AWS. They concentrated on turning their 15-year old code into microservices, which in the end resulted in a smaller code base. He said the technical debt issues were very real, but they had to be careful not to reinvent the wheel, just change what needed to be changed whenever possible.
“The code base was pretty large and we had to go in and do two things. We wanted to build it for multi-tenant architecture and we wanted to create microservices,” he said. “If there was a service that could be pulled out and made self-contained we did that, but we also created new services as part of the process.”
Last year was the migration year, and it was indeed a full year-long project to migrate every last customer over to the new system. It started in January and ended in December and involved moving tens of thousands of customers.
Photo: KTSDesign/Science Photo Library
First of all, they automated whatever they could and they also were very deliberate in terms of the migration order, being conscious of migrations that might be more difficult. “We were thoughtful in what order to migrate. We didn’t want to do easiest first and hardest at the end. We didn’t want to do just the harder ones and not make progress. We had to blend [our approaches] to fix bugs and issues throughout the project,” he said.
Viswanath stated that the overarching goal was to move the customers without a major incident. “If you talk to anyone who does migration, that’s a big thing. Everyone has scars doing migrations. We were conscious to do this pretty carefully.” Surprisingly, although it wasn’t perfect, they did manage to complete the entire exercise without a major outage, a point of which the team is justifiably proud. That doesn’t mean that it was always smooth or easy.
“It sounds super easy: ‘we were thoughtful and we migrated,’ but there was warfare every day. When you migrate, you hit a wall and react. It was a daily thing for us throughout the year,” he explained. It took a total team effort involving engineering, product and support. That included having a customer support person involved in the daily scrum meetings so they could get a feel for any issues customers were having and fix them as quickly as possible.
As in any cloud project, there are some general benefits to moving an application to the cloud around flexibility, agility and resource elasticity, but there was more than that when it came to this specific project.
Photo: Ade Akinrujomu/Getty Images
First of all it has allowed faster deployment with multiple deployments at the same time, due in large part to the copious use of microservices. That means they can add new features much faster. During the migration year, they held off on new features for the most part because they wanted to keep things as static as possible for the shift over, but with the new system in place they can move much more quickly to add new features.
They get much better performance and if they hit a performance bottleneck, they can just add more resources because it’s the cloud. What’s more, they were able to have a local presence in the EU and that improves performance by having the applications closer to the end users located there.
Finally, they actually found the cloud to be a more economical option, something that not every company that moves to the cloud finds. By closing the datacenters and reducing the capital costs associated with buying hardware and hiring IT personnel to maintain it, they were able to reduce costs.
It was a long drawn out project, and as such, they really needed to think about the human aspect of it too. They would swap people in and out to make sure the engineers stayed fresh and didn’t burn out helping with the transition.
One thing that helped was the company culture in general, which Viswanath candidly describes as one with open communication and a general “no bullshit” policy. “We maintained open communication, even when things weren’t going well. People would raise their hand if they couldn’t keep up and we would get them help,” he said.
He admitted that there was some anxiety within the company and for him personally implementing a project of this scale, but they knew they needed to do it for the future of the organization. “There was definitely nervousness on what if this project doesn’t go well. It seemed the obvious right direction and we had to do it. The risk was what if we screwed up in execution and we didn’t realize benefits we set out to do.”
In the end, it was a lot of work, but it worked out just fine and they have the system in place for the future. “Now we are set up for the next 10 years,” he said.", technology

After it took James Tsuei a month of research and emails to plan a dive in Indonesia, he decided it was time for his startup, Deepblu, to launch a booking platform for divers. Planet Deepblu bills itself as “the Airbnb for diving” and is the latest piece of the diving ecosystem the Taipei-based startup is building.
Based in Taipei and backed by Silverlink Capital, Deepblu was founded in 2015 to bring resources for divers into the mobile, cloud-based era. Its products included a Bluetooth-enabled dive computer called COSMIQ and a social network where users share dive logs. Dive computers are small devices, often worn like wristwatches, that let divers track and calculate important information, such as when they need to take a decompression stop. COSMIQ automates a lot of the process and enables divers to wirelessly sync dive logs to Deepblu’s social network, which the startup claims now has more than 40,000 members, 500 dive shops and 300,000 dive logs.
Deepblu drew on its community for Planet Deepblu, integrating their dive logs, reviews, videos and photos to help users plan diving trips. There are already several dive booking sites out there, but Tsuei, Deepblu’s co-founder and chief executive officer, says they operate more like Agoda or Booking.com, while Planet Deepblu’s Airbnb-like approach means divers can use it to communicate directly with dive operators instead of relying on agencies.
Tsuei claims this can save them up to 25% on the total cost of a trip. By serving as a centralized database for dive planning, Planet Deepblu also wants to save its users time.
Part of Deepblu’s mission is to give scuba diving the same visibility and cultural prominence as golfing by making it more accessible to beginners as well as advanced divers. Though it’s a niche market, diving has a lot of financial potential. Tsuei says there are currently about 6 to 8 million active divers, or people who make three or more diving sessions each year, and dive trips are big investments. Divers spend an average of $1,000 on equipment and certification, and then even more money on dive shops (businesses run by expert divers who provide training and tours), flights and accommodation. For passionate divers, it’s more than just a hobby.
Deepblu CEO James Tsuei
“It’s like golfing,” says Tsuei. “There’s a higher barrier to entry because it takes time and money, but it also becomes part of your lifestyle.” Out of the 40,000 members of Deepblu’s social network, the company says about 40% have uploaded their own dive logs, which is a very high level of engagement for any online community (Deepblu also syncs with Bluetooth-enabled dive computers from major diving gear brands like Scubapro and Tusa or lets members enter data manually).
For service providers, one of Planet Deepblu’s value propositions is reaching younger divers. Although scuba divers are passionate about what they do, Tsuei says that in many key markets, including the Caribbean, divers are aging into their sixties, but their kids aren’t following them into the sport. Instead, younger people are turning to surfing and extreme sports. Emerging markets like China and Southeast Asia, however, are seeing an increase in young divers.
Planet Deepblu can help dive shops around the world reach them (about 60% of its users come from in the United States or Taiwan, but 20% are based in China and the rest are mainly in Korea, Southeast Asia and Europe). Part of Deepblu’s future plans include creating a “LinkedIn for Divers,” with features like verified profiles for people who upload a copy of their license, which can help freelance professional divers find more clients.", technology

Cloudflare  decided to use April Fool’s Day (4/1) to share some news about four 1’s that could help speed your internet browsing. The company announced today that it’s launching a DNS service for consumers called 1.1.1.1
The company’s tool — which is not some super nerdy April Fool’s joke — will allow users to shorten load times of web pages and keep some data away from network providers. Cloudfare boasts it will be “the Internet’s fastest, privacy-first consumer DNS service.”
In layman’s terms, by punching the number 1 four times into their DNS network info, consumers can hand the reins over to Cloudflare to connect the URL that they type into the tool bar — say, techcrunch.com — with that site’s IP address, a process that’s done by making requests to the Domain Name System (DNS). If you go to 1.1.1.1, you’ll get some info on how to enable this on the device that you’re on.
It’s completely separate from the startup’s authoritative DNS service for its customers but it does take advantage of Cloudflare’s existing network to provide the fastest speeds possible to users, shaving off milliseconds from other service like Google’s Public DNS Service.
It’s important to note that this DNS service isn’t some magical catch-all, you’re still much better off operating a VPN if you don’t want any of your web activity being exposed. One of the main use cases that the company seems to be tackling here is how governments have used DNS to get network providers to censor citizens access to the web.
“[I]t’s been depressing to us to watch all too frequently how DNS can be used as a tool of censorship against many of the groups we protect. While we’re good at stopping cyber attacks, if a consumer’s DNS gets blocked there’s been nothing we could do to help,” Prince said in blog post.
The company says that the new service will help keep some data out of ISPs’ hands and that they won’t keep data in their hands for long either. Cloudflare has pledged to both never write users’ IP addresses to disk and that they’ll purge all logs from their system after 24 hours. CEO Matthew Prince doesn’t want you taking their word for it though, he detailed in a blog that the company has paid for an independent audit firm to take a look at their code annually and ensure that they’ve been doing this.
Cloudflare has always seemed to prioritize securing a healthy future for the internet, that’s led it into some tough predicaments with like Nazis and stuff, with this latest launch it seems that the company is trying to enact some positive changes for promoting privacy and speed on the consumer side.", technology

From an accessibility news standpoint, this week’s Apple event in Chicago was antithetical to the October 2016 event. At the latter event, Apple  began the presentation with a bang — showing the actual video being edited using Switch Control in Final Cut. Tim Cook came out afterwards to talk some about Apple’s commitment to serving the disabled community before unveiling the then-new accessibility page on the company’s website.

By contrast, the education-themed event in Chicago  this week went by with barely a mention of accessibility. The only specific call-out came during Greg Joswiak’s time on stage talking about iPad, when he said “accessibility features make iPad a learning tool for everyone.”
That doesn’t mean, however, accessibility has no relevance to what was announced.
I was in the audience at Lane Tech College Prep on Tuesday covering the event. As a former special educator –and special education student — I watched with keen interest as Apple told their story around education. While Apple is targeting the mainstream, I came away with strong impressions on how Apple can make serious inroads in furthering special education as well.
Apple is obviously—rightfully—building their educational strategy towards mainstream students in mainstream classes. It’s a classic top-down approach: Teachers assign students work via handouts, for such activities as writing essays or completing science projects. This is the entire reason for Apple’s Classroom and Schoolwork apps. However well-designed, they lack an element.
Where they lack is there is nothing afforded, at least in specific terms, to teachers and students in special education settings. Apple’s strategy here is defined, again, by the classic teacher-student relationship, without any regard for other models. I’m not levying a criticism on the company; this is the reality.
At many levels, special education classrooms do not function in a way that’s conducive to Apple’s vision for learning at this time. In the moderate-to-severe early childhood (Pre-K) classrooms I worked in for close to a decade, the structure was such that most, if not all, activities were augmented by a heavy dose of adult support. Furthermore, most of our students were pulled out of class at certain times for additional services such as speech services and physical/occupational therapy sessions.
In short, there were no lectures or essay prompts anywhere.
This is where accessibility comes in. There is enormous potential for Apple to dig deeper and expand the toolset they offer to educators and students. To accommodate for special education is, in my view, akin to accommodating disabled users by offering accessibility features on each of Apple’s software platforms.
Special education is special for a reason. It involves ways of teaching and learning that are unique, and the people who work and learn in these environments deserve the same consideration.
Leading up to the event, there was much talk in the Apple community of writers and podcasters that Google  is eating Apple’s lunch in the schools market because Chromebooks are dirt cheap for districts and most everyone relies on Google Docs.
I’m not interested in the particulars of this argument. What I am interested in, however, is simply pointing out that despite the perception Apple products are too expensive and less capable, they are better in one meaningful sense: accessibility.
Consider Chromebook versus iPad. In many levels of special education, an iPad is far superior to a Chromebook. The tablet’s multi-touch user interface is far more intuitive, and more importantly, iOS is built with accessibility in mind. From VoiceOver to Dynamic Type to Switch Control and more, an iPad (or an iPod Touch, for that matter) can provide a far more accessible and enriching learning experience for many students with disabilities than a Chromebook. And lest we forget the App Store effect; there are many outstanding apps geared for special ed.
This is a crucial point that many technology pundits who lament Apple’s position in the education market always seem to miss.
One area where Apple can greatly improve the lives of teachers is by broadening the Schoolwork app such that it makes IEP prep easier and, playing to Apple’s core strength, more modern. Historically, even today, IEPs are planned and written using stacks of paperwork. Goals, assessments, and consent forms are handwritten (sometimes typed) and stapled together. And being a binding legal document, teachers must ensure there are the proper signatures on every page, or else be dinged for being out of compliance with protocols. In sum: the IEP is the bane of every special educator’s existence because they take so much time.
To this end, Apple could do special education teachers a grand service by adding a module of sorts to its Schoolwork app that would allow them to more easily create and track a student’s IEP. There could be charts for tracking goal progress, as well as ways to collate and distribute documents amongst the IEP team (SLPs, OT/PT, etc) and of course parents. Teachers could even send an email to parents with any consent forms attached and encourage them to sign with Apple Pencil on their iPad, if they have one.
At the very least, it would make IEP prep infinitely more efficient, and perhaps alleviate some of the stress at the actual meetings. Digitizing the process would be game-changing, I think.
The ideas I’ve outlined here are well within Apple’s wheelhouse. They would likely need to collaborate with special educators and districts on things like IEP forms and policies, but it is certainly within them to do so. They can do this if they want.
To reiterate an earlier point, special education deserves just as much thoughtful consideration and innovation as the education industry at large. Given Apple’s unwavering support of accessibility, this is an area in which they can surely improve.", technology

There’s money, and then there’s wealth. In all likelihood, money is what most of us have (or don’t have). It’s what we use to buy lunch, pay rent or put a down payment on a house. Wealth, on the other hand, is what buys yachts. But more than superficial material things, wealth also buys financial security (and all the good and ill that comes with it) for subsequent generations.
Although close to half of Americans hold no stocks, bonds or real estate, most of the remaining half that are lucky and prosperous enough to do so choose to manage their assets on their own, or perhaps with the help of a financial advisor. But as you move further along the privileged end of the socio-economic curve, managing, preserving and growing one’s wealth becomes more complicated.
Many of the world’s highest-net-worth (HNW) families employ an entire office full of accountants, lawyers and investment professionals to manage their assets. These “family offices” sometimes manage the assets of more than one family, but they are still relatively close-knit.
Historically, family offices haven’t made many direct investments into individual tech startups, instead favoring a more diversified approach to tech investing by being limited partners in venture capital and other private-market funds. Or, outside of tech, they invest in public-market equities, real estate, fixed income or other “alternative” asset classes besides VC, PE and hedge funds, according to a 2017 article about ultra HNW investors’ portfolios from KKR.
Increasingly, however, family offices are investing more into individual tech startups, at least according to anecdotal reports and a recent funding round Crunchbase News covered. But one anecdote doesn’t document a trend, so let’s take a look at the numbers.
Data covering direct startup investments from family offices listed in Crunchbase bears out that trend. The chart below is based on more than 1,700 venture deals (seed, angel, equity crowdfunding, Series A, Series B, etc.) struck with individual technology companies by 193 family offices located around the world.

The 193 family offices with listed venture investments are, no doubt, only a fraction of the total count of such groups, which tend to be private. Combined with the fact that many startups are slow to announce funding, it’s not like the list of funding rounds or their participants is comprehensive. However, assuming it’s fairly representative, we can treat the figure above as a directional indicator of general trends.
And what are those trends?
First off, at least when it comes to deal volume, family offices’ startup investment activity tracks with the broader venture investment market (which includes individual angels, venture capital groups, seed funds, accelerators and others).
During the several years leading up to 2015, there was a run-up in the number of deals being struck. After that high point, though, deal volume began to decline in the U.S., which Crunchbase News has documented, as investors eschewed writing many smaller checks to early-stage startups, instead favoring fewer, larger checks with later-stage tech companies. On a global scale, projected deal volume is roughly flat on an annualized basis from 2015 through 2017, whereas reported deal data is down primarily due to reporting delays. Because there are more U.S. family offices that invest in startups than international ones, it’s not surprising to see that family office deal volume hews closer to the U.S. market in general.
But what’s different about family offices — and what lends credence to the anecdotal evidence suggesting there are more family offices investing in more startups — is the growth rate in deal volume over time as compared to institutional venture capital investors. To be sure, worldwide, there were more deals struck by both types of investor in 2017 than in 2010 (even when accounting for reporting delays). But the difference between these two types of investor is in the magnitude of the change.
In the chart below, we compare reported deal volume between VC funds (which have a lot of known deals per year) and family offices (which, as we showed above, have much fewer recorded startup investment deals per year). We adjust for this discrepancy in deal volume by indexing reported deal volume against 2010 levels. In doing so, we’re able to deliver a relativistic, apples-to-apples comparison between the two.

Worldwide, in 2015, reported deal volume from VC firms was almost precisely 2.5x that of 2010’s totals. But that multiple for family offices is roughly 6x. And, although it isn’t pictured above, family office deal volume growth outperformed traditional VC between 2011-2017, 2012-2017 and 2013-2017.
In relative terms, across a range of measures, deal volume growth was higher and faster among family offices than VC funds for a significant period of time. The data suggest that family offices making direct investments into startups recently became a trend. Especially for that period through 2014, family offices were on the early side of the adoption curve for making direct startup investments. Whatever growth we see on the VC side is the product of growth in the market in general, but it’s not like VC funds are still adopting direct startup investments into their repertoire. It’s been their model for decades. For comparatively stodgy family offices, it was still the new, new thing.", technology

The team behind the popular open-source CMS Drupal is urging admins to update their sites to ward off a nasty bug that could leave their sites “highly compromised” to attackers, according to the organization.
The effected versions (Drupal  6, 7 and 8) of the CMS power over one million websites on the internet.
Drupal has marked the security risk as “highly critical” and warns that any visitor to the site could theoretically hack it through remote code execution due to a missing input validation.
“This potentially allows attackers to exploit multiple attack vectors on a Drupal site, which could result in the site being completely compromised,” the group noted in a blog post.
Drupal sent out an alert last week, telling users that they’d be dropping a “highly critical release” this weekend and they should update immediately. The announcement was unusual for Drupal and left developers on high alert for the targeted time frame of the release on Friday. Sites running vulnerable versions of Drupal, should update to Drupal 7.58 or Drupal 8.5.1 as soon as possible to avoid exploits. Drupal notes that they have yet to see any reports of exploits in the wild yet.
The bug’s official identifier is CVE-2018-7600 though users on social media have taken to calling it drupalgeddon2, referencing another major release from the org in 2014.", technology

Facebook  is scrambling to add safeguards against abuse of user data as it reels from backlash over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Now TechCrunch has learned Facebook will launch a certification tool that demands that marketers guarantee email addresses used for ad targeting were rightfully attained. This new Custom Audiences certification tool was described by Facebook representatives to their marketing clients, according to two sources. Facebook will also prevent the sharing of Custom Audience data across Business accounts. 
This snippet of a message sent by a Facebook rep to a client notes that “for any Custom Audiences data imported into Facebook, Advertisers will be required to represent and warrant that proper user content has been obtained.” 
Once shown the message, Facebook spokesperson Elisabeth Diana told TechCrunch “I can confirm there is a permissions tool that we’re building.” It will require that advertisers and the agencies representing them pledge that “I certify that I have permission to use this data”, she said.
Diana noted that “We’ve always had terms in place to ensure that advertisers have consent for data they use but we’re going to make that much more prominent and educate advertisers on the way they can use the data.” The change isn’t in response to a specific incident, but Facebook does plan to re-review the way it works with third-party data measurement firms to ensure everything is responsibly used. This is a way to safeguard data” Diana concluded.The company declined to specify whether it’s ever blocked usage of a Custom Audience because it suspected the owner didn’t have user consent. ”
The social network is hoping to prevent further misuse of ill-gotten data after Dr. Aleksandr Kogan’s app that pulled data on 50 million Facebook users was passed to Cambridge Analytica  in violation of Facebook policy. That sordid data is suspected to have been used by Cambridge Analytica to support the Trump and Brexit campaigns, which employed Custom Audiences to reach voters.

Facebook launched Custom Audiences back in 2012 to let businesses upload hashed lists of their customers email addresses or phone numbers, allowing advertisers to target specific people instead of broad demographics. Custom Audiences quickly became one of Facebook’s most powerful advertising options because businesses could easily reach existing customers to drive repeat sales. The Custom Audiences terms of service require that businesses have “provided appropriate notice to and secured any necessary consent from the data subjects” to attain and use these people’s contact info.
But just like Facebook’s policy told app developers like Kogan not to sell, share, or misuse data they collected from Facebook users, the company didn’t go further to enforce this rule. It essentially trusted that the fear of legal repercussions or suspension on Facebook would deter violations of both its app data privacy and Custom Audiences consent policies. With clear financial incentives to bend or break those rules and limited effort spent investigating to ensure compliance, Facebook left itself and its users open to exploitation.
Last week Facebook banned the use of third-party data brokers like Experian and Acxiom for ad targeting, closing a marketing featured called Partner Categories. Facebook is believed to have been trying to prevent any ill-gotten data from being laundered through these data brokers and then directly imported to Facebook to target users. But that left open the option for businesses to compile illicit data sets or pull them from data brokers, then upload them to Facebook as Custom Audiences by themselves.
The Custom Audiences certification tool could close that loophole. It’s still being built, so Facebook wouldn’t say exactly how it will work. I asked if Facebook would scan uploaded user lists and try to match them against a database of suspicious data, but for now it sounds more like Facebook will merely require a written promise.
Meanwhile, barring the sharing of Custom Audiences between Business Accounts might prevent those with access to email lists from using them to promote companies unrelated to the one to which users gave their email address. Facebook declined to comment on how the new ban on Custom Audience sharing would work.
Now Facebook must find ways to thwart misuse of its targeting tools and audit anyone it suspects may have already violated its policies. Otherwise it may receive the ire of privacy-conscious users and critics, and strengthen the case for substantial regulation of its ads (though regulation could end up protecting Facebook from competitors who can’t afford compliance). Still the question remains why it took such a massive data privacy scandal for Facebook to take a tougher stance on requiring user consent for ad targeting. And given that written promises didn’t stop Kogan or Cambridge Analytica from misusing data, why would they stop advertisers bent on boosting profits?

Terrace House is a tough show to explain.
Like The Real World and other reality TV, the show puts a group of largely young and attractive strangers together in a house. But that’s about where the similarities end.
On Terrace House, most of the cast members genuinely seem to be rooting for each other. And while there’s drama, it’s scaled way back, so that passive aggressive remarks about soup can end up dominating an episode.
Darrell’s a big fan, so on this week’s episode of the Original Content podcast, we checked out the latest season, Opening New Doors (a co-production of Netflix and Japanese TV network Fuji).

At a time when the models of traditional social networks are being questioned, it’s more important than ever to experiment with alternatives. Arbtr is a proposed social network that limits users to sharing a single thing at any given time, encouraging “ruthless self-editing” and avoiding “nasty things” like endless feeds filled with trivial garbage.
It’s seeking funds on Kickstarter and could use a buck or two. I plan to.
Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Why would I give money to maybe join a social network eventually that might not have any of my friends on it on it? That is, if it ever even exists?” Great question.
The answer is: how else do you think we’re going to replace Facebook? Someone with a smart, different idea has to come along and we have to support them. If we won’t spare the cost of a cup of coffee for a purpose like that, then we deserve the social networks we’ve got. (And if I’m honest, I’ve had very similar ideas over the last few years and I’m eager to see how they might play out in reality.)
The fundamental feature is, of course, the single-sharing thing. You can only show off one item at a time, and when you post a new one, the old one (and any discussion, likes, etc) will be deleted. There will be options to keep logs of these things, and maybe premium features to access them (or perhaps metrics), but the basic proposal is, I think, quite sound — at the very least, worth trying.
Some design ideas for the app. I like the text one but it does need thumbnails.
If you’re sharing less, as Arbtr insists you will, then presumably you’ll put more love behind those things you do share. Wouldn’t that be nice?
We’re in this mess because we bought wholesale the idea that the more you share, the more connected you are. Now that we’ve found that isn’t the case – and in fact we were in effect being fattened for a perpetual slaughter — I don’t see why we shouldn’t try something else.
Will it be Arbtr? I don’t know. Probably not, but we’ve got a lot to gain by giving ideas like this a shot.", technology

At last, a use for that industrial knitting machine you bought at a yard sale! Carnegie Mellon researchers have created a method that generates knitting patterns for arbitrary 3D shapes, opening the possibility of “on-demand knitting.” Think 3D printing, but softer.
The idea is actually quite compelling for those of us who are picky about their knitwear. How often have we picked up a knit cap, glove, or scarf only to find it too long, too short, too tight, too loose, etc?
If you fed your sartorial requirements (a 3D mesh) into this system from James McCann and students at CMU’s Textiles Lab, it could quickly spit out a pattern that a knitting machine could follow easily yet is perfectly suited for your purposes.
This has to be done carefully — the machines aren’t the same as human knitters, obviously, and a poorly configured pattern might lead to yarn breaking or jamming the machine. But it’s a lot better than having to build that pattern purl by purl.
With a little more work, “Knitting machines could become as easy to use as 3D printers,” McCann said in a CMU news release.
Of course, it’s unlikely you’ll have one of your own. But maker spaces and designer ateliers (I believe that’s the term) will be more likely to if it’s this easy to create new and perfectly sized garments with them.

The Red Hat Linux distribution is turning 25 years old this week. What started as one of the earliest Linux distributions is now the most successful open-source company, and its success was a catalyst for others to follow its model. Today’s open-source world is very different from those heady days in the mid-1990s when Linux looked to be challenging Microsoft’s dominance on the desktop, but Red Hat is still going strong.
To put all of this into perspective, I sat down with the company’s current CEO (and former Delta Air Lines COO) Jim Whitehurst to talk about the past, present and future of the company, and open-source software in general. Whitehurst took the Red Hat  CEO position 10 years ago, so while he wasn’t there in the earliest days, he definitely witnessed the evolution of open source in the enterprise, which is now more widespread than every.
“Ten years ago, open source at the time was really focused on offering viable alternatives to traditional software,” he told me. “We were selling layers of technology to replace existing technology. […] At the time, it was open source showing that we can build open-source tech at lower cost. The value proposition was that it was cheaper.”
At the time, he argues, the market was about replacing Windows with Linux or IBM’s WebSphere with JBoss. And that defined Red Hat’s role in the ecosystem, too, which was less about technological information than about packaging. “For Red Hat, we started off taking these open-source projects and making them usable for traditional enterprises,” said Whitehurst.

About five or six ago, something changed, though. Large corporations, including Google and Facebook, started open sourcing their own projects because they didn’t look at some of the infrastructure technologies they opened up as competitive advantages. Instead, having them out in the open allowed them to profit from the ecosystems that formed around that. “The biggest part is it’s not just Google and Facebook finding religion,” said Whitehurst. “The social tech around open source made it easy to make projects happen. Companies got credit for that.”
He also noted that developers now look at their open-source contributions as part of their resumé. With an increasingly mobile workforce that regularly moves between jobs, companies that want to compete for talent are almost forced to open source at least some of the technologies that don’t give them a competitive advantage.
As the open-source ecosystem evolved, so did Red Hat. As enterprises started to understand the value of open source (and stopped being afraid of it), Red Hat shifted from simply talking to potential customers about savings to how open source can help them drive innovation. “We’ve gone from being commeditizers to being innovators. The tech we are driving is now driving net new innovation,” explained Whitehurst. “We are now not going in to talk about saving money but to help drive innovation inside a company.”
Over the last few years, that included making acquisitions to help drive this innovation. In 2015, Red Hat bought IT automation service Ansible, for example, and last month, the company closed its acquisition of CoreOS, one of the larger independent players in the Kubernetes container ecosystem — all while staying true to its open-source root.
There is only so much innovation you can do around a Linux distribution, though, and as a public company, Red Hat also had to look beyond that core business and build on it to better serve its customers. In part, that’s what drove the company to launch services like OpenShift, for example, a container platform that sits on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and — not unlike the original Linux distribution — integrates technologies like Docker and Kubernetes and makes them more easily usable inside an enterprise.

The reason for that? “I believe that containers will be the primary way that applications will be built, deployed and managed,” he told me, and argued that his company, especially after the CoreOS acquisition, is now a leader in both containers and Kubernetes. “When you think about the importance of containers to the future of IT, it’s a clear value for us and for our customers.”
The other major open-source project Red Hat is betting on is OpenStack . That may come as a bit of a surprise, given that popular opinion in the last year or so has shifted against the massive project that wants to give enterprises an open source on-premise alternative to AWS and other cloud providers. “There was a sense among big enterprise tech companies that OpenStack was going to be their savior from Amazon,” Whitehurst said. “But even OpenStack, flawlessly executed, put you where Amazon was five years ago. If you’re Cisco or HP or any of those big OEMs, you’ll say that OpenStack was a disappointment. But from our view as a software company, we are seeing good traction.”
Because OpenStack is especially popular among telcos, Whitehurst believes it will play a major role in the shift to 5G. “When we are talking to telcos, […] we are very confident that OpenStack will be the platform for 5G rollouts.”
With OpenShift and OpenStack, Red Hat believes that it has covered both the future of application development and the infrastructure on which those applications will run. Looking a bit further ahead, though, Whitehurst also noted that the company is starting to look at how it can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to make its own products smarter and more secure, but also at how it can use its technologies to enable edge computing. “Now that large enterprises are also contributing to open source, we have a virtually unlimited amount of material to bring our knowledge to,” he said.

At some point in the not-so-distant past, April Fools was about pranks and hoaxes, but given that we apparently have enough of those on the web, the day has somehow morphed into a celebration of random jokey things. This year’s Google  Maps gag is no exception.
Starting today, when you open Google Maps on your phone or desktop, you’ll see Waldo in his trademark red and white sweater, waving at you you from the side of your screen. That’s because Waldo  is sharing his location with you for the next few days and he really wants to be found (or not… I’m never quite sure about what Waldo’s real motivations are…). You can also ask the Google Assistant “Hey Google. Where’s Waldo?”
Then, when you click on Waldo in the map, you get to see a standard “Where is Waldo” image and your job is to find him, as well as Woof, Wenda, Wizard Whitebeard and Odlaw.
Now if Google had wanted to make this a real April Fools joke, it would’ve announced this and then never released it or just shown you a standard “Where is Waldo” image without Waldo. That way, it would’ve driven everybody mad. But I’m pretty sure it’s for real, so head over to Google Maps and give it a try.

The CEO and COO are at their desks when I knock on the door, intently assembling robots to fulfill the company’s latest order. Tapster is about as lean as startups get. Founded three years ago (on Star Wars Day), the company’s two-person staff is half the size it was at its height, but a third employee moved on, and the fourth was more of an intern, really. 
It’s a humble operation headquartered in nondescript strip of stores in Oak Park, a quiet suburban village just outside of Chicago. Inside, a row of desktop 3D printers churn away on the products. Pieces of future robots are strewn about the desks, pulled from nearby shelves stocked with bins full of parts.
To their right, crumbling wooden prototypes stand as a kind of museum to the humble company’s even humbler origins. An accidental startup of sorts, Tapster formed while Jason Huggins was working as CTO of his previous company, Sauce Labs — a Selenium testing startup.

Burned out from software, the story goes, he enrolled in a laser cutting class at bygone maker space chain, Tech Shop. With those newfound skills, he built a button-clicking robot, and then, eventually, one capable of playing Angry Birds — all the rage back in 2011.The project gave Huggins a small YouTube hit and earned him speaking gigs at various tech conferences. 
It also managed to grab the attention of Mercedes-Benz. The luxury car maker was searching for an automated device to help test a self-parking app on its in-car touchscreen displays. 
“They got a price quote from an industrial robotics company, and the quote was about $100,000,” says Huggins. “They have lots of money and they could have bought it, but they had to get like 10 of them. The traditional robotics market is buying one big machine to do something precisely. We’re coming in and making the robots cheaper, so you can buy more of them.”

A few months prior to officially founding the company, Huggins began work on his order for the car maker — 10 small robots designed to automate the testing of touchscreens by repeatedly and systematically tapping the hell out of them. 
“Right before they found us, they were going to buy a LEGO Mindstorm kit and have two engineers work on it for five or six months and figure out what they could come up with,” Huggins adds. “Often our competition is do-it-yourself. They’re trying to bubblegum and duct tape something together.”

Granted, Tapster’s own processes aren’t too far removed. Huggins is a former Google Tester who’s become something of a full-time tinkerer, building robots from LEGO kits and self-modeled 3D-printed parts. He shows me a prototype of the company’s latest robot, which stands on a pair of Ronald McDonald feet.
“I couldn’t find clown shoes on Thingiverse,” he tells me, excitedly. “So I made them. If you look up ‘Clown Shoes,’ you’ll find mine.”
These sorts of automated robotics are common for hardware manufacturers looking to test touchscreens. And while Tapster’s offerings are admittedly less sophisticated that the single service industrial robotics being deployed by larger organizations, Tapster is able to deliver their highly specialized product for a fraction of the cost.

Huggins hopes to one day make Tapster the go-to product for automated touchscreen testing, but for now, it’s baby steps. To date, the startup has functioned on a combination of self-funding, product sales and $100,000 in backing from Indie.vc, a micro venture firm that invests in “Real businesses want to stay in business, not run for the exit.”
“This is my second startup, and I’m really intentional about bootstrapping for as long as possible,” says Huggins. “I’m not anti-VC, but I’m definitely pro-having leverage. When you can walk in there say, ‘this is a train leaving the station and money can accelerate these trend lines,’ I’d like to be in that situation. That means I have to do more things longer. I’m not going out there and raising a seed round and hiring. I want to have a solid business I can hire into.”", technology

Tesla  has provided another update to last week’s fatal crash. As it turns out, Tesla said the driver had Autopilot on with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. However, it seems the driver ignored the vehicle’s warnings to take back control.
“The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,” Tesla wrote in a blog post. “The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.”
The promise of Tesla’s Autopilot  system is to reduce car accidents. In the company’s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents.
As Tesla previously noted, the crash was so severe because the middle divider on the highway had been damaged in an earlier accident. Tesla also cautioned that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, but it does make them less likely to occur.
No one knows about the accidents that didn’t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars.
In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer’s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss.
This development, of course, comes in light of a fatal accident involving one of Uber’s self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona.", technology

Uber  is closing the doors on its on-demand package delivery service for merchants, RUSH, in New York City, San Francisco and Chicago, TechCrunch has learned. In an email to users, Uber said it plans to close RUSH operations June 30, 2018.

We’re already applying a lot of the lessons we learned together to our UberEats food delivery business in over 200 global markets across more than 100,000 restaurants.”
With UberRUSH, which I forgot still existed, people can request deliveries for items no more than 30 pounds in size, except animals, alcohol, illegal items, stolen goods and dangerous items like guns and explosives. Last April, Uber stopped providing courier services to restaurants, encouraging them to instead use UberEATS, the company’s food delivery service. The shutdown of UberRUSH comes shortly after Shyp, an on-demand shipping company, announced its last day of operations.", technology

Back in July of last year, Niantic organized an outdoor festival focusing on its augmented reality game, Pokémon GO. In theory, players would come from all around for a day of wandering Chicago’s Grant Park, meeting other players and catching new/rare Pokémon.
It… did not go as planned. Widespread cellular connectivity and logistical issues brought the game (and thus the event itself) to a halt before the doors even opened. People booed. People threw things at the stage. People sued.
While Niantic quickly announced that they’d be refunding all ticket costs (and giving players $100 of in-game currency), that still left many of the estimated 20,000 attendees out the cost of hotels, transportation, etc.
Niantic is settling a class action suit surrounding the festival, TechCrunch has learned, paying out $1,575,000 dollars to reimburse various costs attendees might have picked up along the way. Things like airfare, hotel costs, up to two days of parking fees, car rental, mileage and tolls.
According to documents filed in a Chicago court, an official website for the settlement should be up by May 25th, 2018, with an email sent to let attendees know. The documents also note a few potential catches: those claiming part of the settlement will need to have checked in to GO Fest through the game (presumably to prevent those who sold their tickets for a markup from getting more money out of it), and anyone claiming more than $107 in expenses will need to have receipts.
If there’s money left after all claims, lawyer fees, etc, the documents note that the remaining balance will be split evenly and donated to the Illinois Bar foundation and the nonprofit organization Chicago Run. “In no event will money revert back to Niantic” it reads.", technology

Dozens of high-tech phone smugglers have been apprehended by Chinese police, who twigged to the scheme to send refurbished iPhones into the country from Hong Kong via drone — but not the way you might think.
China’s Legal Daily reported the news (and Reuters noted shortly after) following a police press conference; it’s apparently the first cross-border drone-based smuggling case, so likely of considerable interest.
Although the methods used by the smugglers aren’t described, a picture emerges from the details. Critically, in addition to the drones themselves, which look like DJI models with dark coverings, police collected some long wires — more than 600 feet long.
Small packages of 10 or so phones were sent one at a time, and it only took “seconds” to get them over the border. That pretty much rules out flying the drone up and over the border repeatedly — leaving aside that landing a drone in pitch darkness on the other side of a border fence (or across a body of water) would be difficult to do once or twice, let alone dozens of times, the method is also inefficient and risky.
But really, the phones only need to clear the border obstacle. So here’s what you do:
Send the drone over once with all cable attached. Confederates on the other side attach the cable to a fixed point, say 10 or 15 feet off the ground. Drone flies back unraveling the cable, and lands some distance onto the Hong Kong side. Smugglers attach a package of 10 phones to the cable with a carabiner, and the drone flies straight up. When the cable reaches a certain tension, the package slides down the cable, clearing the fence. The drone descends, and you repeat.
I’ve created a highly professional diagram to illustrate this technique (feel free to reuse):
It’s not 100 percent to scale. The far side might have to be high enough that the cable doesn’t rest on the fence, if there is one, or not to drag in the water if that’s the case. Not sure about that part.
Anyway, it’s quite smart. You get horizontal transport basically for free, and the drone only has to do what it does best: go straight up. Two wires were found, and the police said up to 15,000 phones might be sent across in a night. Assuming 10 phones per trip, and say 20 seconds per flight, that works out to 1,800 phones per hour per drone, which sounds about right. Probably this kind of thing is underway at more than a few places around the world.", technology

Slowly but surely, Alexa’s becoming a more competent catchall video assistant. Back in January, Amazon launched its Video Skill API designed to offer more control over apps from cable and satellite companies. An update this week brings the ever-important ability to use the smart assistant to start recording. 
The skill joins a number of functions already available from top providers, including Dish, TiVo, and DIRECTV and Verizon — each of whom will likely be updating their Alexa skill set to reflect the new feature. The whole thing works pretty much as you’d expect. 
Say, “Alexa, record the A’s game,” and the associated service will do just that. Or, you know, any baseball team, really. 
Also new in this update is the ability to jump directly into frequently used navigation options, like DVR interfaces or video services like Netflix or Prime, the example that Amazon gives in its post on the topic. Once in a specific program, users can ask Alexa to do things like pause the show, and the assistant will comply. 
The new skills are available now to developers and should be hitting some of the aforementioned services soon. ", technology

The abuse of Facebook’s platform for political purposes is a problem that doesn’t stop at the U.S border. Governments around the world are continuing to wrestle with the implications of Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of Facebook user data from the heart of Europe to the capitals of Latin America’s most populous nations. 
In South America, several chapters are still being written into the public record of Facebook’s privacy privations. Some Latin American democracies are also beginning to investigate whether the data harvesting techniques associated with Cambridge Analytica (CA) were used in their electoral processes. 
Facebook,  Cambridge Analytica and South America: a recap 
Brazil
The Brazilian Public Prosecutor’s Office started an investigation to clarify if Cambridge Analytica (CA) had illegal access to Facebook’s private information from millions of Brazillians through their subsidiary, a Sao Paulo-based consulting group named A Ponte Estratégia Planejamento e Pesquisa LTDA.
The investigation came as a result of Cambridge Analytica Chief Data Officer Dr Alex Tayler and Managing Director Mark Turnbull saying to an undercover journalist that the company was now targeting Brazil, among other countries. The Brazilian case is a big deal for Facebook because it is its third-largest market and has an election coming in seven months.
Argentina
Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, has an office in Buenos Aires which address matches with the office of an Argentinian agricultural enterprise called Blacksoil, according to the news outlet, Clarin. The article pointed out that Alexander Nix, former CA’s CEO, was friend of the owner of the company, Lucas Talamoni Grether with whom he had conducted business before. 
The Argentinian National Electoral Chamber (CNE), which is in charge of overseeing the elections and auditing campaign contributions and expenses, initiated an “internal investigation” following the scandal revealed by British TV Channel 4. Political parties are accusing one another of using CA services in the 2017 midterm election but there is no hard evidence either supporting or refuting the allegations.
Mexico and Colombia
Mexico, the fifth largest market for Facebook, is also involved in the Cambridge Analytica debacle. In the same video that CA executives mention targeting Brazil, they admit having operated in Mexico using an app called Pig.Gi. Mexico’s general election are due on July 1st. The same app was used to access data from Colombian users, according to the tech site Hipertextual.
Nevertheless, Pig.Gi’s founder and CEO, Joel Phillips, admitted signing a deal with the data company but says the information never got to their hands and there is no evidence that the company had any access to personal data from Mexicans or Colombians, according to the same article. 
Apart from being named by Alexander Nix in the video leak which blew up the scandal, there isn’t much empirical evidence of Cambridge Analytica actually tampering with South American electoral processes. However ineffectual Cambridge Analytica’s  efforts have been, Facebook is still on the hook when it comes to “fake news” and misinformation in the region.

Misinformed emerging democracies
During the Argentinian electoral process in 2017 hundreds of fake articles were distributed through Facebook. A fact-checking site called Chequeado compiled some of the misinformation that was distributed on the platform. 
Among them there were reports accusing the leader of a Teacher’s Union of not being a teacher; of the Buenos Aires Province Governor raising her own salary by 100% and even a claim that the US Government recorded Macri’s Administration as being the most corrupt in the world. 
There were some sites created for the sole purpose of spreading Fake News on Facebook and these pieces went viral over and over again. 
On the other hand, Brazil has steadily become a fake news heaven. The political instability that reigns in the country has made it easier for fake news to spread within fanatic circles. The Monitor Do Debate Politico No Meio Digital, an organization that follows the trail of political news in Social Networks, told El Pais that there are lots of sites which are not officially developing a systematic campaign of fake news prior to the October elections but have begun spreading fake reports in the social ecosystem. 
This scheme is repeating itself throughout Latin American countries — and with the same characteristics. It’s not necessarily systemic, but it is growing. The difference remains in the plausibility of the pieces which were spread in the region. 
Although there were no conspiracy theories that compared candidates to a reptile, in South America stories did aim to enhance what people already thought of political figures. 
According to Luciano Galup, a social media strategist for political campaigns in the region, fake news are most effective in polarized societies. A study made by Oxford University in the US, showed that extremists tend to distribute more fake information than moderates within parties. And polarization is a major characteristic of the Latin American region’s political scenario. This makes Latin America the perfect victim for people trying to tamper with elections by presenting propaganda as actual news. 
If we add that up with the lack of control from governments and Facebook attempts to solve the issue, we have a ticking time bomb. The only positive, Galup says, is that services like the ones on offer from Cambridge Analytica are prohibitively expensive for most political parties in Latin America. 
In this case, the only thing saving elections in the region from outside corrupting influences may be the greed of those same corrupting influences.", technology

When you’ve got leverage, don’t be afraid to use it. That’s been Google’s  modus operandi in the news and publishing world over the last year or so as it has pushed its AMP platform, funding various news-related ventures that may put it ahead, and nourished its personalized Chrome tabs on mobile. The latter, as Nieman Labs notes, grew 2,100 percent in 2017.
You may have noticed, since Chrome is a popular mobile browser and this setting is on by default, but the “Articles for You” appear automatically in every new tab, showing you a bunch of articles the company thinks you’d like. And it’s gone from driving 15 million article views to a staggering 341 million over the last year.
In late 2016, when Google announced the product, I described it as “polluting” the otherwise useful new tab page. I also don’t like the idea of being served news when I’m not actively looking for it — I understand that when I visit Google News (and I do) that my browser history (among other things) is being scoured to determine which categories and stories I’ll see. I also understand that everything I do on the site, as on every Google site, is being entered into its great data engine in order to improve its profile of me.
Like I said, when I visit a Google site, I expect that. But a browser is supposed to be a tool, not a private platform, and the idea that every tab I open is another data point and another opportunity for Google to foist its algorithms on me is rankling.
It has unsavory forebears. Remember Internet Explorer 6, which came with MSN.com as the default homepage? That incredible positioning drove so much traffic that, for years after (and indeed today), it drove disgusting amounts of traffic to anything it featured. But that traffic was tainted: you knew that firehose was in great part clicks from senior citizens who thought MSN was the entire internet.
Of course the generated pages for individual users aren’t the concentrated fire of a link on a major portal, but they are subject to Google approval and, of course, the requisite ranking bonus for AMP content. Can’t forget that!
But wherever you see the news first, that’s your news provider. And you can’t get much earlier than “as soon as you open a new tab.” That’s pretty much the ultimate positioning advantage.
Just how this amazing growth occurred is unclear. If there’s been any word of mouth, I missed it. “Have you tried scrolling down? The news is just right there!” It seems unlikely. My guess would be that the feature has been steadily rolling out in new regions, opting in new users who occasionally scroll down and see these stories.
And unlike many other news distribution platforms, there isn’t much for publishers or sites like this one to learn about it. How are stories qualified for inclusion? Is there overlap with Google News stuff? What’s shown if people aren’t signed in? I’ve asked Google for further info.
Do you, like me, dislike the idea that every time you open a tab — not just when you use its services — Google uses it as an opportunity to monetize you, however indirectly? Fortunately, and I may say consistent with Google’s user-friendliness in this type of thing, you can turn it off quite easily — on iOS, anyway.
Open the menu at the top right of any tab and hit settings. There should be a “Suggested articles” toggle — disable that and you’re done. While you’re at it, you might just head into Privacy and disable search and site suggestions and usage data.
On Android? You’ll have to dig into the app’s flags and toggle the hidden setting there. Not as user-friendly.", technology

ClearVoice recently launched a new feature to give freelancers a better way to show off their work and get new jobs.
CV Portfolios offer an easier alternative to personal websites that are often sparsely populated, out-of-date or otherwise neglected.
Thanks a technology that the company is calling VoiceGraph, writers no longer have to keep the pages updated themselves. Instead, co-founder and CEO Joe Griffin said VoiceGraph indexes stories from the top publishers online (about 250,000 currently) and matches them to their authors. It also aggregates metrics around social sharing and connecting to the authors’ own social media accounts.
“At the end of the day, what we want to do here is give freelancers very robust tools that make it as simple as possible to address one of the biggest hurdles freelancers were having: creating a portfolio and maintaining it,” Griffin said.

So for example, you can visit my CV Portfolio to see many of my latest TechCrunch articles. Granted, that’s not that so exciting, since you can do the same thing on my TechCrunch author page, but this could be pretty useful if I was a freelancer with a variety of publishers, or if I wanted to highlight articles I wrote for past employers.
There were around 400,000 automatically generated CV Portfolios at launch. Authors can claim their profiles, then edit them by creating new sections, moving articles around, deleting work that they’re not proud of, adding links or uploading files. And again, it’s a lot easier because they’re starting with a portfolio that’s already populated and automatically updated with new stories.
(And yes, if you’re a freelancer with an automatically generated portfolio that you don’t want on ClearVoice, Griffin said you can just delete it.)
The product is free. Sure, you can can use your CV Portfolio to promote yourself on ClearVoice’s talent marketplace, where freelancers get hired by companies to help with content marketing. But Griffin said he’s perfectly fine if people just want to create CV Portfolios and don’t participate in the market at all.", technology

At the Adobe Summit in Las Vegas this week, privacy was on the minds of many people. It was no wonder with social media data abuse dominating the headlines, GDPR just around the corner, and Adobe announcing the concept of a centralized customer experience record.
With so many high profile breaches in recent years, putting your customer data in a central record-keeping system would seem to be a dangerous proposition, yet Adobe sees so many positives for marketers, it likely believes this to be a worthy trade-off.
Which is not to say that the company doesn’t see the risks. Executives speaking at the conference continually insisted that privacy is always part of the conversation at Adobe as they build tools — and they have built in security and privacy safeguards into the customer experience record.
Ben Kepes, an independent analyst says this kind of data collection does raise ethical questions about how to use it. “This new central repository of data about individuals is going to be incredibly attractive to Adobe’s customers. The company is doing what big brands and corporations ask for. But in these post-Cambridge Analytica days, I wonder how much of a moral obligation Adobe and the other vendors have to ensure their tools are used for good purposes,” Kepes asked.
It’s worth pointing out that the goal of this exercise isn’t simply to collect data for data’s sake. It’s to offer consumers a more customized and streamlined experience. How does that work? There was a demo in the keynote illustrating a woman’s experience with a hotel brand.

The mythical woman started a reservation for a trip to New York City, got distracted in the middle and was later “reminded” to return to it via Facebook ad. She completed the reservation and was later issued a digital key to her room, allowing her to bypass the front desk check-in process. Further, there was a personal greeting on the television in her room with a custom message and suggestions for entertainment based on her known preferences.
As one journalist pointed out in the press event, this level of detail from the hotel is not something that would thrill him (beyond the electronic check-in). Yet there doesn’t seem to be a way to opt out of that data (unless you live in the EU and will be subject to GDPR rules).
As it turns out, that reporter wasn’t alone. According to a survey conducted last year by The Economist Intelligence Unit in conjunction with ForgeRock, an identity management company, consumers are not just willing sheep that tech companies may think we are.
The survey was conducted last October with 1,629 consumers participating from eight countries including Australia, China, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US. It’s worth noting that survey questions were asked in the context of Internet of Things data, but it seems that the results could be more broadly applied to any types of data collection activities by brands.
There are a couple of interesting data points that perhaps brands should heed as they collect customer data in the fashion outlined by Adobe. In particular as it relates to what Adobe and other marketing software companies are trying to do to build a central customer profile, when asked to rate the statement, “I am uncomfortable with companies building a “profile” of me to predict my consumer behaviour,” 39 percent strongly agreed with that statement. Another 35 percent somewhat agreed. That would suggest that consumers aren’t necessarily thrilled with this idea.
When presented with the statement, Providing my personal information may have more drawbacks than benefits, 32 percent strongly agreed and 41 percent somewhat agreed.

That would suggest that it is on the brand to make it clearer to consumers that they are collecting that data to provide a better overall experience, because it appears that consumers who answered this survey are not necessarily making that connection.

Perhaps it wasn’t a coincidence that at a press conference after the Day One keynote announcing the unified customer experience record, many questions from analysts and journalists focused on notions of privacy. If Adobe is helping companies gather and organize customer data, what role do they have in how their customers’ use that data, what role does the brand have and how much control should consumers have over their own data?
These are questions we seem to be answering on the fly. The technology is here now or very soon will be, and wherever the data comes from, whether the web, mobile devices or the Internet of Things, we need to get a grip on the privacy implications — and we need to do it quickly. If consumers want more control as this survey suggests, maybe it’s time for companies to give it to them.", technology

The men fled; the women stayed.
That’s the story of Easter weekend in the New Testament. Most of Jesus’ male disciples vanished when the trouble started, leaving his mother and Mary Magdalene and other women to watch by the cross, prepare his body for his burial, and then (with the men still basically in hiding) find the empty tomb.
Male absence and female energy has also been the story, albeit less starkly and dramatically, of Christian practice in many times and places since. Today, most Christian churches and denominations in America — conservative as well as liberal, male-led and female-led both — have some sort of gender gap, sometimes modest but often stark. Despite their varying theologies, evangelicalism, mainline Protestantism, Mormonism and Catholicism all have about a 55-45 female-male split in religious identification; for black churches, it’s 60-40.
Meanwhile, the belief-in-God and frequency-of-prayer gaps are even larger, with American men twice as likely as women to call themselves atheists — something that will surprise exactly nobody who has sojourned among Richard Dawkins fans.
There are interesting arguments about the roots of this division: Whether women are somehow naturally more religious than men, whether Jesus’ dim view of violence is particularly off-putting to the male of the species, or whether some specific cultural shift — a feminine turn in medieval piety, the separation of the sexes in the Industrial Revolution, the late-modern turn away from martial religious language — created the modern Christian situation.
The fact that the gender gap is less apparent or reversed in the Islamic world and Israel is a suggestive indicator that something specific to Christianity is at work. But that raises an interesting question for our own society: What happens to this pattern if historic Christianity decays or transforms into something else? Does a religious gender gap diminish, or does it widen? Does our emerging post-Christian or quasi-Christian model of religiosity — the therapeutic style of Oprah, the individualized mix of prayer and meditation and self-help — potentially reconcile the sexes, or push them further apart?
These Easter thoughts are occasioned, in part, by reading some of the countless think-pieces about the rise of Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychology professor turned moral-philosophical guru for a large and grateful cohort of young men.
Inevitably, Peterson has been subsumed into our political debates, attacked as a fascist or hailed as an anti-P.C. warrior. But the clearest takes on his appeal so far have recognized his role as a tacitly religious figure, a would-be prophet for lost boys.
In complementary essays, Micah Meadowcroft and Scott Alexander have both described him a figure much like C. S. Lewis, the intellectual popularizer of Christianity — except, as Alexander says, where Lewis believed in the “Old Religion,” Peterson is “a believer in the New Religion, the one where God is the force for good inside each of us, and all religions are paths to wisdom, and the Bible stories are just guides on how to live our lives.”
This New Religion has many prophets already, of course; the most prominent, her Oprahness, can currently be seen playing an angelic being in the de-Christianized, New Age-ified adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time.” But the example of Oprah points to an interesting truth: When you think about the New Religion’s various cultural and (in the case of yoga) liturgical expressions, they generally skew female. Oprah’s roadshow of spiritual gurus includes men as well as women, but the intended audience for her revivals, as for the “The Secret” or “Eat Pray Love” or the collected works of Paulo Coelho, is very obviously feminine.
Meanwhile, men looking for post-Christian enlightenment seem to gravitate toward secular-rationalist cults like the New Atheism, or more recently toward toxic forms of alt-right politics. In this sense the post-Christian religious landscape is potentially taking Christianity’s gender gap and widening it, playing its own metaphysical role in the growing divergence and polarization of the sexes.
Which is why it will be interesting to see where Peterson and his male disciples end up going. To the extent that he has antecedents, it’s figures like the myth-theorist Joseph Campbell and the poet Robert Bly, whose “Men’s Movement” in the 1990s was a Jungian stew concocted as an antidote to fatherlessness and extended adolescence.
That’s what Peterson is offering too (his attempts to make his stew a system have inspired a certain amount of justifiable mockery; the New Religion is more convincing when it’s fuzzy), but with a particular stress on the idea that the men he’s trying to forge will be better men for women, and thus perhaps equipped to reverse the polarization of the sexes and the decline of not only marriage but even sex itself.
But can a Peterson man and an Oprah woman be happy together? Can they be at least as happy as Christian women and their somewhat-less-pious, prone-to-bolting Christian men?
A lot may hang on this strange question: the happiness of the next generation, the very existence of the generation after that.

Gratitude may be the mother of all the other virtues, as Cicero said, and it may be among the healthiest. But it’s also an elusive one in a society that is always striving for more and in a world “more full of weeping than you can understand,” as Yeats wrote.
Our tendency is to reach past what we have attained, to have expectations that lie just beyond our grasp and to ascribe our success to ourselves rather than others. It is also easy to confuse gratitude with self-satisfaction.
We all feel, from time to time, that things are never as good as they ought to be or as we want them to be. When one goal is attained, isn’t there always another one that needs to be seized? And isn’t dissatisfaction with the way things are the impetus to make things better?
Often it is. Yet life without the leavening effects of gratitude has a hardening effect. Ingratitude leaves us in a state of perpetual discontent, short-tempered, rarely at peace, rarely at rest. Stripped of gratitude, we find ourselves frustrated and fearful, impatient and on edge. Ingratitude also blinds us to the good in our midst — beauty, the wonders of nature, the gift of friendship, the blessings of family.
Ignatius of Loyola, the 16th-century Spanish theologian and founder of the Society of Jesus, better known as the Jesuits, wrote that “ingratitude is one of the things most worthy of detestation before our Creator and Lord.” It is, he said, “a failure to recognize the good things, the graces and the gifts received.”
Building on this point, Tim Keller, the founder of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City and one of America’s leading theologians, told me that ingratitude is a fundamental rather than a superficial sin. It is part and parcel of pride and self-centeredness, a deep denial of how dependent we are on God and one another. If we aren’t thankful, it’s because we don’t think we owe anyone anything.
My guess is that if you think about people you know whose lives are characterized by gratitude, you’ll find them to be outward- rather than inward-looking, quick to be kind. They approach the world with delight, a certain enchantment and a light touch. They are not blind or indifferent to the hardships and pain surrounding them, but they are still able to find joy in the journey. “The world is hot and cruel,/We are weary of heart and hand,” G. K. Chesterton wrote in a poem responding directly to Yeats. “But the world is more full of glory,/Than you can understand.”
Feeling that they are the object of affection and love, people who are grateful are more able to dispense grace to others. Gratitude finds ways to express itself; the result is a more humane, tender and merciful society.
But gratitude in its most remarkable manifestation is separate from circumstances. Those who show gratitude in the midst of hardship, as their world shatters around them, have the most to teach the rest of us.
I’ve written before about my friend Steve Hayner, who was president of Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., and a huge influence on my life. He was told he had terminal cancer on Easter weekend four years ago. (He died early in 2015.) Shortly after he learned the news, he said: “There are never any guarantees in this life, and this is a chance to take Jesus’ words to heart: ‘And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your life span?’ (Matthew 6:27). We’ll choose the way of trust and joy instead.” And so he did.
Months later, in reflecting on how things had changed for him, knowing that death soon awaited, Steve wrote: “Life is just plain different now. I like parts of my previous life better. But the choices have changed. Every day has always been an opportunity for attentiveness, gratitude and living into God’s call.” Now he had much less of a desire to “seize the day,” he said, than “to welcome it — with all its twists and turns, surprises and disappointments, moments of delight and discoveries of yet other areas to which I must pray my goodbyes and let the grieving roll.” And so he did.
None of us is exempt from periods of pain, doubt and discouragement. Even the Apostle Paul confessed in his second letter to the Corinthians that there were times when he felt the pressures of life pushed him beyond the ability to endure, “so that we despaired of life itself.”
Gratitude is hardly restricted to people of faith, just as people of faith are not exempt from ingratitude. This is another way that people don’t fit into tidy boxes. Temperament, disposition and life circumstances all play a factor in determining how we face the world.
But for many of us of the Christian faith, there are certain events that are sources of continuing thankfulness. Good Friday and Easter Sunday are pre-eminent among them. They reassure us that while suffering is unavoidable, death is not final and hope is eternal, that there are things that lie beyond the joy and anguish of this life. There is gratitude in the conviction that the story doesn’t end and that there are endless new chapters to be written, and that ultimately there is reconciliation and redemption to be found for my broken life and our broken world.

Bach biographers don’t have it easy. Has there ever been a composer who wrote so much extraordinary music and left so little documentation of his personal life?
Life-writing abhors a vacuum, and experts have indulged in all manner of speculation, generally mirroring their own approaches to the world, about how Bach must have understood himself and his works.
The current fancy is that Bach was a forward-looking, quasi-scientific thinker who had little or no genuine interest in traditional religion. “Bach’s Dialogue With Modernity,” one recent, indicative book is called. In arriving at this view, scholars have ignored, underestimated or misinterpreted a rich source of evidence: Bach’s personal three-volume Study Bible, extensively marked with his own notations. A proper assessment of this document renders absurd any notion that Bach was a progressivist or a secularist.
Bach’s copy of these tomes — which were published in 1681-82 with commentary culled by Abraham Calov from Martin Luther’s sermons and other writings — was unexpectedly discovered in the 1930s among the belongings of a German immigrant family in Frankenmuth, Mich., and is housed today at Concordia Seminary Library in St. Louis. An enterprising publisher in the Netherlands, the Uitgeverij Van Wijnen, has now issued a spectacular facsimile.
Advertisement
All three volumes are inscribed “JSBach.1733” and contain a host of handwritten corrections and comments. Bach handwriting experts have identified the vast majority of these verbal entries as “definitely Bach” or “probably Bach.” Hundreds of passages are further scrawled with marginal dashes and other nonverbal markings. Although these are harder to evaluate, physicists at the Crocker Nuclear Laboratory have concluded through ink analysis that “with high probability, Bach was also responsible for the underlinings and marginal marks.”
Advertisement
Where does all this science get us? Bach’s notations bear witness to a life of conservative Lutheran observance.
Within Calov’s scripture verses, there are many small printing errors that would doubtless go undetected by even the most biblically literate reader. Yet time and again Bach has restored text that was far from clearly missing, or has changed perfectly plausible sounding, but in fact unattested, wording to the standard Lutheran rendering. None of these corrections stem from the list of errors printed in Calov’s appendix.
Some biblical scholars have concluded from this that Bach acted like an astute textual critic, poring over Calov’s volumes and painstakingly comparing them, line by line, with other Lutheran Bibles. But there’s a simpler and more likely scenario, fully grounded in conservative 18th-century social and religious practices.
Picture the people of Bach’s household on free evenings, gathered in their living room for the activity of reading aloud. The children take turns reciting from a family Bible for practice in reading and elocution, not to mention spiritual edification. The patriarch follows along in his magnificent Study Bible, in part to make sure there’s no passage-skipping from the lectors, and in part to allow him to reach for his inkwell whenever he spots, compared with what he’s just heard, an error in Calov’s scriptural verses.
Tellingly, in something akin to what linguists call a mondegreen, Bach at several passages apparently misconstrued what the children — in this reconstruction of the scene — had said, and emended a scriptural verse’s legitimate Lutheran rendering to a similar-sounding but unattested wording. At Isaiah 16:8, Luther’s text reads: “its vine-branches are scattered, and over the sea.” Bach caught sight of Calov’s obvious typographical error “Fesser,” but he evidently misheard a lector’s utterance of the correct wording, and thus emended Luther’s intended “Feser” (vine-branches) to the biblically unattested “Fäßer” (wine-casks).
The Calov volumes also provide insight into Bach’s professional and personal concerns, showing that he understood himself less as a modern artist than as a preacher who was following his religious vocation. An annotation in Latin that the Crocker Laboratory physicists have filed under “definite Bach entries” makes for especially poignant reading, as it takes note of manifold passages in the Bible’s Solomonic literature speaking of how to find godly solace in a world that is hostile to people faithfully pursuing their divine callings. Sundry administrative records indicate that Bach often fell into trouble over philosophical differences with his employers about the place of music in worship and in education.
Only a handful of Bach’s entries in Calov concern music, and these have received the most extensive — indeed, typically the only — attention from biographers. Leading writers have striven to explain these marginalia as progressive. In truth, all of them straightforwardly reflect conservative Lutheran thinking. What they share as well is a premodern interpretive approach called “typology,” whereby events and principles in the era of ancient Israel act as “types” or “shadows” for their correlated “antitypes” or “substances” in the era of Christianity. Typology was looked upon less as a scholarly path to intellectual understanding than as a doctrinal path to spiritual comfort.
Citing one of Bach’s annotations on music as key progressivist testimony, John Eliot Gardiner, in his 2013 biography “Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven,” wrote: “Bach understood that the more perfectly a composition is realized, both conceptually and through performance, the more God is immanent in the music. ‘NB,’ he wrote in the margin of his copy of Abraham Calov’s Bible commentary, ‘Where there is devotional music, God with his grace is always present.’ This strikes me as a tenet that many of us as musicians automatically hold and aspire to whenever we meet to play music, regardless of whatever ‘God’ we happen to believe in.”

What a lovely, modern idea! Alas, no aspect of it could possibly have been part of Bach’s understanding.
Lutherans like Bach certainly would have condemned as a grievous sin of idolatry any notion that the essence of a piece of music is, or turns into, the essence of God. And Bach’s somewhat cryptic note is not even about the less heretical notion of God’s possibly just “dwelling” within music, either. Its language plainly echoes more particularized orthodox Lutheran observations about God and music that were laid out in Johann Gerhard’s “School of Piety” (1623), one of many books of practical theology listed in Bach’s estate inventory.
Thus the impetus behind Bach’s remark was not progressivist but doctrinal. The Old Testament text Bach commented on presents the “shadow”: At the sound of the priestly music, the “Glory of the Lord” inhabited the Jerusalem Temple. Bach’s marginal note points to the orthodox Lutheran understanding of the “substance”: At a rendering of devout music, the “Grace-Presence” of God will always inhabit the hearts of Christian believers, whose bodies, according to the New Testament, are “a temple of the Holy Spirit.” Bach had worked with these very tenets earlier in his career, when he composed glorious musical settings of them in his Cantata No. 172, “Ring Out, Ye Songs.”
Beside another significant passage in Calov, Bach wrote, “A splendid demonstration [‘Beweis’] that music has been mandated by God’s spirit.” Christoph Wolff’s magisterial biography, “Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician” (2000), identifies Bach’s use of “Beweis” here as an approving nod toward the term’s centrality in the progressive methodology of scientific empiricism, a methodology that was held already during Bach’s lifetime to be applicable also to theological principles.
But the noun “Beweis” was also used frequently, from the 16th through 18th centuries, in the same conservative way it’s used in Bach’s note: for the “demonstration” of theological principles through study of biblical revelation alone. Bach’s music likewise employs the word “Beweis” in its conventional pre‑Enlightenment, nonscientific sense. A recitative in his “Christmas Oratorio” proclaims that a believer’s heart should safeguard the biblical account of the miracle of Christ’s birth “as a sure demonstration [‘Beweis’]” of salvation.
Bach was contractually answerable for choosing the liturgical poetry he set to music, and modern-day critics, in a bit of wishful thinking, often proclaim that his theologically conservative choices were designed simply to please his employers. But on this biographical question, the Calov volumes turn out to be acutely instructive. The sentiments expressed in Bach’s vocal music are continually paralleled in his Calov notations. Most of his vocal music was composed from the 1710s to 1730s, whereas his Calov notations were entered in the 1730s and 1740s. In view of the fact that almost all the private notations come well after the public compositions, Bach obviously subscribed to the sentiments expressed in his vocal music.
Both Bach’s music and his Calov notations put powerful stress upon: (1) contempt for human reason, along with the exalting of biblical revelation as the proper arbiter of truth; (2) disparagement of notions of human autonomy and achievement, along with the exalting of dependence on God, including for one’s position in the social hierarchy; (3) contempt — explicit or implicit — for Judaism, Catholicism and Islam, along with the exalting of orthodox Lutheranism; (4) disdain for foreigners, along with the exalting of German faithfulness and goodness; and (5) the emphatic exalting of monarchical power, as authorized not by the people but by God. Nowhere in Bach’s music or Calov notations are these sentiments contradicted.
In short, Bach, in his unswerving religious conservatism, was living and working very much at odds with the progressivist currents of his day, and ours. While we’re arguably free to make use of him and his music in whatever new ways we find fitting, we ought also to be on the ethical alert for casting Bach in our own image.

 CONCEPCIÓN DE LEÓN

As hundreds of millions of people prepare to celebrate Easter and Passover, here are three books that reckon with religion and spirituality.
WHY I AM A CATHOLICBy Garry Wills390 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. (2002)
Half history of the papacy and half investigation of the writer’s faith, Wills’s book is a response to readers who, after he wrote “Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit,” a critique of the Catholic church and its hierarchy, asked why he remained a Catholic. Wills has “never even considered leaving the Church,” he writes, yet he does not present himself as a Catholic missionary. What he delivers instead is a balanced critique and a defense of his view that one can be both devoted to and critical of one’s faith. Our reviewer called this book “candid, richly informative and perfectly timed.”
MAN SEEKS GODMy Flirtations With the DivineBy Eric Weiner349 pp. Twelve. (2011)
Weiner, a former foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, is compelled to begin his religious exploration when, while he is enduring a medical scare, a nurse asks him: “Have you found your God yet?” Weiner grew up in a family of “gastronomical Jews,” for whom he writes, “ God resided not in Heaven or the Great Void but in the Frigidaire, somewhere between the cream cheese and the salad dressing.” This sentence might give you some indication of the humor with which he narrates his trip, which takes him to places such as Turkey to explore Sufism and the South Bronx, where he spends time with Franciscan monks.
THE WISDOM OF SUNDAYSLife-Changing Insights from Super Soul ConversationsBy Oprah Winfrey240 pp. Flatiron Books. (2017)
Every week, on her television show “Super Soul Sunday,” Winfrey explores spirituality with a rotating selection of star guests; Arianna Huffington, Shonda Rhimes and Joe Biden have all been guests. Here, she brings together excerpts from those conversations, as well as personal photographs taken in her home in Santa Barbara “where I feel the presence of God, and the connection to All that is greater than myself, most deeply,” she writes in the book’s introduction. She begins most of her “Super Soul Sunday” conversations with the same question: “What does spirituality mean to you?” The replies have helped Winfrey along her spiritual path, and this book explores how this wisdom has stayed with her.

Western sydney
By Sheila Ngoc Pham
On a warm day in Westmead we marked an important milestone in every Australian adult’s life: The first property purchase.
Jiva’s search for a flat had ended here in a suburb of Sydney, one the most expensive cities in the world — that’s also one of the world’s most multicultural urban areas. 
As the incense burned and prayers were chanted, Jiva threw flower petals in offering to the goddess. 
Looking around the room I was struck by the eclectic mix of people, a reflection of Jiva’s history as well as Australia’s. 
For one thing, a lot of us had been refugees from civil wars who resettled here, back in the days when the country’s refugee policy was not so hard-line: Iraq, Bosnia, Sri Lanka — where Jiva and his family hailed from — and Vietnam, in my family’s case. 
The rest were different kinds of migrants, like Anglo-Australians a few generations in and people like Sonal from the United Kingdom — though her Gujarati family had fled Uganda under Idi Amin. 
I saw a young woman wearing tortoise shell glasses and I couldn’t place her yet she looked familiar — until I realized I’d actually taken a photo of her and posted it to Instagram last month. 
I’d seen her speaking about illustrating a picture book at Lost in Books, a multilingual kids’ bookshop in Fairfield. She was collaborating with a writer I knew, Zarlasht, whose parents had come to Australia in the '70s from Afghanistan as Colombo Plan scholars. 
Turns out Uma was a distant cousin of Jiva’s and they’d recently found each other through Facebook.
Toward the end of the pooja, our ceremony, Jiva motioned to one of his aforementioned Anglo-Australian friends to lead a final prayer. Before starting Phil said softly to the many Hindus in the room, “Sorry for my pronunciation.” 
As he chanted fluently, one of the women kept looking at him and smiling, as though she couldn’t quite believe her ears.
Sometimes a new home includes surprises. Sometimes, so does Australia. 
Are there other Australian experiences we should be asking about for Australia Diary, our collection of reader stories reflecting Australia’s unique character? Send us your story. 
For guidance and inspiration, here are few recent entries: tales of nippers, growing up on the creek, generational angst, paying with pineapples, magical mermaid pools, lizard friends, nude beaches, music and road trips, curious lifeguards, death and kindness, plus poetry and #metoo on the work site.

ROME — Even by the Vatican’s minimal standards of transparency, doctoring the letter of a retired pope to make him seem more supportive of his successor turns out to be a bit much.
Pope Francis on Wednesday accepted the resignation of Msgr. Dario Vigano, the head of the Vatican’s communications department, after an episode of airbrushing and selective editing had prompted cries of “Lettergate” and accusations that the Vatican had spread the type of fake news the pope had recently denounced.
The resignation of Monsignor Vigano, a close aide to the pope, represented another setback in what has been a difficult stretch for the 81-year-old pontiff, who just completed his fifth year in office.
Remarks Francis made in Chile that were offensive to victims of sexual abuse focused attention on an explosive issue that has threatened to derail his papacy. The success of anti-immigrant forces in Italian elections in March seemed a sharp rebuke in Francis’ own backyard to his message of tolerance for migrants. His financial reforms have stalled, and conservatives appalled by what they consider his break with church doctrine and orthodoxy have ramped up their critiques.

“It is a rather critical moment of Francis’ papacy,” said Sandro Magister, a Vatican expert at the Italian weekly L’Espresso. He said that based on the changes made by Francis “it’s hard to call him a reformist now” and that his greatest achievement had been “in terms of church image.”
Advertisement
But it was Monsignor Vigano, who as communications director was the keeper of the pope’s image, who created the headache this time.
In an apparent effort to buttress Francis against criticism from conservatives for breaking with his predecessor’s doctrinal orthodoxy, Monsignor Vigano held a news conference last week to publicize a new series of books about the pope’s theology. At the news conference, Monsignor Vigano said he had asked Francis’ predecessor, Benedict, to “write a page or a page and a half of dense theology in his clear and punctual style” and that the 90-year-old retired pope responded instead with a “beautiful, personal letter.”
In the letter, Benedict condemned the “foolish prejudice” of critics who depicted Francis as a pragmatic pastor without theology and Benedict as an academic with his head in the clouds. Benedict added that the books helped clarify “the interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.”
Monsignor Vigano and the Vatican disseminated a photo of the letter and spun it as Benedict’s seal of good papal housekeeping for Francis. The suggestion was that Benedict had read and approved of the books. But there were some key omissions.
It turned out that the Vatican had purposely blurred the final two lines on the letter’s first page in which Benedict acknowledged that he had not actually read the books and that he was physically unable and too busy to contribute his own theological assessment of Pope Francis. Distorted though it was, at least the first page saw the light of day. In the photo, the letter’s second page sits buried under the books about Francis. Only Benedict’s signature was visible.
Monsignor Vigano, in a sort of Keystone Clergy moment, himself drew attention to the omissions in the photo when he read the missing text at Monday’s news conference. Mr. Magister, who was at the news conference, transcribed and published the remarks.
The Associated Press first drew attention to what appeared to be blurred lines in the photo of the letter. Its discovery prompted an outcry, especially among Catholic conservatives who complained that their hero, Pope Benedict, was being exploited to paper over Francis’ doctrinal deficiencies. The Twitter hashtag #releasetheletter went viral. The Catholic Herald, a Catholic publication, ran the headline “Blurred Lines: Vatican Manipulation of Photo Becomes the Story.”

Under pressure to address what it called “presumed manipulation,” the Vatican on Saturday released Benedict’s full letter, of which almost the entire second page consisted of Benedict expressing his “surprise” that the 11-volume “Theology of Pope Francis” included a German author who, Benedict said, had targeted his teachings with “virulent” and “anti-papist” attacks. He said he was too busy to read the books and offer his assessment.
Advertisement
“I’m certain you can understand why I’m declining,” Benedict signed off.
The Vatican claimed it originally released only the portion of the letter it considered “opportune and relevant.”
But it did not look good. Especially because Pope Francis, who frequently laments journalists who fail to report the full story, released a major document in January condemning “fake news.” In the document, he said deception in the media went back to the snake in the Garden of Eden.
That was not a good ancestry for the Vatican’s communications director.
“In recent days many controversies have arisen regarding my work, which beyond my intentions, has destabilized the complex and great work of reform that you entrusted to me,” Monsignor Vigano, 55, wrote in his resignation letter.
Perhaps in an effort to compensate for the previous redaction, the Vatican on Wednesday released what appeared to be the full text of the letters between Monsignor Vigano and the pope, who had hired him as communications director in 2015.
On Wednesday, Francis wrote back to Monsignor Vigano and said, “I respect your decision and I welcome, not without some struggle, your resignation.”
The Vatican press office added that until Francis names a replacement, the communications office will be run by its second-in-command, Msgr. Lucio Ruiz. The pope asked Monsignor Vigano to stay on to advise the future director, it said.
A scandal in a communications department that had been a source of the pope’s strength, Mr. Magister said, was not a good sign for Francis’ reform agenda. “This is only the umpteenth proof of the failure,” he said.

One evening in January 2017, after she had been detained for hours in a police holding cell in Manhattan and repeatedly told to remove a head scarf that is part of her Muslim faith, Jamilla Clark began to cry. Then, she relented: She let a New York City police officer photograph her without her hijab.
As the camera flashed, Ms. Clark, 39, felt as if she were naked, she later said. Several male officers then stared at the image of her uncovered head as they stored it in a police database.
In August, Arwa Aziz, 45, endured a similar experience at a police building in Brooklyn. Police officers made her pull down her hijab for an official arrest photo as she stood in a cramped hallway with dozens of male prisoners. The police snapped photos of her uncovered head and hair from several angles. The prisoners, who saw Ms. Aziz weeping, turned away in respect as the officers looked on.
“It’s the law,” one of the officers told her.
The women’s accounts are detailed in a class-action civil rights suit filed on Friday in United States District Court in Manhattan by lawyers who argue that the New York Police Department’s policies for photographing arrestees violate the religious rights of any civilian forced to remove religious head coverings that leave the face unobstructed. It could apply to the hijab of a Muslim, the skullcap or wig of an Orthodox Jew or the turban of a Sikh.

                A class-action suit filed March 16, 2018, challenges the New York Police Department's policy of removing women's hijabs for arrest photos.            
Ms. Clark, 39, and Ms. Aziz, 45, had been taken into police custody on low-level charges of violating orders of protection that later were dismissed by prosecutors.

Yet because of local police rules that contrast with practices adopted by other law enforcement agencies around the country, including in Michigan and Minnesota, and with other state and federal governmental procedures, the images of the women’s uncovered heads can live on in New York Police Department databases.
Advertisement
Being forced to have their photographs taken without headwear violates their sense of privacy, “their sense of dignity, and their sincerely held religious beliefs,” said Albert Fox Cahn, legal director of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and a lawyer representing the women in the federal suit.
In addition to seeking damages for those affected by the photograph policy, the lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting the Police Department from following that policy.
That those photographs can be retrieved from governmental computer systems and viewed repeatedly as part of a paper court file causes “multiple iterations of the trauma,” said Mr. Cahn.
A spokesman for the city’s Law Department, Nicholas Paolucci, said, “We will review the complaint, but we are confident that the police department’s religious head covering policy passes constitutional muster. It carefully balances the department’s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos. Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.”
Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz, like many Muslims, observe their faith by keeping their head and hair covered in the presence of anyone but family. They are joined in the suit by Turning Point for Women and Families, a nonprofit based in Queens concerned about the impact of police policies on victims of domestic violence who wind up arrested.
Mr. Cahn and lawyers from the firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, who represent the plaintiffs, contend that the police practices are unreasonable and violate the plaintiffs’ religious freedom under both the First Amendment and federal law.
The issue highlights the gulf between criminal justice policy, as it has evolved over time, and the cultural and religious obligations of those in custody. As it stands now, the city’s policy explicitly says “the arrestee’s head covering must be removed” for the department’s official photograph. (A separate photograph that is not considered official, and is sometimes snapped in a station house, can be taken with an arrestee wearing a religious head covering.)

For many years, no policy existed at all, and commanders were left to their own discretion: Sometimes religious garb, like a hijab, was removed and sometimes it was left in place.

In March 2015, the Police Department tweaked its policy with an “interim order” to ensure that when photographs were taken, those opposed to removing religious headgear could be taken to a private area at Police Headquarters at 1 Police Plaza, to be photographed without the headgear by someone of the same gender.
That order has since been incorporated into the department’s Patrol Guide. Yet critics say the policy is confounding.
For one, it only deals with the treatment of civilians in those brief moments when their photographs are being snapped. The accommodations the policy calls for are not consistently practiced, critics say. And when they are, they are often conveyed as a warning by officers who tell arrestees that asking for a private photograph could lengthen the arrest processing time and lead to longer detention, said Mr. Cahn. He said Ms. Aziz took such warnings as a threat.
Even more significantly, Mr. Cahn said, the photograph policy does not address the fact that photos exist, possibly to be cataloged and disseminated in the future.
“Each time someone sees a photo of them uncovered, it feels like a new betrayal of their fundamental rights,” he said.
Indeed, when the city last month settled three separate cases brought by Muslims who said that removing their hijabs for photos violated their religious rights, it had the effect of papering over important nuances in the department’s ongoing treatment of arrestees while staying silent on whether the policy would be altered. The city gave $60,000 to each woman, but said only that doing so was “in the best interest” of all sides without elaborating.
Also, the settlements are “limited to only those people who have already come forward,” said O. Andrew F. Wilson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. “And it does nothing to help those women and men who are forced to remove head coverings in the future, or even in the past who haven’t come forward.”
Advertisement
Mr. Cahn added that for New Yorkers of different religions, the undercutting of their faith values offers government only slight benefit since many law enforcement experts believe that effective identification is not reliant on the removal of head coverings.
For driver’s licenses issued in New York, those sitting for a photo can wear hats, scarves or head coverings as long as their entire face is visible and the covering does not cast a shadow. Likewise, the State Police in New York are unaware of any case where a state trooper made an arrestee remove a hijab if their face was visible, said officials of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s administration.
Federally, the State Department has no requirement that such religious headwear be removed for passport photos. Several police departments around the country, too, see the removal of religious headwear as unnecessary.
The lawsuit says the city’s policy only “alienates and oppresses faith communities.” In interviews, Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz said their encounters with officers had eroded their trust in the police.
Robina Niaz, the executive director of Turning Point for Women and Families, said fear among Muslim women of the police was deterring them from stepping forward to report episodes of child abuse and domestic violence.
“In today’s post-9/11 climate, New York City is beset with widespread hostility toward and baseless fear of Muslim-Americans,” the suit says. “In the context of this increasingly polarized setting, it is incumbent on this city’s law enforcement to increase awareness of and sensitivity toward the Muslim-American community.”
For Ms. Aziz, a daughter of Palestinian immigrants who is married and has two adult children, her encounter with police has fed residual pain. “I just felt like I was broken,” she said. “It broke me.”

LOS ANGELES — They sold their homes and possessions, quit their jobs, and left their country — they thought for good. The Iranians, mainly members of their nation’s Christian minorities, were bound for a new life in America after what should have been a brief sojourn in Austria for visa processing.
But more than a year later, some 100 of them remain stranded in Vienna, their savings drained, their lives in limbo and the promise of America dead.
Even as the Trump administration continued to pledge help to religious minorities in the Middle East, many of whom face persecution, the United States denied their applications for refugee status in recent weeks.
“It’s unexplainable,” said H. Avakian, 35, an ethnic Armenian Christian who arrived in Austria from Iran 15 months ago and asked that his first name be withheld out of fear for his safety. “Suddenly they said, ‘Now you can’t come.’ We don’t know why.”
Advertisement
Mr. Avakian, who hoped to join his brother, Andre, in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview that he and other refugees were running out of money and descending into depression. “Most of us cannot go back to Iran; we’re in complete despair,” he said.

Returning to Iran after an attempt to move to the United States would endanger their lives, he and other applicants said, because the government would regard them as enemies of the state.
“We are afraid they will give us a sentence,” Mr. Avakian said. “They could put us in jail.”
The Iranians applied to resettle in the United States under guidelines set by a 1989 law known as the Lautenberg Amendment, which offers safe haven to persecuted religious minorities. In the group are ethnic Armenian and Assyrian Christians, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians, most of whom have relatives in the United States who sponsored them.
“We have been inundated with calls from concerned family,” said Martin Zogg, executive director of the International Rescue Committee’s office in Los Angeles, home to the largest Armenian community in the country.
The denials have drawn rebukes from religious leaders, human rights groups and lawmakers from both parties, who charge the United States with failing to live up to its promises and who say the applicants risk arrest and torture if they return home.
Refugee arrivals have slowed to a trickle since President Trump, who took office vowing to overhaul immigration, cut the number of people that the United States agreed to admit. But Mr. Trump also promised to protect religious minorities, particularly Christians, and his administration has condemned Iran’s treatment of them.
Enacted in 1989 to enable Jews and Christian minorities from the former Soviet Union to settle in the United States as refugees, the Lautenberg Amendment was expanded in 2003 to include Iranian religious minorities. Austria agreed to serve as a transit point. The applicants cannot work, attend school or receive government benefits while they wait for the United States to process their cases.
Among those denied visas in recent weeks are several elderly and disabled people. As the wait dragged on, many have had to rely on the Roman Catholic Church for lodging and medical treatment, and at least one couple is living in the guest room of the archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn.

“Some of the Iranians have already spent all the money they came with,” said Michael Prüller, the spokesman for the Archdiocese of Vienna. “Others see their means dwindle by the day.”
Iran’s Constitution proclaims Shiite Islam the official state religion. While it formally recognizes Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians as protected minorities, the government engages in “systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused,” according to the 2017 report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, which makes policy recommendations to the president and to Congress.
From 2010 to 2016, according to the report, Iranian authorities detained hundreds of Christians, raiding church services, threatening church members, and imprisoning worshipers and church leaders.

Suhaib Nashi, president of the Mandaean Society of America, said he feared for several Mandean families in the Vienna group. Like the Baha’i, Mandeans, who follow the teachings of John the Baptist, lack even the nominal protections of the Iranian Constitution and are thus particularly vulnerable to persecution and pressure to convert to Islam.
Among the Mandeans marooned in Vienna are three relatives of Peiman Khamisi of Batavia, Ill., who arrived through the Lautenberg Amendment nine years ago. In Iran, his relatives pretended to be Muslim to avoid harassment, performed religious rites in secret and were denied access to higher education, he said.
In late January, Representatives Randy Hultgren, Republican of Illinois, and James McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairmen of the House human rights commission, urged Vice President Mike Pence to expedite approvals for the Iranians.
After the denials, they called on the Department of Homeland Security to provide an explanation. “These Iranians are members of religious minorities fleeing a regime that has brutally oppressed their communities since 1979,” they said in a statement. “This being the case, they should be presumed eligible for admittance to the United States as refugees under the Lautenberg Amendment.”
According to the amendment, the government must justify a denial “to the maximum extent feasible.”

But no reason was given, at least not to those stranded in Austria, or to their relatives in the United States. One family was conditionally approved for refugee status in a March 2017 eligibility letter reviewed by The New York Times. Last month, they were given an ineligibility notice that said their application “has been denied as a matter of discretion.”
A spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security agency that adjudicates the cases, declined to explain why the family was denied, saying only that “these individuals were subject to the same rigorous process for resettlement as all refugees.”
Applicants are vetted before they apply for an Austrian transit visa. Once in Vienna, they continue the screening process, pass interviews with Homeland Security and undergo medical exams. Typically, it takes a few months to complete the process, and the approval rate is close to 100 percent.
A State Department spokeswoman said in an email that changes to the United States refugee admissions program in 2016 resulted in “a greater number of denials in the Vienna refugee program.” She did not elaborate, but other government officials said that the changes entailed enhanced vetting.
The rejections, she said, were unrelated to Mr. Trump’s executive orders barring people from several majority-Muslim countries, including Iran, from entering the country. She added that the United States, Austria and others were working together to find alternatives for the group.
Since 2003, about 30,000 Iranians have settled in the United States thanks to the Lautenberg program. In the fiscal year that ended in September, 1,275 Iranians were admitted, compared with 2,323 the previous year. Another 4,500 still in Iran have registered for the program.
Refugee resettlement officials said that evangelical Christians, who make up more than 90 percent of the Lautenberg pool and hail mainly from Ukraine, continue to arrive as usual.
Some of the Iranians have begun to file appeals with the help of the International Refugee Assistance Project, a nonprofit in New York.

Goharek Garmemasihi, an ethnic Armenian Christian in Los Angeles, said that she had sponsored her brother, sister-in-law, niece and nephew. Within months of arriving in Vienna last year, the parents and their teenage daughter were approved. American authorities informed them that their son, then 22, was still under review. “They decided to wait together,” Ms. Garmemasihi said.
Fourteen months passed without any word.
In September, officials persuaded the parents and daughter to leave for the United States, assuring them that their son, a 23-year-old university student, would follow soon, according to Ms. Garmemasihi and her nephew, who spoke from Vienna on the condition that he remain unnamed out of fear for his safety.
About 10 days ago, he was notified of the denial. “It was the worst day of my life,” he said through tears.
He said an appeal, which he just filed, was his last hope.
“I wish this nightmare ends, that I can open my eyes and see my family,” he said. “I just want to be with them again. I don’t care what it takes.”

HEIDELBERG, Germany — In the summer of 1954, 25,000 West Germans gathered in Düsseldorf’s Rheinstadium to hear “America’s Pastor,” Billy Graham. Two hundred trombones and a 1,300-person choir roared Protestant hymns before Mr. Graham preached with his signature verve and altar call, inviting repentant hearts to come forward and accept Christ as their personal savior. Hundreds did. A few days later, so did hundreds more, when Mr. Graham preached to 80,000 people in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. Mr. Graham returned to West Germany the next year for an even bigger tour, and then again in 1960, 1963 and 1966.
The German press nicknamed him “God’s machine gun” for his aggressive, staccato preaching, but the name also fit for deeper reasons. Mr. Graham described these trips as “crusades” and saw West Germany as ground zero in what he called “Battleground Europe,” a Cold War fight to redeem the “land of Luther” from its Nazi past and secure its future as a stronghold for American-style democracy, capitalism and evangelicalism.
In the wake of Mr. Graham’s death on Feb. 21, the world is once again debating his titanic legacy. But few have noted his significance as a global actor who preached on every continent save Antarctica. Some have decided that Mr. Graham was “the last nonpartisan evangelical” while others have condemned him to “the wrong side of history,” both in reference to American domestic politics. But Billy Graham’s culture wars are inseparable from his role as an international Cold Warrior. He wasn’t just America’s pastor; he was God’s Cold War machine gun.
Mr. Graham insisted that his German crusades were apolitical, but his sermons suggested otherwise. In Berlin’s Olympic Stadium, he elevated the city’s geospiritual significance in an emerging world order. “Berlin is prayed for in the world more than any other city,” he declared, calling the city “a battleground, a continent for conquest” — not for earthly power, as the world wars had been, but a new battle “for the hearts and minds of the people.”
In so many words, Mr. Graham was talking about the Communists. Amid rising Cold War tensions and debates over German remilitarization, he affirmed that West Germans were his “brothers in arms” literally as well as spiritually. To strengthen a Christian democratic West against a godless Soviet East, he cast his weight behind German rearmament.
He spoke for most Americans, but also for leading politicians like President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany. Adenauer made a point of meeting with Mr. Graham in 1963 as he steered his country westward. In the aftermath of the war and the American-led Marshall Plan for Europe’s reconstruction, ordinary West Germans experienced Americanization in various forms, and for many, Mr. Graham portended a similar Americanization of German religion with its emphasis on conversion and its use of modern communication technologies for evangelism. Mr. Graham’s crusades offered German Protestants the chance to experience these modern, American religious developments. Many looked to Mr. Graham not only as a promise against secularization, but also as a means of aligning themselves with the West.
Though his German Crusades were astoundingly well-attended and supported by leaders like Adenauer, they also met with plenty of criticism. Some Germans deemed Mr. Graham a Hollywood huckster who, as the German news media put it, “advertised the Bible like toothpaste and chewing gum.” Others sensed an unnerving parallel between his mass gatherings and Germany’s fascist past. The June 1954 issue of Der Spiegel featured Mr. Graham on the cover with mischievous eyes and a mouth pursed in what could be a sales pitch as much as a sermon. The magazine’s feature was disparagingly titled “Religion for Mass-Consumption,” and argued that Mr. Graham’s real goal was to steer souls away from Communism more than toward God. Unsurprisingly, the East German press was even more critical, one paper characterizing the crusades as tools of “American propaganda in the psychological Cold War.”
Liberal Protestants in the United States and Germany felt themselves caught in the middle of Mr. Graham’s bifurcated world. While prominent theologians like the German Lutheran pastor Martin Niemöller and the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr supported Germany’s democratization, they protested Mr. Graham’s equation of Christianity with America, anti-Communism and free-market capitalism. If many mainline protestants had used similar language in the immediate aftermath of World War II, by the mid-1950s they had departed drastically from seeing socialism as anathema to Christianity. Mainline liberals accused Mr. Graham of raising international tensions by identifying Berlin as the beacon of the West in a sea of Communist red. His call for spiritual armament risked a new military conflict.
After the Watergate scandal, Mr. Graham withdrew from political debates and returned to his early focus on simply “preaching the gospel.” Yet his role in provoking a global debate about the shape of democracy, capitalism, nationalism and secularism in the modern world remains one of his lasting legacies. If the Cold War is gone and the evangelical culture wars have lost much of their steam, we remain ensconced in similar debates today, and — despite recanting his theopolitics in the end — the alliances that Mr. Graham forged and the battle lines he drew have endured. In this respect, God’s Machine Gun was tragically prophetic of our modern world.

As one of world Christianity’s most admired leaders, the Rev. Billy Graham, who died on Wednesday at 99, had extraordinary opportunities to affect the character of the Christian religion and to pronounce on its implications for personal conduct. He scored at the top of lists of “most respected” Americans decade after decade. He was loved by millions in the United States and abroad.
But the parochial terms on which Mr. Graham preached Christianity render his career largely a story of missed opportunities. He too often stood aloof from or actively discouraged efforts to revise traditional Protestantism to make it more respectful of the world’s racial and cultural diversity and of the findings of modern science and scholarship.
Mr. Graham led his followers to seek comfort in versions of Christianity familiar to his core constituency, the white population of the Southern, formerly slave-holding region of the United States. He offered only weak challenges to the prejudices and injustices largely tolerated by that population.
When he heard President Richard Nixon utter prejudiced remarks about Jews, for example, Mr. Graham could have challenged him. But as audio tape of their private conversation has revealed, he did the opposite, assuring Nixon that the many Jews who befriended him “don’t know how I really feel about what they’re doing to this country.”
Many of Mr. Graham’s more theologically liberal contemporaries drew upon the words of Jesus of Nazareth and the Apostle Paul to support legislative and court actions to advance civil rights. But he chose to represent anti-black racism as a sin of the individual human heart rather than a civic evil to be corrected by collective political authority.
To his credit, Mr. Graham made a production of racially integrating his revivals and rallies at a time when many white Southern Protestants found this step provocative. But again and again he failed to contest the prevailing view that religious advocacy for civil rights was “meddling” with politics while acceptance of the inherited structures of inequality in the Jim Crow South was not.
The same pattern emerged in Mr. Graham’s approach to Christian witness in the world beyond the United States. He supported a fundamentalist reading of the Bible in the mission fields of Africa and Asia, while more ecumenical groups like the World Council of Churches promoted less sectarian versions of Christianity and less conversion-centered modes of interaction with the peoples of the globe.
There is no more perfect emblem for Mr. Graham’s global legacy than the 2003 declaration of his son and designated spiritual heir, the Rev. Franklin Graham, that President George W. Bush’s decision to go to war in Iraq presented Christians with a great opportunity to convert the population of Iraq from the “wicked” religion of Islam.
Liberal Protestant and Catholic leaders have long articulated and ably defended many variations on the old faith that accommodate what modern science and scholarship have discovered about our world. But Mr. Graham, who could have done the same, acquiesced in the provincial suspicions of modern intellectual life — suspicions that keep millions of the faithful away from an honest engagement with the Darwinian revolution in natural history and with historical and archaeological findings about the origins of the Bible as a human document. Never was the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr more right than when he warned in 1957 that Mr. Graham promoted childlike religious emotions and obscurantist ideas.
Mr. Niebuhr presents a revealing contrast to Mr. Graham. Mr. Niebuhr was a key leader of the so-called Protestant establishment, the complex of liberal, ecumenical denominations that dominated the public face of Christianity in the United States until the 1970s. Mr. Graham was the most conspicuous leader of the rival, evangelical Protestantism that gradually but decisively seized control of the symbolic capital of Christianity from the Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Lutherans and other mainstream groups within the Protestant establishment.
From the 1970s onward the Grahams of American religion triumphed over the Niebuhrs, largely because the evangelicals continued to espouse a cluster of ideas that remained popular with the white public while the liberal, ecumenical leadership abandoned these same ideas as indefensibly racist, sexist, imperialist, chauvinistic, homophobic and anti-intellectual.
Prominent among these ideas was the assertion that the United States was a “Christian nation,” rather than one in which persons of many faiths, and of no faith at all, were civic equals. Another such idea was that claim that the heterosexual, nuclear, patriarchal family was God’s will. Yet another was that faith in Jesus was the only road to salvation.
Mr. Graham had a choice as to where he would urge his followers to come down on these issues. Consistently, he distanced himself from the efforts of ecumenists to revise Christianity in cosmopolitan directions. He encouraged his vast and devoted following to believe that God’s word was unchanging and that liberals were substituting their own ideas for those of a supernatural, unchanging deity revealed in the Bible. He dumbed down his inherited faith instead of helping it to address the challenges of modern times.
The memory of Mr. Graham is rightly honored by those who shared his values and the goals for which he mobilized evangelical Christianity. But the rest of us can surely be forgiven if we remember him differently.

It’s difficult to overstate the influence of the Rev. Billy Graham — who died at 99 in his Montreat, N.C., home on Wednesday — on American public life, and indeed the world, over the past century. It’s estimated that the globe-trotting preacher shared the Christian message with 215 million people in more than 185 countries, an effort that resulted in millions of conversions. Life magazine once listed him as one of the 100 most important Americans of the 20th century, and a Ladies’ Home Journal survey once ranked him as a top figure in “achievements in religion” — second only to God.
But Mr. Graham’s legacy stretches beyond his public influence to his personal integrity. He wasn’t a huckster, which is why you’d be hard pressed to find anyone who would speak ill of the man even before his passing.
Mr. Graham died in the house where he lived for decades and was known for wearing modest attire. He lived without a hint of scandal — notoriously faithful to his wife, Ruth — and, according to a biography by Roger Bruns, “his personal finances and that of his organization have been impeccably honest.”
But perhaps most relevant to our current moment, Mr. Graham found a way to exert influence in the public square while remaining nonpartisan. He met with every president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. He read the Bible with Dwight Eisenhower and prayed with Gerald Ford, and is credited with the spiritual rebirth of George W. Bush.
As a student of American Christianity, I’ve always been fascinated by Mr. Graham’s ability to engage the public square without losing sight of himself or his calling. Which is why I asked him about these experiences during a visit to his Montreat home seven years ago almost to the day.
The cabin is tucked away on a country mountain road and impossible to find without GPS. The famous front porch was just how I’d imagined it, adorned with worn wooden rockers and aging flowerpots. Upon arrival, Mr. Graham’s aide instructed me to speak loud and talk slowly.
Mr. Graham sat in a small living room with a stacked-stone fireplace. His daughter Virginia Graham Tchividjian, known as Gigi, was also there. I approached to shake his hand, but his kind eyes greeted us before his fingers could.
“It’s such an honor to meet you,” I said.
“No, no,” he replied. “This is my honor. I’m so happy you took the time to stop by.”
A young woman dressed in scrubs brought a tray of ice tea as we circled Mr. Graham. I asked him questions about ministry, death, his wife and his experiences with presidents. Eisenhower was the most spiritual president, he said, but he felt closest to Reagan, who still showed up in his dreams from time to time.
After listening to stories for almost an hour, I worked up the nerve to ask my most important question.
“You’ve been talking about your time with the presidents,” I said. “I’m struck by the way you’ve been able to offer yourself as an encouragement, a resource and a truth-teller to leaders from both parties. A lot of young people like myself today have witnessed how many Christian leaders got lost in the partisanship and the power that accompanies politics. What advice could you offer to a new generation of Jesus-followers? How can we be more like you?”
Mr. Graham gathered his breath, his eyes searching the ceiling for the right answer.
“First, I’d say, don’t try to be like me, because I didn’t always get it right,” he said. “But also, with one exception, I never asked to meet with them. They always asked to meet with me.”
It was a staggering admission and one that, looking back, I can’t imagine coming from the many preachers and religious opportunists who now elbow their way to our current president’s side. Mr. Graham never sought out presidents or those with political power, and he refused many of the requests they made of him throughout the years.
In fact, Mr. Graham was often critical of the conservative Christian right. When he was asked in 2007 why he never affiliated with Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority, Mr. Graham replied: “I’m all for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the Panama Canal or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. I haven’t been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future.”
His criticism of the religious right for its narrow agenda and raw thirst for power seemed harsh then, but observers of the partisanship among evangelical leaders today might call them prophetic.
Any reflection on Mr. Graham’s legacy would not be complete without mention of his flaws. He was a man, not a god, and made many mistakes — even in wielding public influence.
After a 1950 meeting with President Truman, Mr. Graham knelt on the White House lawn at the request of the press corps. He later admitted regretting this public display. But one of his greatest regrets was his close friendship with President Richard Nixon, a consummate politician who used his relationship with the preacher as political leverage. He later realized his mistake, avoiding Washington and the White House altogether.
“I came close to identifying the American way of life with the kingdom of God,” Mr. Graham later told Christianity Today. “Then I realized that God had called me to a higher kingdom than America. I have tried to be faithful to my calling as a minister of the Gospel.”
His daughter chimed in with a story of her own. She recounted an event in 1998 during Bill Clinton’s impeachment scandal when most conservative Christians were doing all they could to unseat him. Around this time, Mr. Graham had been invited to attend a dinner for everyone who had been on the cover of Time magazine, and he took Ms. Tchividjian with him.
“The Clintons were there even though they were going through a difficult time in their marriage,” she said. “Daddy and I tried to be so gracious to them over dinner, but some people couldn’t believe we’d do that because they didn’t agree with the Clintons’ politics. But Daddy always taught us that we are to love, the Holy Spirit convicts, and God judges. The problem is that some Christians try to do all three.”
Today, when Mr. Graham passed from this life into the next, we lost perhaps the last true evangelical statesman. Filling the space he vacated is a new crop of religious leaders who would do well to live as Mr. Graham did — resisting the pull of partisanship, standing courageously in the middle; speaking with love and mutual respect for those who claim other parties; clinging to the Gospel, but not in a way that marginalizes listeners based on their political affiliations.
America’s preacher has left us, and we need him now more than ever.

FU’AN, China — For nearly four centuries, a swath of farming and fishing villages on China’s southeast coast has survived as a stronghold of Catholicism, sometimes flourishing, other times withering, its fate often dependent on decisions or conflicts far away in Beijing or Europe.
Now, a new clash is resonating in this rural region, known as Mindong. This time, it centers on talks between China and the Vatican to bridge their historical differences by settling the thorniest issue dividing them: control of the bishops and priests who run the Roman Catholic Church in China.
The basic plan would give the Vatican a formal role, and possibly even veto power, in how clergy are appointed in China. That would be an unusual concession by Beijing, which is deeply suspicious of foreign interference.
In return, the Vatican may force many local communities to accept clerics appointed by China’s Communist authorities rather than popular “underground” church leaders who have resisted state control for decades.

The prospect of such an agreement has unleashed intense emotions around the globe, with critics accusing the Holy See of “selling out” loyal Catholics in China. The Vatican’s defenders, meanwhile, argue that it must compromise to prevent China’s Catholics from splintering further, especially as the government of President Xi Jinping tightens control of religion.
Advertisement
But the people most affected by these proposed changes — residents in places like Mindong — say they feel a sense of powerlessness, as if awaiting a storm that they cannot control.
Many are less concerned about disputes over the clergy than about a hollowing out of Catholic life in the Chinese countryside. Others say that the outside world’s binary view of Chinese Catholicism — of loyalist underground church members and government flunkies — misses more subtle realities on the ground.
“This is something higher-ups will decide,” said Huang Xiaofeng, 40, a shopkeeper catering to pilgrims who visit a holy mountaintop cave. “We believers just go to church and pray.”
The Vatican has already asked Guo Xijin, the underground bishop in Mindong, to yield his leadership of an estimated 70,000 Catholics to a government-appointed cleric who commands about 10,000 followers — a huge concession to Beijing.
Bishop Guo, 59, who has been a priest in Mindong since 1984, said in an interview that he was willing to accede if it helped heal the long split between the underground and government churches.
But he added that it would not address larger problems that are diminishing Catholicism here. “The main problem is believers’ educational level and spiritual foundation,” he said. “They have belief, but there is no depth to it.”
Bishop Guo was referring to the fact that while Catholicism is strongest in poorer, rural parts of China, the countryside is emptying out. A few decades ago 80 percent of Chinese lived in rural areas; today only half do.
In areas like Mindong, that has meant a collapse of churchgoing. Bishop Guo estimates that more than a third of local Catholics have left Mindong to find work elsewhere. Almost all young people are gone, leaving villages dotted with churches used only on a rotating basis by a dwindling elderly population.

Mindong’s problems reflect a larger trend. According to surveys of the official and underground churches by Anthony Lam, a researcher with the Holy Spirit Study Center in Hong Kong, the total number of Catholics in China peaked around 2005 at 12 million and has since declined to 10 million.
That makes Catholicism the smallest major religious group in China, and the only one that is shrinking — even as other faiths, especially Buddhism and Protestantism, have grown rapidly amid a nationwide religious revival.
Visitors to the Bishop Bai Cave near Mr. Huang’s shop speak constantly of these challenges. Many are migrants working in cities like Shanghai. In the days before the Chinese New Year, they come home to see their parents and visit holy sites like the cave, where a Dominican friar hid from Qing dynasty soldiers in the 1700s before being executed.
But few of them are practicing Catholics any more, and their own children are growing up without the faith. There are Catholic churches in the cities but they seldom reach out to migrants.
Lin Gang, 36, who left Mindong to open a shop in Changzhou, a prosperous city on the Yangtze River, said he rarely had time for church and that almost none of his neighbors there are Catholic.
“If we could get off Sundays for Mass it would be easier,” he said. “But I have to keep the store open to take care of my family.”
“One’s faith grows weaker when one goes out to work,” he added.
The roots of the church’s problems in China go far back. The Qing emperor banned Christianity for about a century before Western powers forced the dynasty to let missionaries in again. When the Communists gained control of China in 1949, Catholicism was hit especially hard because of the Vatican’s strident opposition to communism.

The new government also expelled most foreigners from China, decapitating the Catholic Church, which had relied on foreigners to run its schools, orphanages, seminaries and religious orders. Catholicism survived as a clan-based, rural religion without its old missionizing impulse.

In 1957, the authorities added to the church’s problems by setting up the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association to replace the Vatican in appointing the clergy and give Beijing’s atheist leaders control over the church.
Many worshipers resisted. They boycotted the government church in favor of underground churches led by clergy members whom they elected. Over time, the Vatican approved most of these locally appointed clergy. That created two Catholic lineages in China: those appointed by Beijing and those by the Vatican.
This is the rift that is the focus of the current negotiations. But the picture is more complicated than it seems.
Many government-appointed bishops, for example, have quietly received the Vatican’s blessing. And Pope Benedict XVI said in 2007 that loyal Catholics could worship in Chinese government-approved churches.
Even the term “underground” is largely a misnomer now. Although some clergy have been detained and face harassment, others mostly operate in the open. In many places, underground Catholics have built their own churches, sometimes huge cathedrals, without government interference.
Bishop Guo, for example, lives in a seven-story residence next to a twin-spired church clad in white tiles. Mindong is dotted with dozens of these churches, many of them with soaring spires, chapels, residences and nunneries, all of them technically illegal.
Moreover, many of the churches received construction permits with the help of Zhan Silu, the government-appointed bishop to whom the Vatican has asked Bishop Guo to cede his position.
Bishop Zhan declined to be interviewed, but local Catholics say he signed off on the permits to reach out to underground believers.

“It shows it’s not underground at all,” said Eugenio Menegon, a professor of history at Boston University, who wrote a book on Catholicism’s deep roots in Mindong. During his time in the region, he said, he found that the unofficial clergy often gets along fine with the local authorities.
Tensions arise when one side pushes the other. Recently, the pressure has come from Beijing, which has adopted new regulations that are meant in part to curb underground churches.
The Vatican’s desire to have Bishop Guo step aside in favor of Bishop Zhan also worries residents. Many feel they should be consulted on the appointment of their spiritual leader — an issue that could come up in other Chinese dioceses where the future of as many as 30 underground bishops is uncertain.
One lay nun whose order has deep roots in Mindong said Bishop Zhan would have difficulty running the diocese because most worshipers are in the underground church and support Bishop Guo. Still, she said that if the Vatican recognized Bishop Zhan, she would obey.
Though weakened by migration and buffeted by change, Mindong remains a place where one can still sense the world of the Dominican friars who first brought Catholicism to these hilly shores in the 1630s — and the powers of faith that can outlast politics.
Not far from Bishop Guo’s cathedral is Shangwan Village, the burial site of a Catholic priest named Miu Zishan who was persecuted by Communist zealots in the 1960s and died shortly after.
In front of his grave, Wu Saiqing, 49, was sleeping on a stone bed. Locals believe that doing so cures illnesses, and so Ms. Wu was there for a midday nap, hoping to improve her health.
Ms. Wu said her family’s Catholic roots dated to the 17th century. Two of her siblings serve the official church, one as a nun and one as a priest. But she attends an underground church.
“It makes no difference to me,” Ms. Wu said. “It is the Lord we believe in.”

On Feb. 1, the same day that new repressive regulations of religion went into force in China, the Vatican took a deep bow before Beijing. After long resisting, it finally agreed to recognize several hack bishops designated by the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.), even sidelining two of its own long-serving appointees for the occasion.
Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, the outspoken, blogging, 86-year-old retired archbishop of Hong Kong, had recently flown to Vatican City to personally plead the case of the two bishops to the pope himself. How nettlesome. He was shoved off, and has since been called an “obstacle” to a deal between the Vatican and Beijing.
The reasons the Holy See is caving to the (atheist) Communist government are not entirely transparent, but it appears to be hoping for a historic thaw. Diplomatic ties were severed in 1951, not long after the Communists came to power in China, and relations have since been testy at best.
Catholics in China are thought to number between 9 million and 12 million today, with about half of them adhering to underground congregations loyal to the pope in Rome and refusing to recognize a state-sanctioned version of the Church called the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association or, more informally, the “patriotic church.”
One major conflict between the two governments has been the method for appointing bishops: Traditionally a prerogative of the papacy, Beijing has steadily tried to usurp it in China. The deal that the Vatican currently seems to be seeking would likely formalize some joint vetting procedure.
The Vatican justifies its conciliatory stance toward Beijing as an attempt to overcome the schism that has divided the Catholic community in China for nearly seven decades — as “a balm of mercy,” it has said, for the pain caused by the barriers that have prevented Chinese Catholics “from living in communion with each other and with the Pope.”
Rapprochement could also give the pope, nominally at least, ultimate authority over all the Catholics in China — a standing, however symbolic, that may well matter to a Vatican that is losing ground to other Christian denominations among Chinese converts.
The total population of Christians in China has grown considerably, from about 4 million in 1949 to perhaps as many as 100 million today. In relative terms, however, Catholics are falling behind. By some estimates, whereas Catholics in China outnumbered Protestants by 3 to 1 in 1949, today Protestants outnumber Catholics by 5 to 1.
A major explanation for the increasing differential is that the Roman Catholic Church wields not only religious and moral authority, but also political and diplomatic power.
The Catholic Church has a relatively unified command structure, a well-defined ideology and a disciplined organizational backbone. It has global reach and mass appeal, commands great loyalty and has long demonstrated the ability to survive and expand, all on the merits of peaceful soft power. In each of these ways, it rivals, perhaps even bests, the C.C.P.
And so, naturally, the C.C.P. sees Chinese Catholics’ allegiance to the pope as a direct challenge to their allegiance to the party. Vatican City is also, still, among the 20 states, all small, that recognize Taiwan diplomatically.
Many Protestant churches, although deemed suspect as well, are on better terms with the C.C.P. After a visit to Beijing in 1983, the archbishop of Canterbury gushed about liberalization in China and reportedly praised the emergence of “a church with Chinese characteristics.”
Like his predecessor, the current Anglican archbishop overseeing Hong Kong and Macau is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a body including luminaries that supposedly advises the C.C.P. but often promotes the party’s interests informally or clandestinely. Both men have tended to support Beijing’s restrictive reading of democratic freedoms in Hong Kong and opposed the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement of 2014.
Representatives of other faiths have gone further. A vice president of the Buddhist Association of China called President Xi Jinping’s speech to the Chinese Communist Party’s 19th Congress last fall, “the Buddhist sutra of the current age.” Buddhists in China — who are variously said to number between more than 100 million to more than 240 million — have been treated with a relatively light hand by the party, at least if they are not of the Tibetan kind.
Yet even if brown-nosing seems to pay off, the Vatican’s appeasement of the Chinese government would have great downsides, for itself and for the rest of the world.
By recognizing China’s so-called patriotic church, the Vatican could harm the wholesomeness of Catholic teachings in the country. Sermons given in government-sanctioned churches already have been known to exclude passages of the Bible deemed politically subversive (like the story of Daniel) or to include Communist Party propaganda.
Millions of faithful Catholics in China might also soon feel abandoned, perhaps even betrayed, after having suffered decades of oppression. Worse, the government, emboldened by the deal, could well come down even harder on them. In fact, the religious regulations that recently came into effect include much stiffer fines on underground churches and penalties for public-school teachers who give Sunday-school lessons on their own time.
And then, rapprochement might augur the Vatican’s readiness to eventually stop recognizing Taipei and instead recognize Beijing as truly representing China. Such a shift would alter the delicate balance of power across the Taiwan Strait, as well as harm Taiwan’s vibrant democracy. It would also confer legitimacy — and with the pope’s imprimatur! — on authoritarian regimes throughout the world that crack down on churches and sects.
The Catholic Church already has a checkered record dealing with fascist or totalitarian states. Pope Pius XII was criticized for betraying the Jews of Europe during World War II: Hewing to what he described as a position of neutrality between the Nazis and the Allies, he never denounced Hitler’s Final Solution. After Soviet forces violently repressed the Hungarian uprising in 1956, the Vatican sidelined the outspoken anticommunist Archbishop József Mindszenty in favor of a deal with the new puppet regime.
The Vatican’s eagerness to play catch-up in China today may do it no favors either.
Beijing doesn’t have much of a reputation for honoring commitments. Just look at its application of the “one country, two systems” arrangement it promised Hong Kong, which was supposed to guarantee the city a large degree of autonomy until 2047.
Even under the deal the Vatican seems to want, the Chinese government could eventually come to control the Catholic Church in China — by, say, simply delaying nominating anyone for bishop or repeatedly rejecting candidates presented by the Vatican until all the bishops previously selected by the pope have retired or died out. Bishops ordain priests and so without bishops, in time there could be no priests, or very few, and Catholicism in China would have died a silent death.
Four decades ago, when a destitute China was emerging from deep Maoism, Western companies got tipsy at the mere notion of selling deodorant to two billion Chinese armpits. Now that average Chinese have much more disposable income, major international corporations are willing to hand over proprietary technology, stoically endure violent xenophobic outbursts and take on members of the Chinese Communist Party as senior managers rather than risk losing out on the business prospects.
No one, it seems, can resist the lure of the great market of China, for deodorants, cars — or congregants. Not even the Vatican.

In the fall of 2014, Oprah Winfrey ran a “transformative two-day live event,” a traveling roadshow that was held in eight cities around the country. For this interactive revival-tent experience, she was joined by her “handpicked life trailblazers,” authors and personalities whose work she considered essential for the theme of the roadshow, “The Life You Want.”
The trailblazers included, among others, Iyanla Vanzant, a spiritual teacher of New Thought, a 19th-century movement with links to Christian Science that emphasizes the idea of God as “infinite intelligence” and the human capacity to think our way toward godlike power … Rob Bell, an erstwhile evangelical megachurch pastor who has reinvented himself as an itinerant preacher of the vaguest sort of Christianity … Elizabeth Gilbert, author of “Eat Pray Love,” the megaselling memoir about finding religious ecstasy in India (as well as great pasta in Italy and a hot romance in Bali) … Mark Nepo, the poet-philosopher author of “The Book of Awakening” and other tracts on the spirituality of the everyday … and of course Deepak Chopra, the aging prince of the New Age.
I list these figures and their theologies because in all the thousands of words that the political press has written about Oprah since her Golden Globes speech on Sunday night invited 2020 presidential speculation, there has not been nearly enough focus on the most important aspect of Oprah’s public persona, the crucial and fascinating role she really occupies in American life.
We’ve heard about Oprah the entrepreneur, Oprah the celebrity, Oprah the champion of holistic medicine and the enabler of anti-vaccine paranoia, even Oprah the neoliberal (don’t ask). But though she is entrepreneurial and rich, Oprah is not Jeff Bezos; though she is famous, she is not the Rock; though she has elevated various dubious approaches to wellness, she is not Gwyneth Paltrow.
Instead, her essential celebrity is much closer to the celebrity of Pope Francis or Billy Graham. She is a preacher, a spiritual guru, a religious teacher, an apostle and a prophetess. Indeed, to the extent that there is a specifically American religion, a faith tradition all our own, Oprah has made herself its pope.
In other columns I have suggested that American culture is divided between three broad approaches to religious questions: one traditional, one spiritual and one secular. The traditional approach takes various forms (Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Orthodox Jewish) but its instincts are creedal, confessional, dogmatic; it believes in a specific revelation, a specific authority and a specific holy book, and seeks to conform itself to teachings handed down from the religious past. The secular approach is post-religious, scientistic, convinced that the laboratory and the microscope will ultimately account for everything that matters, while hopefully justifying a liberal society’s still-somewhat-Christian moral commitments along the way.
But in between secularism and traditionalism lies the most American approach to matters of faith: a religious individualism that blurs the line between the God out there and the God Within, a gnostic spirituality that constantly promises access to a secret and personalized wisdom, a gospel of health and wealth that insists that the true spiritual adept will find both happiness and money, a do-it-yourself form of faith that encourages syncretism and relativism and the pursuit of “your truth” (to borrow one of Oprah’s Golden Globes phrases) in defiance of the dogmatic and the skeptical alike.
Because this kind of faith is not particularly political, because it’s too individualistic and personalized (and comfortable with the post-Me Decade American status quo) to be partisan and programmatic, it doesn’t always get the attention it deserves from a press accustomed to analyzing everything in terms of the clash of left and right.
Not that it doesn’t have partisan tilts and colorations. Some of its manifestations are more common in conservative America — where they usually have an evangelical and commercial gloss, as with Joel Osteen and his epigones. (This red-state style of spirituality was recently co-opted, with some success, by the prosperity preacher known as Donald Trump.) Others are more common in liberal communities — where they emphasize Eastern wisdom and Lost Christianities and the New Age and Esalen-style mystical humanism. Where the spiritual worldview blurs into secularism, it’s usually claiming scientific bona fides; where it blurs into traditional religion it’s usually talking about Jesus. And Oprah herself, with her Obama-endorsing, #MeToo politics and her tendency to mix spirituality with pseudoscience, is clearly somewhat on the blue-state side of that divide …
… but only somewhat, because the divide between blue-state spirituality and red-state spirituality is much more porous than other divisions in our balkanized society, and the appeal of the spiritual worldview cuts across partisan lines and racial divides. (Health-and-wealth theology is a rare pan-ethnic religious movement, as popular among blacks and Hispanics as among Americans with Joel Osteen’s skin tone, and when Oprah touts something like “The Secret,” the power-of-spiritual-thinking tract from the author Rhonda Byrne, she’s offering a theology that’s just Osteen without Jesus.) Indeed, it may be the strongest force holding our metaphysically divided country together, the soft, squishy, unifying center that keeps secularists and traditionalists from replaying the Spanish Civil War.
Which is not to say that it’s a good force in its own right; you could fill a book (as I once tried to do) with theological and sociological arguments about what’s wrong with religious individualism, its false ideas and fatal consequences. But it clearly holds the balance of power in our cultural conflicts, and it’s hard to imagine our civic peace surviving without the bipartisan influence of its soothing faux profundities.
I know, I know: You’ve stuck around this long to find out what all this religious business means for an Oprah presidential campaign. The disappointing answer is that I have no definite idea. It could be that Oprah would cease to be a figure of the spiritual center the instant she assumed a partisan mantle, that in entering in the political fray she would automatically lose her papal tiara. Or it could be that her religious authority would make the Democratic Party far more popular and powerful, more a pan-racial party of the cultural center and less a party defined by its secular and anticlerical left wing.
It could be that she would be extremely effective in the increasingly imperial role that our presidency plays, effectively uniting throne and altar and presiding over our divisions with a kind of spirituality-drenched “mass empathy,” to quote Business Insider’s Josh Barro, that our present partisans conspicuously lack. Or it could be that by turning the spiritual center to partisan ends she would hasten its collapse, heightening polarization and hustling us deeper into metaphysical civil war.
All of these scenarios seem possible, even as the most plausible scenario remains the one where she decides being a prophetess is better than being a president and declines to run at all. But either way, the Oprah boomlet is a chance to recognize her real importance in our culture — and the sheer unpredictable weirdness, perhaps eclipsing even Donald Trump’s ascent, that might follow if our most important religious leader tries to lay claim to temporal power as well.

Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.
So runs Blaise Pascal’s famous wager. His thought is simple: If there is a God, believing in him ensures an eternity of happiness, while denying him secures an eternity of suffering. If there is no God and you believe in him, the downside is relatively minimal. Even if the chance he exists is tiny, believing is the right bet.
This argument has produced few converts, as Pascal would not have been surprised to learn. He knew that people cannot change their beliefs at will. We can’t muscle our mind into believing something we take to be false, not even when the upside is an eternity of happiness. Pascal’s solution is that you start by pretending to believe: attend church, speak the prayers, adopt religious habits. If you walk and talk like a believer, eventually you’ll come to think as one. He says, “This will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.”
But many of us recoil at this suggestion. We don’t want to lie to ourselves. Say there were a pill that would do the trick: Pop it in your mouth and you’ll be a religious believer. Someone convinced by Pascal’s argument — at least to the extent of thinking that believing is the best bet — might nonetheless refuse to take this pill. She might be repulsed by the thought of going behind her own back to acquire this belief.
Pascal seems to concede that trying to believe is a matter of wishful thinking, self-deception or self-manipulation. He thinks we should do it anyway. But I think our hope of becoming better people — whether in respect of religion, friendship or justice, or in any number of different ways — rests on the possibility that there is a more straightforward and less self-abasing way to try to believe.
Consider a thought experiment. Suppose you have a friend who doesn’t get why people listen to music, read novels or eat fine food. He watches (what you consider) trashy TV and has no ambitions as regards career or romance. Since the person I have described is someone you consider a Philistine, I’ll call him Phil. He is not depressed or irresponsible: Phil takes his job seriously (though he has deliberately chosen an undemanding one). He loves his friends and family. You don’t doubt that he is happy with what he has, but you think he could be much happier, overall, than he is.
So you attempt to broaden his horizons. You take him to national parks and fancy restaurants; you introduce him to potential romantic partners. Phil views your efforts with amusement and affection rather than with irritation. Nonetheless, he is unmoved. He finds prestige TV boring and camping uncomfortable; he has no interest in marriage or child-raising; he doesn’t see why one wouldn’t just eat rice and beans. You get frustrated with him, and you say, “You are not even trying!”
What do you want from Phil? You are not proposing that he pretend to like these things, nor that he trick himself into thinking that hiking or romance is better than he takes it to be. Rather, you want him to try to believe them to be more valuable than he has currently has reason to, in order to learn their true value. When we try to believe in this sense — with a view to learning what we aim to believe — it is a rational, transparent means of belief acquisition. I call it aspirational faith.
Like many protagonists of thought experiments, Phil is idiosyncratic. What is strange about Phil is that he seems to have transitioned from childhood to adulthood without a radical change in his tastes, hobbies or goals. For many of us, the teenage period sees the beginning of some of our lifelong passions: We start reading big novels, performing music, seeking romance, caring about our appearance, looking toward the prospect of a career. Lacking a complete grasp of the identity toward which she guides herself, the teenager must have faith in the person she’s trying to become, and in what that person cares about. Otherwise she’ll become trapped in childhood.
John Hughes’s movie “The Breakfast Club” (1985) is a classic movie of its genre precisely because it captures this feature of the teenage experience. Five teenagers from different cliques (“a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal”) bond during enforced Saturday detention. Over the hours together, they discover a common humanity that transcends the social roles into which each had been slotted.
Having made themselves vulnerable to one another, they ask themselves, in the movie’s climactic scene, whether they will acknowledge one another in school on Monday. Claire (“the princess”) answers in the negative and is consequently accused by Bender (“the criminal”) of being nothing more than what she initially seemed: “You just stick to the things that you know: shopping, nail polish, your father’s BMW ….” Claire in turn, accuses Bender of being unwilling to face the facts. She says, “I’m telling the truth.” The eventual romantic resolution of this dispute — the two characters kiss — is a cinematic way of signaling that the correct attitude to their future lies somewhere in the middle.
Claire is wrong to be so cynical: If she believes that their association was merely temporary or convenient, then what has happened between them is insignificant and each character is truly trapped in his or her pigeonhole. Consider this line from the New Yorker critic Pauline Kael’s correspondingly cynical review: “The movie is about a bunch of stereotypes who complain that other people see them as stereotypes.” Kael is not wrong that the characters are stereotypes. But the point of the movie is to give us a glimpse of them trying to be more than that.
Notice, however, that the antidote to cynicism cannot be Bender’s naïve conviction that everything is different now. A person cannot, in a day, do the work needed to transcend years of internalized stereotyping. At the end of the movie, detention ends and the five teenagers part ways with a fragile, doubt-filled faith in the connections they have forged. They have tasted enough of the value of true friendship to know that they have not plumbed its depths and are therefore liable to ignore one another in the halls on Monday morning; their attitude toward the goods of friendship is not one of possession but one of aspiration.
Lacking the grounds to conclude that they will greet one another, they can nonetheless have aspirational faith — try to believe — that they will do so. The movie suggests that it is possible to see something in the prospect of stereotype-transcending friendship without taking oneself to have seen all that there is to see. What keeps aspirational faith honest is its provisional character, the aspirant’s recognition that she still has a long way to go.
The problem with Pascal’s wager is that it is a wager, and so the stakes are fixed in advance. Betting is about winning some value you are already aware of, not learning that there is something new out there to be valued. If you set out to acquire beliefs without learning, you are cheating: gaining epistemic ground without doing epistemic work. By contrast, in the cases of aspirational faith, coming to believe that, e.g., we will still be friends on Monday, is part and parcel of a bigger project of learning to become a different kind of person. The project is intellectual, involving a change in beliefs, but it is not only intellectual — and its intellectual character is inseparable from its affective and motivational character.
Pascal may have been making a related point, to the effect that the mind does not have a monopoly on wisdom, when he famously proclaimed that “the heart has its reasons, which reason does not know.” But that sentiment, however beautifully expressed, leaves the crucial questions unanswered. Because suppose that Pascal is right, and someone’s heart has reasons that her reason does not know. Do things have to stay that way? Couldn’t her reason learn those reasons? And wouldn’t that, in turn, be her heart’s opportunity to grow?

Why is it that, according to Jesus, faith is better than proof? That’s a question I’ve struggled to answer ever since I began my pilgrimage of faith as a young man. Sometimes it seemed more pressing, other times less so. It can intensify during periods of grief and pain, when faith may not offer much consolation or even make much sense in a world that seems random and cruel.
This question is compounded during periods like this one, when faith seems to distort reality rather than clarify it, when it’s easily manipulated for low rather than high purpose and when some of those who claim to be people of faith act in ways that bring dishonor to it and themselves.
Why take a leap of faith, given all that? Insisting on a little more empirical evidence before you make the leap seems pretty reasonable.
The apostle Thomas clearly thought so. According to the Gospel of John, the other disciples told Thomas that they had seen the risen Lord, to which Thomas replied he wouldn’t believe until he put his fingers in the nail marks in Jesus’ hands and put his hand into Jesus’ side.
Fast-forward a week, when Thomas encounters Jesus, who tells him, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.” Thomas does, to which Jesus replies, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”
Not seeing and still believing is held up by Jesus as a greater thing than seeing and believing. But I’m not sure I have ever fully grasped what it is about faith that makes it precious in the eyes of God. Recently, with the help of friends — pastors, theologians, authors, fellow believers — I’ve tried to deepen my understanding on that subject.
To start out, it’s worth noting that treating Christian faith as different from proof doesn’t mean it’s antithetical to evidence and reason. Christianity is a faith that claims to be rooted in history, not abstract philosophy. St. Paul wrote that if Jesus was not resurrected from the dead, the Christian faith is “futile” and followers of Jesus are “of all people most to be pitied.”
Christians would say, in fact, that reason is affirmed in Scripture — “Come now, and let us reason together,” is how the prophet Isaiah puts it — and that faith properly understood is consistent with and deepens our understanding of reality. “Reason purifies faith,” George Weigel, my colleague at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told me. “Faith without reason risks descending into superstition; reason without faith builds a world without windows, doors or skylights.”
But faith itself, while not the converse of reason, is still distinct from it. If it seems like that’s asking too much — if you think leaps of faith are for children rather than adults — consider this: Materialists, rationalists and atheists ultimately place their trust in certain propositions that require faith. To say that truth is only intelligible through reason is itself a statement of faith. Denying the existence of God is as much a leap of faith as asserting it. As the pastor Tim Keller told me, “Most of the things we most deeply believe in — for example, human rights and human equality — are not empirically provable.”
“The supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are beyond reason,” is how Blaise Pascal put it. Something would not require faith if the proof of it was absolute. According to Philip Yancey, the author of “The Jesus I Never Knew,” “Faith requires the possibility of rejection, or it is not faith.”
Perhaps the key to understanding why faith is prized within the Christian tradition is that it involves trust that would not be needed if the existence of God were subject to a mathematical proof. What God is seeking is not our intellectual assent so much as a relationship with us. That is, after all, one of the purposes of the incarnation of God in Jesus.
Every meaningful relationship — parent-child, spouse to spouse, friend to friend — involves some degree of trust. It is better and more vivifying to be the object of someone’s trust rather than the last person standing after a series of logical deductions. That’s true for us as individuals, and it can be true for God as well.
Faith demonstrates human trust in him — and, according to James Forsyth, pastor at McLean Presbyterian Church in Virginia, which my family attends, it demonstrates that we accept God’s love for us. “There is a force within love that longs to be received,” he says.
Craig Barnes, the president of Princeton Theological Seminary, told me, “Faith is a greater blessing than proof because it gives us a relationship with Jesus. All good relationships are bound together by love. And love is always an expression of faith.” He also pointed out that proofs don’t necessarily inspire belief. Toward the end of his Gospel, Matthew mentions that some still doubted after they looked right at the risen Christ. (“When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.”)
Some of those who witnessed the miracles of Jesus eventually sought to kill him. And Judas, one of Jesus’ original disciples, betrayed him with a kiss. So sensory experience isn’t enough to compel belief and allegiance.
Our most important forms of knowledge rarely come from logic or proof, according to Cherie Harder, the president of the Trinity Forum. Citing the work of the theologian Lesslie Newbigin, she says it comes through a more personal knowledge. For example, I know my wife loves me because I know her, I know her heart, I know her character, and because I trust her. “Your knowledge of her is less about physical certainty,” Ms. Harder wrote to me, “and more about a well-placed confidence in who she is (a faith in her that is qualitatively different, and far more personal and holistic, than intellectual certainty).”
“Faith,” Ms. Harder added, “is tied to love in a way that logical deduction and reason are not. We are changed by what we love more than what we think.”
Faith can allow us to understand things in a different way than reason does, in a manner similar to what J.R.R. Tolkien meant when he said that pagan myths weren’t lies but rather pointed toward deep truths. The imagination could be integrated into reason, he believed, in a way that helped us to see reality a bit more clearly. Reason is one way to perceive reality; faith — rooted not in partisan ideology but in grace and a sense of the sacred — is another.
There’s one other difference between faith and reason. The latter can analyze things like quantum physics and modern cosmology. But what faith can do is to put our lives in an unfolding narrative in ways reason cannot. It gives us a role in a gripping drama, of which the Christmas story is one defining scene. It’s a drama that includes sin and betrayal, redemption and grace; and ultimately it gives purpose to our lives despite the brokenness and pain we experience. This may mean nothing to you, but to people of faith, it can mean everything. If God is real, perhaps it should.
It’s notable that when Thomas makes his request to Jesus, he’s not condemned. Rather, Jesus gives Thomas what he needed — in his case, proof — and in doing so makes it clear that Jesus is willing to meet us where we are. Some need proof, at least as a start; for others, faith alone is enough.
According to Christian tradition, Thomas would eventually go on to serve as a missionary in India, where he was martyred. I imagine his faithfulness had less to do with putting his hand in the side of Jesus than what transpired within his heart. His intellectual doubts gave way to calm trust. In my experience, at least, that journey hasn’t always been an easy one. For many of us, shadows of doubt coexist with faith.
To emphasize faith is not to cast out doubt. In fact, it is precisely to take doubt seriously, but also to understand the doubter more completely — not just as a reasoning mind but as a full person, possessed of a divine spark that lets us see, now and then, right through the walls we have built between faith and reason.

NASHVILLE — At least since Martin Luther nailed his theses to the church door in 1517, Christians have disagreed on what Jesus calls them to do in the name of faith. There are nearly 34,000 Christian denominations worldwide, a number that doesn’t account for American Christians — nearly one in six, according to a Gallup poll last summer — who belong to no denomination at all.
But as lively as Christian debate can be, the special Senate election in Alabama has exposed how closely conservative Christianity is now in lock step with the Republican Party. I grew up in Alabama, and I don’t doubt the sincerity of my fellow believers on the other side of the political aisle, but when faithful Christians vote for a man credibly accused of child molesting, something is terribly wrong with Christianity. (With white Christianity, that is: Black Christians overwhelmingly supported the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones.) Eighty percent of white born-again Christians voting in Alabama backed Roy Moore, and there is no skirting the damage they’ve done to their own moral standing.
The day of the election, the editor in chief of Christianity Today, Mark Galli, identified the biggest loser in Alabama: Christian faith itself. From now on, Mr. Galli wrote, “When it comes to either matters of life and death or personal commitments of the human heart, no one will believe a word we say, perhaps for a generation.”
Christianity presents a conundrum for evangelicals considering a monstrous political candidate who is also a Christian. The very foundation of our faith lies in the infinite mercy of a loving God, and it’s hard for an ordinary sinner to cast the first stone. Last year I asked an evangelical friend how she could bring herself to support a presidential candidate like Donald Trump, whose behavior is so at odds with her own. “He says he’s changed,” she said, “and I believe in God’s redemption. If I didn’t, how could I get out of bed in the morning?”
I believe in redemption myself, though if I were in charge I think I’d be looking for evidence of repentance, too. And I’d be asking why people so deeply invested in redemption also tend to be so deeply invested in sending their fellow human beings to death row. But I’m trying to understand the country I’ve found myself in since last year’s election, and these days I look hard for common ground.
It isn’t easy to find. In her new book “Moral Combat: How Sex Divided American Christians and Fractured American Politics,” R. Marie Griffith explains the divide between liberal and conservative Christians as a casualty of “the sex wars” — disagreements over women’s rights, birth control, abortion and L.G.B.T. issues. By the time the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized same-sex marriage in 2015, she writes, “the rupture between Christian antagonists in the sex wars felt irremediable: one could plausibly argue that Christianity had flat out split into two virtually nonoverlapping religions.”
What Christians need is a new right-to-life movement, one in which we agree to disagree about contentious issues of sexuality and focus instead on what we share, on what we all believe. Jesus had nothing to say about birth control or abortion or homosexuality. He did have quite a lot to say about the poor and the vulnerable, and maybe that’s a good place to start.
Surely Christians across the political spectrum believe we’re called to feed the hungry, heal the sick, protect the weak and welcome the stranger. If we can agree on that much, and if we can keep our shrieking differences from wrecking the quiet conviction of shared belief, we could create a culture of life that has a chance of transcending the sex wars. I find myself hoping for a day when conservative Christian voters can elect conservative representatives for whom feeding the hungry and caring for the sick and welcoming refugees aren’t political issues at all.
Here in Nashville, through an ecumenical program called Room in the Inn, nearly 200 congregations of many faiths take in our homeless neighbors during the winter months. Every night from November through March, volunteers arrive at the program’s base of operations downtown to pick up around 250 homeless people and drive them to area churches. Guests get a good meal, a hot shower and a clean bed for the night. The next morning they get breakfast and a sack lunch to take when another set of volunteers arrives to drive them back downtown. That night the cycle starts all over again with another set of congregations.
The other day, I found a toddler’s sippy cup lodged between the seats in the third row of my minivan. Our youngest child is 19, and we have no grandchildren. I held it, puzzled, until finally it dawned on me: My husband had taken his shift at Room in the Inn the night before, and this cup must belong to one of the homeless families he drove to our church.
Homeless babies. The very thought is enough to make a person weep.
It’s Christmas, the day Christians celebrate a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger because there was no room for his family at the inn. We owe it to that infant to do better by the babies here among us. To do better by their parents, trying so hard to keep them fed and clothed and healthy. We owe it to him to throw open our arms and the doors of our inns. “You who are hungry and hurting and alone and afraid, come inside,” we will say. “You belong here.”

NEW DELHI — Tehmina Yadav is a Muslim woman married to a Hindu man. The other night, she was hanging ornaments on a Christmas tree.
In India, a country that is about 80 percent Hindu, Christmas is becoming big business. Airlines play Christmas music, online vendors sell holiday gift baskets, and one especially enterprising young man, Kabir Mishra, rents out a contingent of Hindus dressed as Santa Claus.
“I can provide as many Santas as you want,” he said.
Sitting next to her Christmas tree at home in Delhi, Ms. Yadav said that in India, there was nothing strange about non-Christians celebrating Christmas. Indians have always observed a dizzying number of festivals regardless of religious affiliation, and even though Christians represent only 2.3 percent of the population, Christmas is recognized as a government holiday.
But as far-right Hindu groups have gained traction, India has changed. Christmas has now found itself caught in the cross hairs.

The authorities recently detained 32 carolers and the priests who went to help them. The wife of a prominent politician was excoriated online for endorsing a Christmas charity event, and earlier this month, a far-right Hindu group sent letters to schools warning them that celebrating Christmas would be done “at their own risk.” The group threatened unspecified consequences.
“We are afraid of Christmas this year,” A. C. Michael, the national coordinator of the United Christian Forum, an Indian advocacy group, said in a statement.

Shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, some officials in his government pushed a short-lived campaign to change the official recognition of Christmas to “Good Governance Day.”
It is all part of a broader ideological battle that has produced countless acts of violence and harassment across India based on religious identity.
While reflecting on decades of celebrating Christmas, Ms. Yadav expressed concern that what used to be just a fun holiday had become increasingly policed and intertwined with religion.
“Earlier on, you celebrated everything,” she said. “You kind of absorbed everybody’s culture and tradition without questioning it. Now, you don’t. Religion has become a new mantra for people.”
When British colonizers came to India, they brought Christmas with them. Sanjay Srivastava, a sociology professor at Delhi University, said the global spread of consumerism had helped popularize the holiday, especially among a moneyed Hindu elite.
But as Christmas and other Western holidays like Halloween have gained popularity, Indian cities have also become more segregated along religious lines, he said. Christmas is often celebrated by Indians looking to appear cosmopolitan, he added, but who do not necessarily see Christianity as having a “legitimate role in the cultural life of the country.”

In some parts of India this month, tensions over the holiday erupted into confrontations.
On Dec. 14, carolers affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church were assaulted by a mob in a village in the state of Madhya Pradesh. But instead of charging members of the mob with a crime, the police arrested the carolers under a law against inflaming religious sentiments.
Eight priests who went to the police station to help were also detained. Outside the station, their car was set on fire.
“We are pained, and we are shocked,” said Cardinal Moran Mor Baselios Cleemis, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India, at a news conference in New Delhi. “This incident creates further anxiety in the minds and hearts of the Christian faithful and the minorities in the country.”
Amruta Fadnavis, the wife of the chief minister of Maharashtra State, also provoked a major controversy by promoting a Christmas charity event for poor children in Mumbai. Social media exchanges became so intense that Ms. Fadnavis wrote a follow-up message on Twitter affirming that she was a “proud Hindu.”
On Monday, the Hindu Jagran Manch, a far-right Hindu group, sent letters to schools in the north Indian city of Aligarh warning administrators of repercussions if they celebrated the holiday in classrooms. The local police said they would provide security in all schools and colleges in Aligarh on Dec. 25.
A Christmas celebration in a village in Rajasthan was also disrupted on Tuesday, according to news reports, when a different Hindu group descended on a community center there, throwing away hymn books and accusing participants of trying to convert locals.
Chetan Rajhans, 34, a spokesman for the Sanatan Sanstha, a right-wing Hindu organization, said Christmas promoted a “Western culture of materialistic immorality.”
“Christmas is a festival that is not conducive to Indian culture or tradition, and it is in schools that the first level of conversion begins,” he said by telephone, referring to classroom celebrations in which Santa distributes presents and children “begin to get attracted towards Christianity.”
“We have started copying European culture in the garb of celebrating Western festivals,” he added.

But despite these contentious questions hanging over the holiday, Christmas preparations moved forward in much of the country, with vendors reporting brisk sales of Christmas-themed gift baskets, stuffed Santas and miniature Nativity scenes.
“Every year, it’s just crazy,” said Radhika Anand, who helps manage Christmas events at a big shopping center in Delhi. “It doesn’t matter if you’re not a Christian. Indians believe in celebrating.”
Sifting through costumes of the Virgin Mary for her 5-year-old daughter at a middle-class market across town, Priyanka Haldunia, 32, said that though she is Hindu, she thought of Christmas as a teaching opportunity.
“We visit a gurdwara as often as a mosque,” she said, referring to a place of worship for Sikhs. “This is a form of national integration that I want to instill in my daughter. It is very important.”
Surabhi Sukriti, 37, from Mumbai, said Christmas was so widely celebrated in her housing complex that visitors were shocked to learn how few Christians actually lived there. She and her family celebrate the holiday by baking pastries and recruiting Ms. Sukriti’s brother to dress up as Santa Claus to deliver presents to her 8-year-old son.
At Ms. Yadav’s home, Reyhaan, 13, her son, has submitted his Christmas list (a typewriter and a camera), and earlier this month, Ms. Yadav started planning the menu: a leg of ham, quiche and a cheese board. Other families said that they ate typical Indian sweets like gulab jamun, cottage cheese balls soaked in syrup, on the holiday.
Ms. Yadav acknowledged that she came from a position of privilege. She lives in a cosmopolitan neighborhood where observing three religions in one household does not provoke the same ire that it might in some Indian villages.

But she noted that the same gusto for celebrating Christmas did not necessarily extend to other holidays in her social circle.
“If you were to ask me how many of my Hindu friends even want to celebrate Eid, it would probably be zero,” she said, referring to Eid al-Adha, a major Muslim religious observance.
Minhazz Majumdar, 48, Ms. Yadav’s sister, said the growing emphasis on identity politics in India meant religion, caste and holiday celebrations were becoming increasingly used to polarize communities.
“The India we grew up in was definitely more inclusive,” she said. “It has not descended into madness totally, because there are still people who are trying to show the universality of our cultural experiences, but it’s like a pot that is on the boil.”

THOMAS HOOVEN, M.D.

DEC. 22, 2017

“I think it’s sad that you feel like you’re alone in the universe,” my mom recently said to me.
We were talking about the fact that I’m an atheist. Unspoken but understood was her dismay that my son and daughter aren’t religious, either. At ages 6 and 3, I’m not sure they’ve ever heard of God.
I was raised differently.
When I was growing up, my family attended a Protestant church in our small Connecticut town. On scarlet velvet pew cushions, I sang hymns and read scripture. In Sunday school, I imagined a God who knew everything about me and everything else.
I believed in biblical miracles: stories of walking on water, talking bushes and multiplying loaves of bread. These tales injected the possibility of imminent magic into my childhood. I assumed they were true because our white-haired minister told them with the same sincerity with which he praised honesty, generosity and other earnest virtues.
Advertisement
Church made sense to me and helped me feel safe. And then it didn’t. During my teenage years I examined what I’d heard under the glare of growing skepticism. War and tragedy filled the news, unanswered by any God I could perceive. I felt drawn to the language of biology and medicine, which — to my ears — clanged with the cadences of liturgy.
Advertisement
Eventually I became a physician and a scientist. As I passed through medical school and residency, my religious belief faded until it was gone. I’ve encountered wonders in the hospital and laboratory. A child paralyzed by botulism who sat up the morning after receiving an antibody. Complete genomes arrayed on my computer screen like books on a shelf. These achievements were the product of centuries of human thought and preparation. Where some people might see miracles, I see the fruits of reason.
“I don’t feel like I’m alone,” I said to my mom. “I’m surrounded by people I care a lot about.”
Two of those people are my children. After I became a dad, I wrestled with whether I should return to church for their sake, in order to pass along rituals that were formative during my childhood. I knew that my religious belief couldn’t be restored; it was as if I had undergone an irreversible chemical reaction. But I remembered how certain sermons — especially the miracle stories — once made the world seem more vibrant. I wanted my kids to have that experience.
I was looking for a new tradition for my young family, one with ancient origins and dazzling, interconnected forces, but without the supernatural overlay.
My wife, also an atheist, was a willing partner. Together we considered our options.
We established our own Sunday custom that checked all the boxes: science experiments instead of church.
Rather than kneeling in prayer, we might swab a petri dish with environmental samples from our living room floor. The appearance of bacterial and fungal growth over the next week astonishes my kids the way a rod turning into a snake in the Book of Exodus once astonished me. Their communion bread and wine are replaced by baking soda and vinegar, which when combined generate a satisfying volcanic eruption and the opportunity to talk about the ethereal realm of atoms. Sprouts in our windowsill herb garden offer a chance to introduce the concept of DNA. When I tell my son that the granular basil seed holds millions of chromosomes, the look on his face can only be described as revelatory.
Children, of course, are rigorous scientists. Toddlers observing something unusual respond with an attitude every researcher strives to maintain: open to many interpretations until they have decisive evidence for one.

I remember the first time my daughter saw a candle flame, staring at it with acquisitive curiosity.
“Don’t touch that, Maya,” I said. “You can’t hold fire, and it’s too hot to try.”

She gave me a skeptical look and — sure enough — leaned in to pinch the burning wick the moment I glanced away. Tears followed, but so did firsthand discovery. One experiment at a time, children test and refine their understanding of the world.
While I’m sure my kids will encounter religious ideas and stories of miracles before long, I won’t rush them there. Christmas in our house is a celebration of festive decorations and family reunion. We steer clear of the virgin birth and angelic tidings. And although my kids have heard about Santa, they express doubts that I make no effort to dispel. I don’t want to indicate that the natural laws they’ve painstakingly established are subject to occasional suspension.
When they eventually ask me about God, I’ll say that He’s part of a theory a lot of people believe, but which no one has ever proven. And if they want to go to a church, temple or mosque to learn more, I’ll gladly take them. Above all, I want them to reach their own conclusions, whatever those might be.
Some biblical passages remain foundational in my life — guidance whose poetry transcends faith. I carry them with me, and I’ll share them with my kids when they’re older.
“Who is wise and understanding among you?” asks the Book of James. “Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.”
As a dad, I’m always wishing for more wisdom, and I’m often humbled. I worry about the challenges my kids will face on our imperiled planet, and fret about how to prepare them. I would welcome divine inspiration, but so far I’ve had to rely on intuition.
I hope that when they grow up, they’ll think of our homespun science experiments as early steps in a fruitful quest for hidden truths. I know that same hope motivated my parents to take me to church, and I consider our different approaches an evolution rather than a schism. We all want to pass on to our children a durable appreciation for the intricate splendor of the universe. By introducing science into our weekend routine, I feel I’m equipping them for the future while sharing experiences that often feel sublime.
When my son explains how the moon causes the tides or my daughter speculates about what a worm sees underground, I hear them contemplating a marvelous and mysterious reality. They summon a memory from my childhood of stepping out of church into the sparkling New England afternoon, awed by the grace and grandeur of existence.
And on Sunday morning when they dash to their plastic microscope shouting, “Let’s check on our petri dishes!” there’s only one word that captures how I feel: blessed.

What is Christmas about, anyway? Can I be a Christian if I doubt the virgin birth? Can a woman become a cardinal? What would upset Jesus today? I put these blunt questions and more to Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, who was appointed by Pope Francis and is in his mold. Here’s our conversation, edited for space and clarity.
KRISTOF Merry Christmas! Let me start with respectful skepticism. I revere Jesus’ teachings, but I have trouble with the miracles — including, since this is Christmas, the virgin birth. In Jesus’ time people believed that Athena was born from Zeus’ head, so it seemed natural to accept a great man walking on water or multiplying loaves and fishes; in 2017, not so much. Can’t we take the Sermon on the Mount but leave the supernatural?
 CARDINAL TOBIN People are, I guess, free to take whatever they want. Just like there’s wisdom in non-Christian religions that Christians appropriate.
The most mind-boggling miracle is the incarnation. We believe that the Creator of the Universe, the one who existed before time and before anything else, became one of us. If you accept that, then there are a lot of other things that don’t seem to be quite as unbelievable.
It’s not a magic show. All of the miracles were not isolated or simply altruistic events. They were actually pointing toward who God is, and who this carpenter from Nazareth really was.
 One area where the Catholic Church seems to me antiquated is gender. If Jesus trusted women like Mary Magdalene, if Phoebe could be a leader of the early church, then why can’t women be priests or cardinals today?
Those are two different questions. Regarding priests, it really is a stumbling block for people, and especially in this country and in this culture, as all areas of life are opening up to women that this particular ministry in the Catholic Church is not. So I understand the consternation. I have eight sisters. I know for some women this sort of stumbling block takes them away from the church.
As for cardinals, most are bishops but not all of them. As recently as the 19th century there were lay people who were cardinals.
 So will we see women cardinals soon?
 Maybe my theology isn’t sophisticated enough, but I don’t believe that there’s a compelling theological reason why the pope couldn’t name a woman cardinal.
Pope Francis has promised to find a more incisive role for women in the church. There are isolated incidents of women being appointed to fairly influential posts in the Roman Curia. I think it’s got to be more than that.
I have huge admiration for Catholic nuns, priests and laity working on the front lines all over the world to fight poverty, disease, injustice. Those people are doing exactly what Jesus talked about. But, so often, religious leaders, including those in the Vatican, seem less focused on the needy and more on issues that Jesus never breathed a word about, like gays, or abortion, or family planning.
It’s fair to say Jesus did not make pronouncements on those three hot-button issues. I think, though, that he gave us an ethos and a moral direction, so we don’t have to sit down and say, “Jesus, what do we do?” Catholic tradition didn’t fall out of the air and decide something capricious. It’s based on all sorts of lived experience of people trying to follow Jesus closely.
  Can I ask about prayer? I accept that prayer has spiritual, healing value, but why is it that God answers prayers only in ambiguous situations, such as curing cancer, but never to, say, regrow a leg?
 It’s interesting you mention that, Nicholas. My dad grew up strong and big, played football for Boston College, went into the service and lost his leg in World War II.
One night he was looking at his prosthesis. He said: “I was thinking I’ve had that thing half my life now. But if I didn’t have that, I wouldn’t have your mother, and I wouldn’t have you.” So he discovered something in that tragedy. Faith got him through it.
Sometimes I think when I don’t receive an answer to what I’m praying for, maybe what I’m asking for actually is something that could be harmful for me. I do believe God hears all prayers, and I believe God answers in some way.
In previous Q. & A.’s, I asked Rev. Tim Keller and President Jimmy Carter whether a skeptic like myself, who admires Jesus’ moral teachings but doubts the virgin birth and any physical resurrection, counts as a Christian. Basically, Keller said “no,” and Carter “yes,” so you’re the tiebreaker. Am I a Christian?
I would think that if you haven’t completely closed the door on the possibility that God has more to say to you, then I think you’re in the tent.
 Let’s turn the tables. Anything you want to ask me?
 Can I ask a favor? I’m really worried about this country for a lot of reasons, but I’m particularly concerned about refugees and immigrants. I really think this present administration is moving clearly toward a mass deportation. My people are already terrorized. I am so afraid that unless we can find a way of changing hearts, they’re going to go ahead with it.
So is that God’s work here on earth? Is that what Jesus would be criticizing today?
I never hear Jesus going out of his way to point an accusing finger at people who are oppressing the poor. What he does criticize in very stark terms is the ones who don’t see them, who don’t see them as they are. I think that’s what happens. We’re developing a national cataract.
Thanks! And for all my skepticism, this I believe: Merry Christmas!

THE EXODUS By Richard Elliott Friedman 282 pp. HarperOne. $27.99.
THE GREAT SHIFT Encountering God in Biblical Times By James L. Kugel 476 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $30.
For more than a century biblical credibility has been fighting a rear-guard action. Evidence of human authorship, including borrowings from other ancient texts and historical anachronisms, has led some of the Bible’s readers to discredit even its central assumptions. Brave indeed is the scholar who takes up arms against this sea of skeptics.
Each of these fascinating works by renowned biblical scholars addresses a great question, one historical and the other theological. In “The Exodus,” Richard Elliott Friedman seeks to answer, once and for all: Was there an exodus from Egypt? In “The Great Shift,” James Kugel responds to the perennial Sunday school question: Why doesn’t God talk to us anymore?
Kugel’s question usually receives an answer either glib or condescending. We are told that God still speaks but that we are not listening — suggesting a serious decline in the communicative power of the Almighty as well as an obliviousness on our part that would put a texting teenager to shame. The other response is that ancient people were deluded primitives. Kugel argues that we are not dealing with a lack of information or attention but rather a difference in consciousness and in our idea of God.
Advertisement
Kugel points out that when God speaks to biblical characters, even for the first time, they are “surprised, but not exactly bowled over.” Apparently the experience is not radically different from a human encounter. (The prophet Samuel thrice mistakes God’s voice for that of his priestly mentor.) Kugel draws on Charles Taylor’s notion that the premodern self was “porous” — or as Kugel puts it, “semipermeable.” People did not experience themselves as fixed, bounded individuals, but as continuous with the natural world. When God appeared there was a “fog of divine beings,” a moment that was different from ordinary reality, but not a radical break with it. While we cannot know the experience of an earlier generation, Kugel draws on a wide range of both anthropological and neurological data, along with ancient Near Eastern texts reflecting a similar sense of self. Rather than nature being “out there,” everything interpenetrated, and hearing voices was not uncommon in a world enchanted and inhabited by spirit.
The heart of the book contains evidence from the biblical text that not only were human beings more permeable, the Deity was different too: far less abstract and distant than later conceptions. God was periodically visible, local, choosing to be accessible to select individuals at times.
Advertisement
Modern selves experience inspiration as arising from within. In ancient times the self was more a prism than a flashlight: Brilliance shone through you. Prophets and poets were touched by forces beyond themselves. In time we closed ourselves to the world and came to see souls as internal and contained, not oceanic drops.
Gradually, Kugel writes, God became more remote: “He no longer stood just over there, behind the curtain separating ordinary from extraordinary reality. … He became a huge, cosmic deity.” Eventually homespun revelations of burning bushes faded into historical memory. The direction reversed; instead of God suddenly speaking to human beings, people began to search for and speak to God. Revelation gave way to prayer.
Friedman’s work is less theological than Kugel’s and more a historical detective story. In fluent prose he insists that the Exodus did indeed happen, just not quite the way the Bible describes. (Disclosure: Friedman cites me as a skeptic of the biblical account.)
The Exodus story has both believers and doubters who press their case with vigor. On the one hand, why invent a violent, improbable drama that begins in slavery and gives a foreign origin to a people claiming a land if it were not true? On the other hand, despite numerous attempts to find evidence, settlement patterns in Israel do not reflect a large population influx at that time. The biblical number of 600,000 fleeing men (so over two million total people) would cover the entire Sinai, and neither archaeology nor Egyptian records contain anything to support the story.
Modern scholars have increasingly argued for an indigenous origin to Israel. As Friedman emphasizes, with a nod to current politics, this, if anything, establishes Israel’s roots in the land even more securely. He cites an overwhelming number of inscriptions and other evidence that make denying Israel’s ancient place in the land impossible for all but the ideologically addled. Friedman agrees with this consensus — most Israelites did originate in Israel. But not all of them.
We know that some central figures in the biblical account have Egyptian names: Moses, Aaron, Phinehas, Hophni. All eight such names, Friedman notes, belong to Levites. For it was the Levites who left. The Exodus story is really the tale of how the people we call Levites left Egypt and joined up with the Israelites already in Canaan. To support this reconstruction, Friedman relies on several converging lines of evidence.
Advertisement
Why conclude the Levites were the ones who left Egypt? Well, in the Song of the Sea right after leaving Egypt (Exodus 15), the word “Israel” is never used. Various Egyptian practices and themes appear in Levitical sources of the Bible — and none appear in the non-Levitical sources. And each — Levites and Israelites — has a distinct name for God. The name El is of Canaanite origin and was used by the indigenous Israelites before the Levites arrived. The other, Yahweh, we find in the priestly (i.e. Levitical) sections of the Bible and was brought with them. Neither is discarded; rather they are combined and both used for the God of Israel. In other words, the Levite tradition was added to the Israelite tradition and together they formed the way the people refer to God.
Friedman also argues that the Bible’s preoccupation with the stranger is not from the Israelites who, after all, already lived in Canaan. Rather it is a product of the Levite experience of wandering and eventual acceptance into the people of Israel. (“Fifty-two out of 52 references to aliens occur in Levite sources.”) If Friedman is correct that the laws about the treatment of slaves and the story of the plagues and Exodus itself are from Levite sources, we owe to the Levites some of our most humane and influential ideas.

There are challenges to Friedman’s account: Who exactly were the Levites while still enslaved in Egypt, and how did their story become central to the larger community of Israel? Why did the Israelites in Canaan accept them when they arrived? Is the sourcing of passages in the Bible correct? Without slighting these and other difficulties, Friedman makes a gripping and persuasive case that it was the Levites who escaped Egypt and carried the story of the Exodus into Canaan, teaching us one of Judaism’s foundational ethics: not to oppress the stranger because we were once oppressed.
Both books trace the gradual emergence of monotheism from a background of polytheism. (To quote Friedman at his coyest, “One won.”) Each explains the gradual unfolding of a universal God who is parent to all, who provides a paradigm of liberation and demands not just devotion but ethical action. Both authors succeed in deploying modern scholarship to prove the validity, or at least plausibility, of ancient convictions.
In Moses’ final song to the people he encourages them: “Remember the days of old / Consider the years of ages past / Ask your father, he will inform you, / Your elders, they will tell you” (Deuteronomy 32:7). They still have a tale to tell, those elders. As Kugel and Friedman demonstrate, if we learn new ways to ask, even doubting moderns can trust the power of that tale.

It’s Christmas. At this time of the year, families get together and share presents. Santa Claus makes many — especially the kids — happy. Meanwhile, not all but hopefully many people will remember what this colorful celebration is really about: Jesus of Nazareth was born in the holy city (or if you’re more partial to the carol version, “the little town”) of Bethlehem.
We know this story from the two sources in the New Testament: the gospels of Matthew and Luke. Although their accounts differ somewhat, both tell that Jesus was born from his virgin mother Mary in Bethlehem. Luke adds that Mary swaddled her newborn and “laid him in a manger.” This has become the popular narrative, inspiring countless works of Christian art depicting an infant Jesus in a barn, surrounded by docile animals.
However, the early Christian narratives about the birth of Jesus — also called the Nativity — were more diverse. And there was even another religion that offered a take on this story: Islam.
A key Christian document that diverges from the gospels of Matthew and Luke on the Nativity is the Protevangelium of James — a “Gospel” that didn’t make it into the New Testament and thus remained “apocryphal.” Its purported author is James, the brother of Jesus, but scholars think that it was written generations later, sometime in the latter half of the second century. It is called a “protevangelium,” or “pre-Gospel,” because it highlights the life of the infant Jesus, which is not discussed much in the New Testament.
In the Protevangelium, we read that Jesus was born not in Bethlehem but somewhere in the “desert” between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Mary, according to this story, went into labor while riding between the towns. Her husband, Joseph, found a nearby “cave” for her and went out to Bethlehem to find a “Hebrew midwife.” When Joseph returned with her, Jesus was born. “My soul has been magnified this day,” the midwife said, according to James’s account, “because my eyes have seen strange things, because salvation has been brought forth to Israel.”
The Protevangelium was largely unknown to Western Christians until the 16th century, but it was widely used among Eastern Christians. A powerful testimony to this is the Chora Church, a medieval Byzantine church in Istanbul, which features beautiful mosaics that reflect themes from the Protevangelium.
But there is another source that locates the Nativity in the wilderness: the Quran.
Many Christians may not be aware — especially in today’s confrontational political climate — but Islam’s scripture shows great adoration for Mary and Jesus, and tells their story in detail. Many aspects of this story are line with the New Testament: The Quran praises Jesus as the “messiah” and the “word” of God, and tells that he was born of Mary without a biological father. It narrates the Annunciation — when the angel Gabriel told Mary that she would give birth to Jesus — similarly to the Gospel of Luke.
When it comes to the Nativity, however, the Quran differs from the New Testament. Mary, the Muslim text says, “withdrew to a distant place.” This seems to be in line with the Protevangelium of James.
But the Muslim text goes on to describe a Nativity scene that isn’t found in the Protevangelium. In the Quran’s telling of the story, in the “distant place,” the pains of labor drove Mary to “the trunk of a date-palm.” A miraculous voice told her: “Do not grieve! Your Lord has placed a small stream at your feet.” Mary is told to eat from the dates of the palm tree, drink from the water and trust in God.
For centuries, Western scholars wondered where the Quranic story of Mary giving birth under a palm tree came from. Some pointed out that another apocryphal document, “The Infancy Gospel of Matthew,” also depicts Mary eating from a palm tree and drinking from a miraculous spring. There, however, the incident takes place not during the birth of Jesus but years later.
An archaeological discovery shed more light on this curious matter. In 1992, while widening a road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, the Israeli authorities uncovered the ruins of a long-forgotten Byzantine church: Kathisma of the Theotokos, or “Seat of the God-bearer.”
“God-bearer” is a title for Mary in Eastern Christianity. A common legend held that the Kathisma church was built on a rock on which Mary rested during the flight into Egypt, which, according to the Gospel of Matthew, took place after Jesus was born. But according to scholars, earlier generations believed that this was the very location where Jesus was born — in line with the Protevangelium that describes a midpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem — and with the “distant place” described in the Quran.
Moreover, a medieval pilgrim wrote about a sacred water “which came from a rock” at the church. Furthermore, archaeologists found mosaics, and one of them depicted — lo and behold — a palm tree laden with dates! Stephen J. Shoemaker, a professor of religious studies at the University of Oregon, believes “this is almost certainly a representation of the date palm from which the Virgin Mary was miraculously fed.”
What does this all mean? Does this tell us where Jesus was really born? In Bethlehem or on the road between it and Jerusalem?
We will probably never know. We have different scriptures and traditions, which tell different versions of the same story. It really depends on which, if any, you take as your guide.
But we can know something: Jesus of Nazareth must have been an amazing man. Had he been a just a Jewish carpenter from rural Galilee or one of the many militants at his time pretending to be a political Messiah, today we would not be discussing where he was born.
Jesus of Nazareth must rather have been an amazing man who, with his striking persona and fascinating teachings, captured the hearts and minds of not just his contemporaries but also many more to come. His legacy is so great that two of the world’s great religions, Christianity and Islam, sing his praises — even if they disagree on his theological nature or his exact birthplace.
So this Christmas, say, “Glory be to him,” as Christians say — or “Peace be upon him,” as we Muslims do. And either way, merry Christmas to us all!

GODA Human HistoryBy Reza AslanIllustrated. 298 pp. Random House. $28.
A word of advice to the religiously curious: Don’t trust any history of God that has only 171 pages of text. Reza Aslan’s new project, “God: A Human History,” is aimed at the analytically minded spiritual seeker, the type who hopes to answer deep questions on the divine with study data and tidbits about evolution. But instead of arming readers with interpretive tools and good questions, Aslan tells a highly selective, generalized tale with the goal of proving his own beliefs.
This fits his oeuvre. A professor of creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, Aslan wields words skillfully and speaks elegantly; his ideas are perfectly suited for the internet-video age. He has a knack for tidy arguments: He’s perhaps most famous for eviscerating a Fox News host who questioned why Aslan, a Muslim, would want to write “Zealot,” his 2013 book about Jesus. Aslan may well be the most talented religious translator of his generation. But in his primed-for-television sureness, he misses an opportunity to engage the many Americans who are searching for new ideas about God. Rather than cherishing the complexity of belief, he chooses spiritual arrogance.
The idea of the book is fairly simple: Human spirituality can be explained in one cohesive, linear story about our universal desire to see ourselves in God. Aslan is skeptical of religion, which he sees as “little more than a ‘language’ made up of symbols and metaphors.” He’s more interested in “the ineffable experience of faith,” which for him is “too expansive to be defined by any one religious tradition.” While he claims he’s not interested in proving or disproving the existence of God, by the end, his metaphysical commitments become clear. He believes God is universal, present in everyone and everywhere, and no more capable of making moral demands on humanity than any person. “The only way I can truly know God is by relying on the only thing I can truly know: myself,” Aslan writes. It doesn’t matter whether people believe in God or not, he implies. “We are, every one of us, God.”
This mix of humanism and pantheism guides Aslan’s narrative choices. He structures the book as a linear progression of faith, moving from animism, or the attribution of a soul to all objects, to monotheism, or the belief in one God. He’s deeply interested in the origin of religious impulse, settling on an evolutionary theory: When ancient hunter-gatherers saw gods in the world around them, they were just trying to detect threats, looking for signs of humanlike beings with the ability to harm. An intuitive belief in the soul is “humanity’s first belief,” Aslan writes. We are wired to see the divine.

As human civilization evolved, so did people’s worship of humanlike gods, Aslan says. People began to see themselves as “rulers of nature, gods over the earth,” he argues, which led to the development of agriculture. Ancient civilizations revered their ancestors and pantheons of gods with human traits; emperors and kings lifted specific gods to rule others in their image. While monotheism emerged in fits and starts, Aslan writes, it finally took hold among the ancient Israelites. He goes on to summarize the first 600 years of Christianity in 17 pages, bringing religious history to its culmination in Islam, “a kind of doubling down on the very concept of monotheism.”

It’s a convenient story for an author arguing that a single, universal theory can adequately summarize thousands of years of contested history, text and myth. Aslan shows little interest in religious traditions that don’t fit this pattern, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, which are mentioned only in passing. His history of God barely travels east of the Arabian Sea.

Instead, Aslan bushwhacks his way through intellectual history in pursuit of his point. Émile Durkheim, one of the most important early sociologists of religion, is taken down in two paragraphs. Aslan is clearly bothered by what he sees as theological inconsistency, dismissing the Christian notion that God’s Trinitarian nature is a mystery and Muslims who don’t grapple with the “paradox” of attributing human qualities to Allah, who is supposed to be distinct from creation. Each successive religion has rendered earlier forms irrelevant, he suggests, ultimately leading to the universalistic revelation he delivers in his book.
Aslan finds this expressed in the mystic tradition that “revitalized Islamic theology in the face of orthodox rigidity,” known as Sufism. “At last,” he writes, “we arrive at the inevitable endpoint of the monotheistic experiment … God is not the creator of everything that exists. God is everything that exists.”
It’s a slippery play. Aslan self-identifies as a believer, but acknowledges that someone might as well think everything from the Big Bang to the balance of mass and energy “is all just an accident of atoms.” After this whole glib race through the history of religion, it turns out Aslan has no taste for religious particularity: textual debates that can animate a lifetime; ritual practices bound by sacred law; theological concepts that are specific to one tradition, rather than common to all.
Aslan spends much of his public life defending Muslims against bigotry, including comments by New Atheists such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. But ironically, he seems to share some of their intellectual biases. Like Aslan’s CNN series, “Believer” — canceled in June after he wrote a foul-languaged tweet about President Trump — “God: A Human History” is aggressive atheism tempered and remodeled for the millennial age: doggedly universalistic, obligation-free and relentlessly focused on self-revelation. While Aslan claims to walk alongside the seeker, his orientation is actually the opposite, forgoing humility and spiritual hunger in favor of simplicity and self-righteousness.
Readers searching for God in Aslan’s history will most likely be disappointed. But in this, there’s a hidden blessing. Unlike Aslan’s search, theirs will continue once the book is done.

MARTIN LUTHER The Man Who Rediscovered God And Changed the World By Eric Metaxas Illustrated. 480 pp. Viking. $30.
Eric Metaxas is exceedingly bold, for writing a biography of Martin Luther has always been a great challenge. To begin with, becoming a Luther expert requires a lot of reading. Jaroslav Pelikan, the eminent church historian who served as an editor of the American edition of Luther’s Works, often warned his students that more books had been written on Luther than on any other figure in Christian history, save for Jesus Christ. Add to this colossal bibliography the scores of huge tomes filled with Luther’s own writings in German and Latin, and the effort required for summing up his life and work will seem even more daunting.
But writing a Luther biography in 2017 is a special challenge, perhaps among the greatest any author can face, at least with regard to the competition from other authors. This is the 500th anniversary of Luther’s Reformation, so whether one likes it or not, we are all living through the “Year of Luther,” or Lutherjahr, as it has been called in his native land; publishers in Europe and North America are marking the occasion by flooding the world with Luther biographies. In the first 10 months of this year, over a dozen English-language biographies have appeared, including one in comic book form and one aimed at children. And all of these follow on the heels of at least another half-dozen magisterial biographies published in the past two decades, including Martin Brecht’s exhaustive three-volume masterpiece, “Martin Luther,” which Metaxas praises as “unsurpassable.” Needless to say, such excess could easily stun any reader, cause an outbreak of fatigue — Lutherjahrmüdigkeit as Germans might say — or scare away all would-be Luther biographers for years to come.
Most new Luther biographies are by historians who are Reformation specialists and, as one might expect, they have been aimed at an academic audience, even when written for trade publishers rather than university presses. Whatever fresh insights these biographies can claim rest more on interpretation than on the discovery of new facts.

Metaxas, the author of popular books like “Amazing Grace,” “Miracles” and “Bonhoeffer,” is an exception in Luther studies, at least partially. His “Martin Luther” is not a scholarly biography, despite its footnotes, but an attempt to make Luther attractive to a general audience. The Luther portrayed here is a hero cast in a Whiggish mold, a titanic figure who single-handedly slays the dragon of the Dark Ages, rescues God from an interpretive dungeon, invents individual freedom and ushers in modernity.
This approach — reflected in the book’s subtitle — closely resembles that taken by Thomas Cahill in “How the Irish Saved Civilization” and Arthur Herman in “How the Scots Invented the Modern World.” Both of those books reached wide audiences by simplifying the complexities of history and attributing epochal shifts to single causes. Such reductionism has its charms, and bears some resemblance to the truth. But much like any caricature, it should not be mistaken for an accurate portrayal of its subject.
Because of his constant interweaving of narrative and analysis, Metaxas’ “Martin Luther” is difficult to assess as a single text, especially because the analysis seems more of an intrusion into the narrative than an elucidation or expansion of it. Metaxas’ relentless hyping of the world-shaking significance of Luther and of each and every aspect of his Reformation is often closer to sermonizing than to the dispassionate tone one would expect from a historian. As a result, the book’s two components should be evaluated individually.

As far as the narrative is concerned, Metaxas has done his research, and there is much here that is praiseworthy. The details of Luther’s life and of his struggles against the status quo are related with verve, and with a genuine talent for rendering the intricacies of late medieval theology approachable to those who may have never encountered it before. Metaxas knows how to tell a story and how to develop characters, and this talent makes his narrative at once gripping and accessible.

Metaxas pays closest attention to a relatively short span of time, roughly 1513 to 1525, when Luther morphed from a troubled monk into an audacious rebel, and then into a cranky authority figure with reactionary tendencies. These were the years when Luther not only transformed himself but also caused the greatest stir. At the same time, Metaxas gives his readers an excellent glimpse of the whole of Luther’s life, from the cradle to the grave, and particularly of the dangers he constantly faced until his dying day, after he dared to challenge Pope Leo X and the holy Roman emperor Charles V.
Assessing Metaxas’ intrusive analysis, however, is not easy. Since this is a book aimed at a general audience, its hyperbole and hagiographic bent are understandable, at least to some extent. Complexity, ambiguity and paradox may be sweet nectar for historians, but not necessarily for a broad public that tends to prefer grand generalizations, sound bites and contemporary categories into which to shoehorn historical figures. Portraying Luther as “the man who created the future” or a modern hero who made the Middle Ages buckle “under their own weight” and give way to the future or claiming that “the people … strode onto the world’s stage for the first time” under Luther’s leadership may be a great way to make him appealing to a large segment of the public. But hyperbolic reductionism of this sort will be offensive to the vast majority of historians.
The Martin Luther encountered in this biography is a hero, first and foremost, and also something of a saint — despite the fact that Luther rejected traditional concepts of sainthood. The political and military support that made his Reformation possible is given short shrift, as are the equally revolutionary ideas and actions of such pivotal figures as his predecessors John Wycliffe and John Hus, or contemporaries like Ulrich Zwingli, Martin Bucer and Sebastian Franck. Metaxas’ Luther is fearless, and “concerned more about the people than about the correctness of the theology.” He is a champion of personal freedom and of the rights of the common folk, despite his violent reaction to the Peasants’ Revolt of 1524-25. He is selfless and unerring, and nearly flawless, despite his bad temper (fully on display on the Luther insult generator at ergofabulous.org/luther). Those who oppose him are always ill-willed, unreasonable, “oddly stubborn” or burdened by “painfully cloudy theology.” Moreover, according to Metaxas, the dissolution of Christendom into different competing churches could have been “eminently avoidable” if everyone had been good-hearted and smart enough to agree with Luther. Little is said about Luther’s noxious tirades against Jews, save to dismiss them as “one of the most bizarre episodes of Luther’s life,” consisting of a “few passages” in his “most injudicious writings.” And nothing at all is said about the great embarrassment Luther caused his church by secretly condoning the bigamy of his most powerful protector, Landgrave Philip of Hesse.
In brief, of the two distinct but inseparable strands that constitute this book, one is instructive and engaging, the other highly subjective and distracting. The contrast between the two is perplexing but, ultimately, it probably doesn’t matter. Though full of overblown claims, Metaxas’ “Martin Luther” may attract readers with its engaging narrative and, in the process, introduce them to a remarkable and complex man, one who boasted of being imperfect while insisting that he was always right.

NEW DELHI — On Saturday, Rahul Gandhi, the heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, is to formally take over as the president of the Indian National Congress. His family has run the Congress party for four generations. His father, Rajiv Gandhi; his grandmother Indira Gandhi; and his great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru governed India as prime ministers for a combined total of 38 years.
Mr. Gandhi, 47, is succeeding his mother, Sonia Gandhi, who has been at the helm of the party for the past 19 years. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty outrivals the Kennedys’ for longevity. Mr. Gandhi is taking over at a time of decline in the fortunes of the Congress party, which suffered a devastating defeat by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014 and controls a mere five out of 29 state governments.
With his party’s repeated failures to win elections in the face of the combination of charisma and aggressive Hindu nationalism that fuels Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s politics, Mr. Gandhi has settled on a carefully devised departure from the party’s past by openly and visibly embracing his Hindu identity.
The Congress party has had departures from its commitment to secularism and minority rights in the past — acts of violence against Muslims under its watch and culpability in the 1984 massacres of the Sikh minority — but never before has it abandoned its rhetorical and symbolic commitment to these ideas.
That abandonment became glaringly obvious during the recently concluded election for the Legislative Assembly in the western Indian state of Gujarat — the home state of Mr. Modi.
Before he became prime minister in 2014, Mr. Modi led his Bharatiya Janata Party to three consecutive and comfortable victories in Gujarat. His move to New Delhi left the B.J.P. in Gujarat with a weak leadership, and the election in Gujarat came as Mr. Modi was facing popular criticism over the state of India’s economy and, for the first time, seemed nervous.
Mr. Gandhi, who entered politics by winning a seat in the Indian Parliament in 2004, once came across as a reluctant politician and faltered when faced with aggressive challenges by journalists or political opponents. But he has reinvented himself as a more decisive politician in recent months, on occasion deploying acerbic wit to tear into Mr. Modi.
Mr. Gandhi led his party’s vigorous campaign in Gujarat. The results will be announced on Monday, but even if the Congress party doesn’t win the election, it is expected to gain seats and improve its standing.
The B.J.P. campaign, marked by Islamophobic speeches, was aimed at intensifying Hindu majoritarian impulses. Mr. Modi even accused several leaders of the Congress party, including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, of working with Pakistan to defeat his party in Gujarat.
To counter Mr. Modi’s portrayal of the Congress party as overly sympathetic to India’s Muslims, Mr. Gandhi visited over 25 temples and made it a point to speak at rallies with tilak, the vermilion paste placed on the forehead by the temple priest, prominently displayed. His temple stops were publicized as much as his election meetings and speeches in Gujarat.
The Constitution of India, adopted in 1950, envisaged a state that remained equidistant from all religions while protecting the rights of minorities. In practice this meant that most political leaders visited temples, mosques, gurudwaras and churches with equal ease.
Mr. Modi was the first prominent Indian politician to breach this equivalence. In 2001, he was appointed chief minister of Gujarat. In 2002, his administration largely stood aside as Hindu mobs attacked Muslims after the deaths of 58 Hindu pilgrims in a train fire allegedly set by Muslims. The riots cemented Mr. Modi’s position as the foremost Hindu nationalist politician, and the state’s Muslims increasingly sought safety in ghettos.
Since Mr. Modi became prime minister, Muslims, who are just under 10 percent of the population in Gujarat and under 15 percent in India, have faced increased marginalization and hostility across the country.
Muslim transporters of cattle are being attacked in the name of cow protection, and Muslim men have been accused of “love jihad,” the term Hindu nationalists have given to a perceived conspiracy by Muslim men to woo, marry and convert Hindu women to Islam.
School textbooks have been amended to include glowing references to regional leaders seen as embodying Hindu resistance to the Muslim domination of the Mughal emperors.
Rather than stand against majoritarian and Islamophobic politics, Mr. Gandhi chose to fight the electoral battle on the terms set by the Hindu right. Mr. Gandhi stayed silent about the violence and hostility encountered by India’s Muslim citizens. He essentially agreed with the terms set by Hindu nationalists that to speak of equal citizenship and political rights for India’s 165 million Muslims is no longer acceptable in India.
Mr. Gandhi regularly posts on Twitter his critiques of Mr. Modi’s economic policies, but he has referred to India’s Muslims just once in over 3,000 tweets spread over two years. There is a problem with this approach: Little separates economic policy under Mr. Modi from economic policy under the Congress party.
The joblessness and lack of economic opportunities that Mr. Gandhi refers to are products of a decade of his Congress party’s rule. He has criticized the Modi government new goods and sales tax, a nationwide tax replacing the business taxes varying from state to state and aimed at converting India into a single market. But it was largely conceived under a Congress government, and its institution is very much a result of structures set up at the time.
Mr. Gandhi’s pitch to voters amounts to the claim that he not only can carry out the same economic policies better than Mr. Modi but also is as good a Hindu as Mr. Modi.
A striking illustration of Mr. Gandhi’s strategy was his much publicized visit to the Somnath temple during the Gujarat campaign. It is an important site of Hinduism, originally a ninth-century temple dedicated to Shiva, which was reduced to ruins after being vandalized by medieval Muslim kings. It was rebuilt in 1950 despite the reservations of Mr. Gandhi’s great-grandfather Nehru, who saw it as Hindu revivalism.
Over time, the Somnath temple had become a monument to Hindu injury and rage. Its reconstruction helped inspire Mr. Modi’s mentors in the Hindu nationalist movement to demolish the medieval Babri mosque in Ayodhya and eventually replace it with a grand temple for Rama, whose birthplace they believe the mosque was built upon. The demolition of the Babri mosque in December 1992 transformed Indian politics and led to the rise of the B.J.P.
After Mr. Gandhi’s visit to Somnath, social media was abuzz with news that he had signed the temple register as a non-Hindu. The Congress party responded by stating that not only was Mr. Gandhi a Hindu but he also wore the sacred thread that only upper-caste Hindus can wear after an initiation ceremony conducted by a priest. It conveyed the casteist message that the laws of Hinduism don’t even allow Mr. Modi, who comes from a lower caste, to wear the sacred thread Mr. Gandhi wears.
Whether or not the Congress party gains electorally from this Hindu one-upmanship, it is clear that Mr. Modi, much like Margaret Thatcher claiming “New Labour” as her greatest political success, can boast of Mr. Gandhi’s not-so-secular Congress party as his lasting legacy.

KARACHI, Pakistan — I first heard of yoga while I was growing up in Pakistan in the 1980s, with the arrival on the Karachi scene of a colorful personality called Professor Moiz Hussain. He had trained at the Yoga Institute in Mumbai, then branched out into alternative stress-reduction and healing techniques like reiki from Japan, NLP (neurolinguistic programming) from California and qigong, with roots in China. His Institute of Mind Sciences and Classical Yoga attracted a certain type of Karachi woman — affluent and well traveled — who was interested in developing her mind and body. Slowly at first, one teacher after another emerged to offer classes. Still, they had to be careful: The 1980s was a time of rigorous Islamization in Pakistan and cold hostility to India, and anything remotely associated with India or Hinduism was discouraged if not outlawed.
This particularly affected the arts, namely classical Indian dance; government officials banned public performances as both “vulgar” and “Indian”; Pakistani students of the art could not obtain visas to study under gurus in India, and local teachers had to immigrate to other countries because classical dance became so unpopular they could not attract students. (Only Kathak, with its Mughal origins in northwestern India before partition, was looked upon with a less jaundiced eye than the unabashedly Hindu-flavored Odissi or Bharatanatyam schools of dance.)
The way around this was to introduce yoga as a practice less spiritual than physical, but yoga classes in Karachi remained small, private and for a select few. Then, in the 1990s, when state-run television gave way to a profusion of private television channels, yoga found another outlet: breakfast and morning shows in which a physical activity segment aimed at housewives often included a 20-minute or half-hour yoga session. Sandwiched in between advice on the best foods for a baby and how to cook enticing meals for the household, a nonthreatening form of yoga — no extreme physical poses, just one that could be performed in modest clothing — was available to women in Pakistan with access to cable channels.
Viewers were encouraged to stretch and breathe to cultivate healthy bodies and minds, a goal not incompatible with the moderately conservative form of Islam practiced by 90 percent of Pakistanis. Yoga even began to come out into the open, with sessions held in public parks, where some teachers made mild comparisons between yogic meditation and Islamic reflection, or the poses in a simple sun salutation and the positions taken in salat, a ritual Islamic prayer. This opened up yoga to middle-class, conservative Pakistanis who might have remained hostile to the practice had it been presented as a purely Hindu or Indian ascetic discipline.
Today, yoga is immensely popular in all cities of Pakistan; a yoga teacher named Shamshad Haider claims to run 50 yoga clubs in Punjab, and International Yoga Day has been celebrated in Pakistan for three years in a row. Yoga is practiced all the way from Chitral in the north to Karachi in the south. There’s a whole crop of younger teachers now equipped with training from India, Thailand and Bali, as well as from yoga schools in North America and Britain. Teachers at swank studios in Karachi attract students through Facebook pages and affiliations with the International Yoga Alliance.
Their classes incorporate styles from hatha, vinyasa flow, ashtanga, even power yoga and Bikram yoga. They use the Sanskrit names for the poses interchangeably with the English ones, and both women-only and mixed classes are popular. Meanwhile, yoga still appears on television, in schools and in park sessions, with women meditating while wearing shalwar kameezes, or full abayas and hijabs, and men with long beards and shalwar kameezes performing sun salutations next to men in track pants and T-shirts.
Yoga purists would probably bristle at the attempt to dissociate yoga from Hinduism or India, but it’s not that different from what’s happening to yoga in the West, with its hot yoga studios and aerial yoga and Yoga Asana championships. It also reminds me of what has been happening to Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. In the West, Sufism has been disconnected from its Muslim roots and presented as a universal movement of peace and tolerance, the 13th-century Persian mystic Rumi portrayed as a lovelorn poet singing of love rather than a conservative Islamic cleric bent on forging a fierce connection with his creator. A necessary sacrifice, perhaps, to spread the universal message of peace, tolerance and love.
Pakistan, which was amputated from India in 1947, then lured by the promise of power and richness coming from the Middle East, has never been able to decide whether its identity is Arab or South Asian. After decades of trying to identify with a purely Islamic heritage and history, some Pakistanis are finally recognizing that their heritage is unique, informed by strains of tradition and heritage from many geographical areas: Central Asia and Persia, as well as India and the Middle East.
Our current challenge is to reconnect with the many sources of our roots and heritage, while forging a new identity that will serve us well into the future. Pakistan recently unveiled a 1,700-year-old sleeping Buddha statue from an ancient Buddhist site in Bhamala, one of many that dot Pakistan’s north and northwest — a strong testament to its pre-Islamic heritage. Progressive historians — admittedly in the minority still — are trying to educate Pakistani students about their country’s ancient history and religions, after years of being told that Pakistan’s history begins only with the invasion of Sindh by the Arab conqueror Muhammed bin Qasim in A.D. 711.
As I practice yoga in the crisp air of a mild Karachi winter, gazing out to the Arabian Sea, I can’t help wondering whether some of this reconnection might come from yoga. We move in unison as our teacher calls out the Sanskrit names of the poses called asanas. Then the call to prayer begins to ring out from a nearby mosque and we fall silent, listening to the sound of our own breaths and the time-old Arabic words of the azaan. As soon as the practice is over, I’ll roll up my yoga mat and go find my prayer mat. I’ve never felt so integrated, so connected to my Islamic heritage and my South Asian roots.

Global and regional leaders warned of the dangers of declaring Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. President Trump announced the change on Wednesday.
ROME — Pope Francis said, “I cannot remain silent.” The United Nations secretary general spoke of his “great anxiety.” The European Union expressed “serious concern.” American allies like Britain, France, Germany and Italy all declared it a mistake.
A chorus of international leaders criticized the Trump administration’s decision on Wednesday to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, calling it a dangerous disruption that contravenes United Nations resolutions and could inflame one of the world’s thorniest conflicts.
Secretary General António Guterres and Pope Francis both expressed alarm that the announcement would provoke new tensions in the Holy City, which is revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims.
Within minutes of Mr. Trump’s speech, in which he said the American Embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Mr. Guterres delivered what amounted to a diplomatic rebuke.

Reading a statement outside the Security Council chambers at United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr. Guterres criticized “any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” underscoring the administration’s departure from decades of American policy.

“Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli sides,” Mr. Guterres said.
“In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear: There is no alternative to the two-state solution,” he said. “There is no Plan B.”
In Rome, Pope Francis prayed that Jerusalem’s status be preserved and needless conflict avoided.
“I cannot remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has developed in recent days,” Francis said at his weekly general audience at the Vatican. “And at the same time, I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.”
“Jerusalem is a unique city,” he said, “sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, where the Holy Places for the respective religions are venerated, and it has a special vocation to peace.”
In especially strong language, the pope added, “I pray to the Lord that such identity be preserved and strengthened for the benefit of the Holy Land, the Middle East and the entire world, and that wisdom and prudence prevail, to avoid adding new elements of tension in a world already shaken and scarred by many cruel conflicts.”
The European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, expressed concern about “the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace.”
In a statement, she reiterated the bloc’s position that Jerusalem should be a future capital of two states, Israeli and Palestinian, and that embassies should not be moved there until the city’s final status was resolved. She cited a 1980 United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israel’s attempted annexation of East Jerusalem as a violation of international law.

She called on actors in the region “to show calm and restraint in order to prevent any escalation.”
Within a few hours of Mr. Trump’s speech, eight countries on the 15-member Security Council — including some of America’s closest allies — requested an emergency meeting to be held before the end of the week. Diplomats said it would most likely be scheduled for Friday.
Joakim Vaverka, political coordinator of Sweden’s United Nations mission, said in a statement that the delegations of Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay had sought the meeting, including a briefing by Mr. Guterres, “in light of the statement today by the president of the United States regarding the status of Jerusalem.”
The warnings by the pope, the United Nations and the European Union spoke to a broad fear that Mr. Trump’s announcement would be the death knell for an already moribund peace process and that it would pull the plug on a two-state solution.
Critics of the announcement said the change in policy removed any pretense that the United States is a neutral broker for peace. Palestinians and other Arabs in the region already view the Trump administration as leaning toward Israel’s right-wing government. The change in American policy “destroys the peace process,” said the Palestinian prime minister, Rami Hamdallah.

Some of the United States’ closest allies expressed apprehension.
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain called Mr. Trump’s decision “unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.”
President Emmanuel Macron of France, who was in Algeria on Wednesday meeting with the country’s president and other figures, said in a news conference that the decision by Mr. Trump was “regrettable” and that “France and Europe are committed to a two-state solution.” He called on all parties to refrain from violence.
Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said through a spokesman that her government “does not support this position, because the status of Jerusalem is to be resolved in the framework of a two-state solution.”
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy wrote on Twitter: “Jerusalem holy city, unique on earth. Its future will be defined within the framework of the peace process based on the two states, Israel and Palestine.”
President Trump declared recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Here’s why that’s so fraught.
In China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Geng Shuang, expressed support for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and urged all parties to the conflict to proceed cautiously. “What we worry about is any potential flare-up of regional tensions,” he said. “The status of Jerusalem is a complicated and sensitive issue.”
Advertisement
Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, told reporters in Brussels, “Clearly this is a decision that makes it more important than ever that the long-awaited American proposals on the Middle East peace process are now brought forward.”
That process, led by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has seemingly failed to get off the ground.
Leaders in the region had already warned against the move. A statement from the royal palace of King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose kingdom is the custodian of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, emphasized that the city was critical to “achieving peace and stability in the region and the world.”
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was convening a summit meeting of the main Pan-Islamic body next week in Istanbul to discuss the American move and to show, as his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters in Ankara, “joint action among Islamic countries.”
Mr. Kalin called the expected change a “grave mistake,” adding that “Jerusalem is our honor, Jerusalem is our common cause, Jerusalem is our red line.”
Iran, unsurprisingly, condemned the change. Its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said at a conference in Tehran on Wednesday that it reflected the “incompetence and failure” of the American government.
Like much of Europe, the Vatican has long been sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians. The Vatican established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1994, and Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Israel and the Palestinian territories.

In 2012, the Vatican called for “an internationally guaranteed special statute” for Jerusalem, with the goal of “safeguarding the freedom of religion and of conscience, the identity and sacred character of Jerusalem as a Holy City, (and) respect for, and freedom of, access to its holy places.”
Francis visited the Holy Land in 2014, but he upset some Israelis by flying by helicopter directly from Jordan to the “State of Palestine,” as the Vatican schedule at the time referred to the territories. He visited Israel afterward.
In 2015, the Vatican entered into a treaty with the “State of Palestine.”
On Tuesday, Francis spoke by telephone to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, about the unfolding crisis. Before the pope’s public remarks to the faithful at the Vatican on Wednesday, he met privately with a group of Palestinians participating in interfaith dialogue with officials at the Vatican.
“The Holy Land is for us Christians the land par excellence of dialogue between God and mankind,” he said. “The primary condition of that dialogue is reciprocal respect and a commitment to strengthening that respect, for the sake of recognizing the rights of all people, wherever they happen to be.”

DHAKA, Bangladesh — On the eve of his return to Rome, Pope Francis on Friday used the word “Rohingya,” coming face-to-face with some of the persecuted Muslims whose plight had cast a long shadow over his visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Critics had been asking why a pontiff who so often condemned injustice against the downtrodden had stayed silent earlier in the week, when he made his first visit to Myanmar, a country in which Rohingya Muslims have been raped, killed or driven into exile in Bangladesh by a brutal military campaign of repression.
In Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, on Friday, the pope listened to the stories, and held the hands, one by one, of 16 survivors of the persecution — 12 men, two women and two young girls — vowing: “We won’t close our hearts or look away. The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.”
On a stage following a large interfaith gathering for peace, the pope patted men’s shoulders and pressed the forehead of a girl whose parents and brothers had been killed. He bent low to kiss a small child on the head. The enormity of their tragedy seemed to weigh on him.

“In the name of everyone, of those who have persecuted you, of those who have done you harm, above all for the indifference of the world, I ask forgiveness. Forgiveness,” the pope said in emotional and apparently unscripted remarks, as the survivors stood around him. He did not address his own recent silence.
To the large audience of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and others, he stressed that the Rohingya, as all of humanity, were created in the image of God and he vowed to continue helping them “so that their rights become recognized.”

The Rohingya are stateless Muslims from western Myanmar who, according to the United Nations, the United States and many human rights groups, have been the targets of ethnic cleansing. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled across the border to Bangladesh, where they live in desperate, sprawling refugee camps in areas like Cox’s Bazar, where the group that met the pope had earlier sought shelter.
Francis had in the past, from the Vatican, denounced the “persecution of our Rohingya brothers,” but during his visit Monday to Thursday in Myanmar, diplomatic considerations and a fear of prompting a military crackdown on the Christian minority had kept the usually outspoken pope from uttering the term Rohingya or directly addressing the humanitarian disaster.
That uncharacteristic silence prompted criticism and frustration from those who had grown accustomed to considering the pope as a moral compass in a world that had gone adrift. The Vatican found itself refuting the notion that the pope had relinquished the moral authority that imbued his office with influence.
But as soon as the pope left Myanmar, where the Vatican hinted that he had raised the issue with the military commander, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, and the country’s de facto leader, the tarnished Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, he was more willing to broach the issue.
On Thursday night, at an event with Bangladesh’s president, he crept up to the word Rohingya, talking about Rakhine State where massacres, systematic rape and burning of villages have occurred.
But through much of Friday, he focused on his own small church in Bangladesh, with Roman Catholics numbering less than 400,000 in a densely populated, majority Muslim country of 160 million. In the morning, he celebrated Mass during which he ordained new priests and then met with church leaders, complimenting them on their attention to the poor.

“Especially in light of the present refugee crisis, we see how much more needs to be done,” he said.
Remarkably, for a pope who has consistently elevated and championed the human suffering of refugees, some supporters of Francis also thought that he could have done more during his trip.

Others understood the diplomatic minefield he had perhaps foolishly wandered into. They contented themselves with his mere presence, hoping that would be enough to draw attention to the issue.
“He had to be balanced over in Myanmar,” said Rafiqul Islam, a Muslim auto dealer in the audience who has participated in charity missions to bring blankets and clothing to the Rohingya in Cox’s Bazar. “But here he can call all the world to please, help this problem. They are butchering us.”
Before the interfaith event began, the Rohingya took their seats on green plastic chairs to the side of a stage and at the foot of a riser where the news media assembled. Reporters clamored, cameras clicked and video was taken as a little girl ate a clementine on her mother’s lap. An older girl — who said she had lost her parents, two brothers, and two uncles in the violence — sat next to them.
Abdul Fyez, 35, stared ahead with sunken eyes. “We have been Rohingya for generations, my father and my grandfather,” he said, adding that the Myanmar military had killed his brother.
Mohammed Ayub, 32, said the Myanmar military killed his three-year-old son when they attacked his village in August. “The pope should say Rohingya. He is the leader of the world,” Mr. Ayub said.
Moments later, the pope was brought by rickshaw into the tented garden of the archbishop’s residence and saluted the large crowd seated in rows on the lawn. Many of them wore the traditional dress of their Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist or Christian faiths.
“May our meeting this afternoon be a clear sign of the efforts of the leaders and followers of the religions present in this country to live together in mutual respect and good will,” the pope said, adding that he hoped that the spirit of unity would serve as “a subtle yet firm rebuke to those who would seek to foment division, hatred and violence in the name of religion.”
Throughout the trip, Francis had been making subtle asides, alluding to principles of democracy, equity and tolerance. For Francis, it seemed, the Rohingya were the endangered whose name he dared not speak. But on Friday night, toward the close of his trip, that all changed when he brought them onto center stage.

“Many of you have told me of the big heart of Bangladesh that welcomed you,” the pope said as they stood around him. “And now I appeal to your big hearts to be capable of granting us the forgiveness that we ask.”

Over the past 15 years, my country, Turkey, has gone through a colossal political revolution. The traditional secular elite that identifies with the nation’s modernist founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, has been replaced by religious conservatives who, until recently, were largely powerless and marginalized. The religious conservatives have by now come to dominate virtually all institutions of the state, as well as the media and even much of the business sector. In short, they have become the new ruling elite.
This political revolution has had an inadvertent outcome. It has tested the ostensible virtues of these religious conservatives — and they have failed. They have failed this test so terribly that it raises the question of whether religiosity and morality really go hand in hand, as so many religious people like to claim.
The religious conservatives have morally failed because they ended up doing everything that they once condemned as unjust and cruel. For decades, they criticized the secular elite for nepotism and corruption, for weaponizing the judiciary and for using the news media to demonize and intimidate their opponents. Yet after their initial years in power, they began repeating all of the same behavior they used to condemn, often even more blatantly than their predecessors.
This is a familiar story: The religious conservatives have become corrupted by power. But power corrupts more easily when you have neither principles nor integrity.
Notably, some of the more conscientious voices among Turkey’s religious conservatives criticize this ugly reality. Mustafa Ozturk, a popular theologian and a newspaper columnist, recently declared that religious conservatives are failing the moral test miserably. He wrote: “For the next 40 to 50 years, we Muslims will have no right to say anything to any human being about faith, morals, rights and law. The response, ‘We have seen you as well,’ will be a slap in our face.”
Another prominent theologian, the former mufti of Istanbul, Mustafa Cagrici, also wrote about “the growing gap between religiosity and morality.” In the past, he noted, moral conservatives like him would argue that “there could be no morality without religion.” But now, he wrote, “there should be no religion without morality.”
Such discussions may look specific to contemporary Turkey, but they raise a question that is globally, timelessly relevant: Does religion really make people more moral human beings? Or does the gap between morality and the moralists — a gap evident in Turkey today and in many other societies around the world — reveal an ugly hypocrisy behind all religion?
My humble answer is: It depends. Religion can work in two fundamentally different ways: It can be a source of self-education, or it can be a source of self-glorification. Self-education can make people more moral, while self-glorification can make them considerably less moral.
Religion can be a source of self-education, because religious texts often have moral teachings with which people can question and instruct themselves. The Quran, just like the Bible, has such pearls of wisdom. It tells believers to “uphold justice” “even against yourselves or your parents and relatives.” It praises “those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind.” It counsels: “Repel evil with what is better so your enemy will become a bosom friend.” A person who follows such virtuous teachings will likely develop a moral character, just as a person who follows similar teachings in the Bible will.
But trying to nurture moral virtues is one thing; assuming that you are already moral and virtuous simply because you identify with a particular religion is another. The latter turns religion into a tool for self-glorification. A religion’s adherents assume themselves to be moral by default, and so they never bother to question themselves. At the same time, they look down on other people as misguided souls, if not wicked infidels.
For such people, religion works not as cure for the soul, but as drug for the ego. It makes them not humble, but arrogant.
In legalistic religious traditions, like Judaism and Islam, this problem occurs when religion is reduced to the practice of rituals. Abiding by a legal code makes the believer feel upright in the eyes of God, even if she or he is immoral when dealing with fellow human beings.
An exceptional Jewish rabbi who lived two millenniums ago, Jesus of Nazareth, spotted this problem. Those practicing Pharisees who are “confident of their own righteousness and look down on everybody else,” he declared, are not really righteous. Sinners who regret their failures, he said, are more moral than the pious who boast.
Stripping morality from religion can also occur when a belief system is reduced to a simple group identity. This kind of “us vs. them” mentality can corrupt and radicalize any religious community — Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists alike can become hateful militants when they see themselves as righteous victims. That trend is visible everywhere from the Buddhist monks cheering ethnic cleansing in Myanmar to the Hindu majoritarians who dominate Indian politics to the violent Muslim extremists in the Middle East.
Conscientious believers in every tradition need to stand against the toxic urges that turn religion into a hollow vessel of arrogance, bigotry, hatred and greed. Otherwise, more and more evil will be done in their faith’s name. And more and more people will ask, as many young Turks are asking these days, what religion is really good for.

About 20 years ago, the eminent sociologist of religion Christian Smith coined a useful and resonant phrase, describing evangelical Christianity in the post-1960s United States as both “embattled and thriving.”
By this Smith meant that evangelicals had maintained an identity in a secularizing country that was neither separatist nor assimilated, but somehow mainstream and countercultural at once. Evangelicals were both fully part of American modernity (often educated suburbanites, rather than the backwoods yokels of caricature) and also living lives in tension with pluralistic and permissive values. And this combination, far from undercutting their communities, was actually a source of religious vitality and demographic strength.
Smith’s description still holds up pretty well. The story of American religion lately has been one of institutional decline, of Mainline Protestantism’s aging and Catholicism’s weakening and the rise of the so-called “nones.”
But there has been an evangelical exception. The evangelical market share has held steady while other traditions have declined, evangelical churches have continued to win more converts than they lose, and evangelical resilience is the main reason why religious conservatism retains an intense and active core.
The question is whether this resilience will survive the age of Trump. Some evangelical voices think not: Whether the subject is the debauched pagan in the White House, the mall-haunted candidacy of Roy Moore or the larger question of how to engage with secular culture, there is talk of an intergenerational crisis within evangelical churches, a widening disillusionment with a Trump-endorsing old guard, a feeling that a crackup must loom ahead.
In a recent cri de coeur on the influential Gospel Coalition site, Jared Wilson described younger evangelicals as “basically a bunch of theological orphans,” betrayed by older pastors who insisted on the importance of moral character and then abandoned these preachments for the sake of partisanship — revealing their own commitments as essentially idolatrous, and leaving the next generation no choice but to invent evangelicalism anew.
In a somewhat different vein, the Baylor professor Alan Jacobs responded to a question (from me) about where younger evangelical intellectual life is going by saying that “as far as I can tell, where young evangelicals are headed is simply out of evangelicalism.” Meaning that they will either go along with the drift of their elders and become church-of-American-greatness heretics, or else they will return to “older liturgical traditions,” Catholic and Orthodox and Anglican, and cease to identify with evangelicalism entirely.
I don’t know exactly what to make of these predictions. American evangelicalism has always contained a number of different tendencies: It’s home to rigorous heirs of the Reformation, seeker-sensitive megachurches, would-be ecumenical “mere Christians,” prosperity preachers and hard-edged Christian nationalists.
During the 2016 Republican primary, it was easy enough to argue that Trump was exploiting these divisions, winning Fox News-watching cultural evangelicals and prosperity-gospel types while losing churchgoers who cared about character and orthodoxy.
Then in the general election it was possible to argue that the latter groups only came around to Trump reluctantly, out of fear of contemporary liberalism’s anticlerical streak, and that their relationship to his identitarian nationalism was transactional and didn’t reflect any deep congruence.
If this is right, then the alienation of younger evangelical writers from Trumpism’s court pastors could indeed be a signifier of a coming evangelical crackup. In this scenario the label itself would become contested, with the kind of winsome and multiethnic evangelicalism envisioned by the anti-Trump Southern Baptist Russell Moore pitted against the nationalist evangelicalism of a Jerry Falwell Jr. or Robert Jeffress, and churches along the fault line internally embattled and dividing.
But it’s also possible that evangelical intellectuals and writers, and their friends in other Christian traditions, have overestimated how much a serious theology has ever mattered to evangelicalism’s sociological success. It could be that the Trump-era crisis of the evangelical mind is a parochial phenomenon, confined to theologians and academics and pundits and a few outlier congregations — and that it is this group, not the cultural Christians who voted enthusiastically for Trump, who represent the real evangelical penumbra, which could float away and leave evangelicalism less intellectual, more partisan, more racially segregated ... but as a cultural phenomenon, not all that greatly changed.
If so, then this would imply that white Christian tribalism and a very American sort of heresy, not a commitment to scripture and tradition, has kept evangelical churches thriving all these years. And if the God-and-country, pray-and-grow-rich tendencies sweep aside orthodox resistance, the evangelicalism that emerges might be more coherent and sociologically resilient, in the short run, for being rid of hand-wringers who don’t think Baptist choirs should set “Make America Great Again” to music.
This is a sobering idea, and one I hope is wrong.
But it is a paradox of this strange time that serious evangelicals should probably be rooting for a real post-Trump crisis in their churches — because its absence will tell them something depressing about where their movement’s strength lay all along.

Kaitlyn Schiess has a sterling evangelical pedigree. She grew up in evangelical churches in Colorado and Virginia and graduated from Liberty University before entering Dallas Theological Seminary last year to prepare for a career in the church. But lately she has been frustrated by evangelicals’ failure to challenge the prejudice and predation in their midst. Over the course of the week, as Roy Moore, the Republican senatorial candidate in Alabama, faced more allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with young women and teenagers, many evangelicals leapt to his defense.
To Ms. Schiess, this is one more sign that a new ritual has superseded Sunday worship and weeknight Bible studies: a profane devotional practice, with immense power to shape evangelicals’ beliefs. This “liturgy” is the nightly consumption of conservative cable news. Liberals love to complain about conservatives’ steady diet of misinformation through partisan media, but Ms. Schiess’s complaint is more profound: Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson aren’t just purveyors of distorted news, but high priests of a false religion.
“The reason Fox News is so formative is that it’s this repetitive, almost ritualistic thing that people do every night,” Ms. Schiess told me. “It forms in them particular fears and desires, an idea of America. This is convincing on a less than logical level, and the church is not communicating to them in that same way.”
It’s no secret that humans — religious and secular alike — often act on “less than logical” impulses. Social scientists have documented our tendency to reject reliable evidence if it challenges our beliefs. Hours of tearful victims’ testimony will not deter evangelicals who see Roy Moore as the latest Christian martyr persecuted by the liberal establishment. “Their loyalties are much more strongly formed by conservative media than their churches,” Ms. Schiess said. “That’s the challenge for church leaders today, I think — rediscovering rather ancient ideas about how to form our ultimate loyalty to God and his kingdom.”
When I sought out conservative and progressive critics of white evangelical politics and asked them how to best understand it, this was their answer: pay attention to worship, both inside and outside of church, because the church is not doing its job. Humans thrive on ritual and collective acts of devotion. And the way we worship has political consequences. It shapes our response to evil and our reaction to people different from ourselves.
Some evangelicals have grown so frustrated with their tradition’s captivity to a particular brand of politics — and the idolatries of white supremacy and the free market — that they have proposed a radical withdrawal from both Moral Majority-style activism and modern consumer culture. Worship, after all, is not just something that happens in church.
The philosopher James K. A. Smith, who teaches at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., has argued that our lives are shot through with unconscious acts of worship, whether we genuflect at the Apple Store or wake up whispering prayers for our child’s admission to the Ivy League. “We are, ultimately, liturgical animals because we are fundamentally desiring creatures,” he writes in his book “Desiring the Kingdom.” “We are what we love.”
In that case, rooting out idolatries means radical lifestyle change. Some disillusioned conservatives have embraced what the Christian writer Rod Dreher calls the “Benedict Option”: a retreat from the world to preserve the values of Christian civilization during these new Dark Ages, in the spirit of St. Benedict.
He argues that Christians should stop trying to “make America great again,” abandon the ends-justify-the-means politics that leads them to defend predators and scoundrels like Mr. Moore, and focus instead on nurturing local Christian community. “Hostile secular nihilism has won the day in our nation’s government, and the culture has turned powerfully against traditional Christians,” Mr. Dreher writes in “The Benedict Option.”
This kind of intense localism may lead one to befriend unfamiliar neighbors, and hospitality is a major theme of Mr. Dreher’s book. But at a time when many Americans live in economically and ethnically segregated communities, it seems doubtful that further withdrawal from the world will stimulate radical empathy. The urge to batten down the hatches may actually feed the cultural patterns that enabled the election of Donald Trump: the impulse to associate only with people like ourselves and grow even more certain that evil forces are persecuting us.
Luma Simms likes to say that she tried the Benedict Option before it was trendy. She emigrated to California from Iraq as a young girl. Her father was Syrian Orthodox, her mother a Chaldean Catholic, but the desire to assimilate drove her to convert to evangelical Protestantism. “When I asked myself, what does it mean to become American, part of the answer was espousing an evangelical Protestant worldview,” she told me. “I wanted to be on the political side that believed America was good.”
After Ms. Simms became a parent, she began to worry about the influence of secular culture on her children as well as the politicization of mainstream evangelicalism. In 2006 her family moved to Arizona to join an insular church that promoted home schooling and strict patriarchal authority. “We were protecting our children, raising them up to be stronger citizens of a rightly understood America, so that when American culture starts collapsing like Dreher keeps telling us it will, they would rise up, having been well disciplined and educated, to become leaders,” she said.
The community was so cloistered and dogmatic that it estranged her from her oldest daughter and pushed her to cut off contact with her own parents. The church “made families like us view almost everyone outside that circle as a potential enemy of our thoughts,” Ms. Simms told me. After a dispute over the pastor’s authority, the church disintegrated in 2010.
Even mainstream churches can inadvertently encourage this kind of cultural quarantine: Most Americans still bow their heads in congregations dominated by a single racial or ethnic group. Although the diversity of congregations is growing nationwide, eight in 10 Americans still attend a house of worship in which one ethnic group makes up at least 80 percent of the congregation, according to the most recent National Congregations Study.
Reformers have long been working to build multiracial bridges in Christian academia and media, but these efforts alone won’t desegregate religious fellowship. Ekemini Uwan is a Nigerian-American who has ventured farther than most black Christians into the citadels of white evangelicalism. Last year she graduated from Westminster Theological Seminary in Glenside, Pa. For most of her time there, she was the only black woman in her program, she told me (the school has a sizable Asian student population, but fewer than 6 percent of students identify as black or Latino). She writes for traditionally white evangelical media, like Christianity Today magazine. But she has continued to attend “a predominantly black church” in Philadelphia, she said.
Ms. Uwan is used to keeping her guard up in scholarship and journalism, but worship is different: It requires the freedom to be vulnerable. “There’s what we theologians call an eschatological intrusion. It’s a foretaste of what we’re going to experience with God around the throne in the new heavens and new earth. It gets us out of our own world for an hour or two. You’re lost in worship, in wonder.” In a largely white worship setting, “when you have to prove yourself all the time, when your orthodoxy is always in question due to your blackness, you’re not safe to be vulnerable and honest,” she said.
When the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. observed that 11 o’clock on a Sunday morning is the most segregated hour in America, he was acknowledging the special power that ritual and community have to stoke or weaken both love and hatred. There is no substitute for sharing the bread and wine — the climax of the Christian liturgy — with people unlike yourself, Ms. Schiess said. She called for fighting false idols with right worship: “Fox News forms a fear, a caricature of other people; if communion were done in churches with diverse populations, it would counteract that fear.”
A new theology of communion appealed to Ms. Simms, the Christian in Arizona. A few years ago she converted to Catholicism, moved by its balance of otherworldliness and earthly compassion: “The sacraments elevate us,” she said. For Catholics, the bread and wine are not metaphors for Jesus’ body and blood, but the real thing — a miraculous, fleshly conduit between God and creation. The Vatican has stressed the doctrine of the “mystical body of Christ” — which includes, at least potentially, all human beings — in response to racism, genocide and other atrocities of the 20th century.
Catholic theology is not inherently more moral than Protestantism, and the sacraments have not saved the Catholic Church from its share of hypocrisy and crime over the centuries. But for some evangelicals, a stronger sense of participation in holy mystery offers a metaphysical jolt to the system — at a time when the relationship between evangelical worship and politics seems broken.
Richard Rohr, a Franciscan friar and prolific author who runs the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, was surprised when his publisher told him that his books on Christian contemplation and the power of liturgy are most popular with young evangelical men — who see a direct connection between changing worship and changing politics. “So many of the millennial evangelicals I work with, they’re so disillusioned with their good parents’ inability to deal with racism, sexism and homophobia — the issues tearing our country apart,” he told me.
Other young Christians are pursuing new forms of worship outside of traditional churches altogether. If you’re wondering what the future of not-so-organized religion looks like, look to the community that has grown up around “The Liturgists,” a podcast hosted by Michael Gungor, a musician, and Mike McHargue, a science writer (both are former evangelicals).
When they began the podcast in 2014, “we started it out of a sense of existential loneliness,” Mr. Gungor told me. They broadcast liturgical music, meditations and interviews with theologians and activists. The podcast has nurtured a community with a life of its own. Listeners find one another through social media, and the co-hosts travel the country to convene events where fans eat, drink and worship together — groups that often continue meeting after Mr. Gungor and Mr. McHargue leave town.
“As America deinstitutionalizes and moves away from religion, people — especially millennials — have lost something. Their community becomes primarily virtual, they’re seeing people through a screen and not flesh and blood, and there’s great data that this leads them to loneliness and depression,” Mr. McHargue said. “The core of every podcast is, ‘you’re not alone,’ and that draws people in, but we can’t stay there. We have to draw them into some kind of communal practice.”
One to two million listeners download the podcast each month, and it is surely one of the most theologically diverse subcultures on the internet. The audience includes atheists, evangelicals, mainline liberal Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox Christians, all seeking new spiritual community.
All these people have one thing in common: the instinct that worship should be an act of humility, not hubris. It should be a discomfiting experience, not a doubling down on what’s easy and familiar. The battle for the soul of evangelicalism, the struggle to disentangle it from white supremacy, from misogyny — and from the instinct to defend politicians like Roy Moore — demands sound arguments grounded in evidence. But the effort must also advance at the precognitive level, in the habits and relationships of worshiping communities. Fellowship has the power to refashion angry gut feelings and instead form meek hearts and bounden duty.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — The Maronite Christian patriarch of Lebanon met with King Salman of Saudi Arabia in the Saudi capital on Tuesday during a rare visit by a Christian leader to the Islamic kingdom that ended up being as much about politics as religion.
The patriarch, Bechara Boutros al-Rai, arrived in Riyadh amid escalating tensions between the two nations over the surprise resignation of Lebanon’s prime minister, Saad Hariri, and Saudi threats against Hezbollah and Iran.
While few details were released on what the patriarch discussed with the king, the visit pleased many Lebanese and seemed to calm the situation.
The recent episode started when Mr. Hariri fled to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and announced his resignation from Lebanon’s government on Nov. 4, shocking even his closest aides and raising suspicions that the Saudis had forced him to quit.

Accusing Iran of meddling in Arab countries, he said its “hands” in the region “will be cut off,” apparently intended as a threat against Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that also has ministers in Lebanon’s government. A few days later, Saudi Arabia told its citizens to leave Lebanon, raising fears of war.

The rumors about Mr. Hariri’s status persisted, and a television interview this week meant to show that he was a free man failed to quiet them. Patriarch Rai told reporters before traveling to the kingdom on Monday that the situation had left many Lebanese “not at ease” and that he would raise issue with the king.
On Tuesday, dressed in red and black clerical robes and with a large gold cross around his neck, he met with King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Mr. Hariri, according to Saudi state news media.
After the visit, Mr. Hariri posted a message on Twitter for the first time in more than a week, saying he would return to Lebanon in the coming days.
For Saudi Arabia, a monarchy long defined by an ultraconservative interpretation of Islam often hostile to other religions, the decision to receive the patriarch seemed intended to show a new openness.
Since his father became king in 2015, Crown Prince Mohammed has sought to moderate the kingdom’s religious rhetoric. He has stripped the power to arrest from the religious police, arrested dozens of hard-line clerics and pushed for social changes, including promising women the right to drive starting in June.

Earlier this month, he told an international investment conference in Riyadh that the kingdom needed a “moderate, balanced Islam that is open to the world and to all religions and all traditions and peoples.”
For Lebanon, the visit cast Patriarch Rai in the role of unofficial ambassador, seeking clarity about the status of the prime minister and seeking to calm tensions that could endanger Lebanon and the hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living and working in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries.
The remittances they send home are essential to Lebanon’s economy.
Thousands of Maronite families live in Saudi Arabia, which has no churches and bans the public observance of any religion other than Islam.

“There is no life here as a Christian, or as a Catholic; life here is either as a neutral person or as a Muslim,” said Danny Nasrallah, a Lebanese Catholic who has worked in the kingdom in the field of business development for eight years. “You have to pray in your heart when you want to pray.”
While he and others did not expect any immediate changes after the patriarch’s visit, they saw it as a good omen of where the kingdom is headed.
“What’s important is that the line between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia remains open,” said Johnny Tannoury, a mechanical engineer who is Maronite. “There is a unique relationship between the Lebanese people and Saudi Arabia and we don’t want that to change.”
The Maronite church is found in Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus and follows the Eastern Rite of the Roman Catholic Church.
Patriarch Rai is the second Christian patriarch to visit the kingdom; the last such visit was in 1975, Reuters reported.
Nada Homsi contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.

The Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is stepping into the religious fray.
The title of the department’s blockbuster 2018 fashion exhibition will be “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.” Stretching across three galleries — the Anna Wintour Costume Center, the medieval rooms in the Met on Fifth Avenue and the Cloisters — and approximately 58,600 square feet, it will feature 50 or so ecclesiastical garments and accessories on loan from the Vatican, multiple works from the Met’s own collection of religious art and 150 designer garments that have been inspired by Catholic iconography or style.
These range from the obvious (Versace and Dolce & Gabbana icons) to the more unexpected (a Chanel wedding gown inspired by a communion dress, Valentino couture gowns inspired by Francisco di Zurbarán’s paintings of monk’s robes). It will be the department’s largest show to date. It may also be the most provocative. And not just because of all the eye-rolling wordplay the title invites.
“Every show we do at the Costume Institute has that potential,” said Andrew Bolton, the curator in charge. “This one perhaps more than any other. But the focus is on a shared hypothesis about what we call the Catholic imagination and the way it has engaged artists and designers and shaped their approach to creativity, as opposed to any kind of theology or sociology. Beauty has often been a bridge between believers and unbelievers.”
So a Balenciaga one-seam wedding dress will be displayed in a chapel in the Cloisters dominated by an enormous crucifix; a Dolce & Gabbana mosaic piece from fall 2013, inspired by mosaics in the Cathedral of Monreale in Sicily, will be set against the Byzantine mosaics of the Met’s collection. The point is to connect the dots between material expression and sourcing.

Yet juxtaposing the sacred and the profane at this particular moment in time, when the Catholic church is rived with internal disputes between conservatives and liberals, and religion around the world is being weaponized and politicized, is a risky move. Especially in a city that is home to a significant Catholic population. Especially at a museum that recently underwent its own kind of crisis of faith, after the former director Thomas P. Campbell resigned under pressure in February for not being able to control a ballooning budget deficit, and his president, Daniel H. Weiss, was promoted to president and chief executive — the next director answerable to him. No matter how nuanced the actual curation, it could easily devolve into a popular cause célèbre.

You have to wonder: What will those who hew to a more conservative, absolutist line think?
Or, for that matter, other supporters of the pope, who has overtly rejected the sumptuous trappings and, indeed, fetishization of clothing within the church in favor of a simpler, humbler lifestyle? In many ways the Met itself, the imposing Beaux-Arts palace with its sweeping stair, as well as very high-end fashion — not to mention the Met Gala, the opening night party for the Costume Institute’s exhibition, which is famous both for being impossible to get into and for the amount of money it raises — stands for everything he has turned away from.
“We have confidence that the exhibition will inspire understanding, creativity and, along the way, constructive dialogue, which is precisely a museum’s role in our civil society,” Mr. Weiss said.
“We know it could be controversial for right wing or conservative Catholics and for liberal Catholics,” said Mr. Bolton, who noted he had consulted with representatives from different Catholic groups, including Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, to identify garments that could be incendiary. “There will always be viewers who want to reduce it to a political polemic.” But Mr. Bolton said he had not removed a single garment from the exhibition because it had been flagged as a potential lightning rod.
Still, the show may be the biggest gamble of Mr. Bolton’s career, and an early test for Mr. Weiss. And it is increasingly characteristic of Mr. Bolton’s tenure at the Costume Institute, where he seems to be pushing the department into the popular conversation. (By contrast his predecessor, Harold Koda, tended to more traditional shows like “Charles James: Beyond Fashion.”)
“It’s important to have ideas that are a reflection of contemporary interests,” Mr. Bolton said. “That strike a chord or are synergistic with the collective consciousness.”
Mr. Bolton had been thinking about doing a show on the connections between fashion and religion for years — since “the culture wars of the 1980s,” he said — but only became serious about it at the Met around two years ago. At that point, he had conceived it as an examination of the five world religions represented in the museum’s collections (Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam).
But after the designer Rei Kawakubo announced that she was ready for her retrospective last year, he postponed the project, and later decided to more narrowly define his topic, in part because he found that the majority of Western designers (and there are only three non-European or American-based names in the exhibition) were engaged in a dialogue with Catholicism. Perhaps because, as Mr. Bolton noted, so many Western designers were raised Catholic, including Elsa Schiaparelli, John Galliano, Riccardo Tisci, Christian Lacroix, Coco Chanel, Jeanne Lanvin, Norman Norell, Thom Browne and Roberto Capucci, among others. (Mr. Bolton is also Catholic.)

He began conversations with the Vatican in 2015; the loan came from the Sistine Chapel sacristy Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff, as opposed to the Vatican Museums, since it involves garments still in active use. (They date from the mid-18th-century to the papacy of John Paul II.) Mr. Bolton said the church was immediately receptive to the idea of working together, though he had to make eight visits to Rome to discuss the show. And because of concerns about display and security, the loan contract was not signed until last week.
Asked if he had met the pope or knew whether he had approved the show, Mr. Bolton said he had had no contact with him, and did not have any idea if he was involved.
Greg Burke, the director of the Holy See press office, said: “The Roman Catholic Church has been producing and promoting beautiful works of art for centuries. Most people have experienced that through religious paintings and architecture. This is another way of sharing some of that beauty that rarely gets seen.”

The Vatican garments will be separated from the rest of the fashion in the exhibition, out of respect for the fact that they are still working garments and, presumably, to defray criticisms that could incur if a visitor were to see, for example, a sacristy robe next to a Jean Paul Gaultier dress with a chalice embroidered over the breasts.
Less has been done, seemingly, to defray the idea that Mr. Bolton’s definition of “fashion” is definitively Western. Save Isabel Toledo, who is Cuban-American, there are no South American or Latin American designers in the show, for example, though it is hard to imagine that no one else from that continent engaged with Catholic iconography. Challenged on the subject, he said he hoped to expand his purview in a future exhibition.
In any case, Mr. Bolton has been here before: In 2015, his show, “China Through the Looking Glass,” became the fifth-most-visited exhibition, despite accusations of skating over the surface of the issues it raised, underscoring for him the importance of tapping into the broader conversation. He followed it up with “Manus x Machina,” which examined the role of technology in fashion (and which became the Met’s seventh-most-visited show); and then “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between,” the Costume Institute’s first retrospective of a living designer since 1983. Though it was widely praised, Ms. Kawakubo is a less obviously buzzy choice, and the show and the attendance were smaller.
Which may partly explain why the museum decided to roll the dice with this show. The last time this many Vatican garments made their way across the ocean, in 1983 for “The Vatican Collections,” the exhibition became the third-most-visited in museum history, with 896,743 attendees.
“Heavenly Bodies” is being sponsored by Versace, which makes sense given the brand’s incorporation of Catholic iconography into its vernacular, as well as by Christine and Stephen A. Schwarzman (and also, as usual, by Condé Nast). Mr. Schwarzman is chairman of Blackstone, the private equity group that bought 20 percent of Versace in 2014.

Two years ago, Mr. Schwarzman and his wife donated $40 million to the Inner-City Scholarship Fund, an initiative from the archdiocese of New York to provide financial support for underprivileged children attending Catholic schools. The former J.P. Morgan banker Jimmy Lee once told The New Yorker that Mr. Schwarzman had raised more money for the Catholic Archdiocese of New York than any other Jew.
Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzman will be honorary chairs of the opening night gala, along with Anna Wintour, the artistic director of Condé Nast and a museum trustee; Ms. Versace; Amal Clooney; and Rihanna. The last two are not exactly known for their religious bent, unlike pop stars who have made their Catholicism a subtext of their work and look, like Lady Gaga and Madonna, though they are both recognized for their fashion influence. (Rihanna is, by the by, a star of “Ocean’s 8,” the coming movie with a heist scene that takes place at the Met Gala.)
An invitation will be extended to Cardinal Dolan. Everyone is hoping he will attend.
An earlier version of this article misstated a former title of Daniel H. Weiss, now president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When Thomas P. Campbell resigned as the museum’s director in February, Mr. Weiss was its president, not its chief financial officer.

Ivory Tower 
By                     
 JAMES RYERSON
 
OCT. 20, 2017

The philosopher Tim Crane is an atheist. Though educated in a Catholic environment, he has come to believe that nothing exists beyond the world of everyday experience and scientific explanation — nothing transcendent. Some people look around and think, This can’t be all there is. Crane is not one of those people. That he avows atheism, as opposed to agnosticism, does not strike him as presumptuous or arrogant. He has considered the relevant evidence and arguments as best he can and drawn the most reasonable-seeming conclusion. What more is a thinker supposed to do? He is convinced religious believers are wrong.
But his qualm is not with them. As he explains in his lucid and thoughtful book THE MEANING OF BELIEF: Religion From an Atheist’s Point of View (Harvard University, $24.95), he is more troubled by some of his fellow atheists — specifically, those who campaign against religion as an irrational vestige of primitive thought outmoded by modern science. A notable feature of this campaign, Crane observes, has been its general failure to change the minds of religious people. Maybe those people are just foolish. Or maybe, as Crane is inclined to think, they do not recognize themselves or their beliefs in the picture of religion under attack. The atheists miss their target because they are aiming elsewhere. And because they fail to understand what religion is, they lack a suitably “realistic and feasible way to relate” to people of faith — which is to say, most people.
In a spirit of reconciliation, Crane proposes to paint a more accurate picture of religion for his fellow unbelievers. Religion is an immense, sprawling and variegated affair. Any attempt to define it, however comprehensive, will omit some aspects, and most attempts to define it, however crude, will capture something. The name of the game is what you see as central. Crane resists the notion, common to combative atheists, that the core of religion is an archaic cosmology (beliefs about things like the origin of the universe and supernatural agents) grafted onto a moral code. If you conceive of religion this way, as bad science plus arbitrary injunctions, of course you will think it should be replaced by good science and rational ethics.
For Crane, the religious worldview is better understood as the combination of two attitudes. First: a sense of the transcendent, of an unseen moral order to the universe, often known as God. Second: an identification with a community that tries to “make sense of the world” by attempting to bring its members into alignment with this moral order through a tradition of narratives and rituals. Crane concedes there is a cosmology here; a belief in the transcendent is “a claim about the universe.” He also grants that religion, like science, is trying to explain things. But the kind of explanation and the kind of cosmology offered by religion, which does not “expect all aspects of the world to be intelligible,” are nothing like those of science, which strives to eliminate mystery.

The atheist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has suggested that the idea of God is a “hypothesis” about a supernatural agent, ventured as a possible account of perplexing natural phenomena. Crane disagrees. The god of actual religious people — the source of the unseen order that imbues everything with significance — is both vaguer and more nuanced than that. Science takes “complex or confusing things” and tries to explain them in terms of “simpler or clearer things.” God is not simple or clear. Religion isn’t supposed to be a neat explanation of causal forces. It’s supposed to be a difficult explanation of the meaning of life. This explanation, Crane contends, is destined to be forever incomplete, always a struggle to fathom, not because it is missing some key facts, but because it involves “attempts to encounter” the transcendent.
Crane himself thinks there is no transcendent reality, but he knows there can be no proof of this. Given the ineluctable enigma of existence, he believes religion can be a rational, “intelligible human reaction to the mystery of the world.”
This picture of religion would no doubt strike the sociologist Christian Smith as “too cognitive, cerebral, intellectualist.” In his substantial, richly informed book RELIGION: What It Is, How It Works, and Why It Matters (Princeton University, $35), Smith offers a social scientific theory that disputes the notion, advanced by titans of social thought like Clifford Geertz and Max Weber, that religion is a cultural meaning system. “Religion is not at heart a set of replies to existential questions,” Smith writes, “even if it often involves this.”

For Smith, the paradigmatic expression of religion is something like praying to God to cure your wife’s cancer, or beseeching a cloud spirit to bring rain to your withering crops. Having surveyed religious traditions across the world and throughout history, he sees religion, at its core, as a set of “culturally prescribed practices” that aim to help people access “superhuman powers” in the hope of “realizing human goods” and avoiding bad things, typically “in conditions and situations they cannot control and with problems that they cannot solve.” Smith is quick to acknowledge that this is not all religion provides, nor the sole reason people practice religion. But he maintains it is the “central” reason. And unlike other things religion does, like providing an identity (which a profession can also do) or seeking existential meaning (which philosophy can also do), it is “unique to religion.”
Advertisement
A methodological hazard of discussing religion at this level of abstraction is the need, as Crane says, “to generalize the views of billions of people.” Smith hopes to avoid this difficulty by focusing less on subjective religious belief and more on public religious practices, which are “more or less objective.” This has allowed him, he believes, to focus on what religion is. He distinguishes this from what religion can do, its “secondary outgrowths” (things like fostering identity, meaning, community and so on). Though these derivative features are “often crucial” for the personal experience and institutional strength of religion, they do not constitute its “ultimate raison d’être.”
Smith’s is a theoretical work, but he provides ample illustrations of his theory, including religious traditions that might at first seem like counterexamples, such as American Protestant evangelicalism, which stresses the importance of beliefs and attitudes over rituals and customs. In all cases, he finds formalized calls for heavenly assistance, often involving this-worldly concerns like financial security and family health, to be central. Worries about things like the meaning of life and the problem of evil are peripheral. “If religion could not promise the help of superhuman powers,” he concludes, “then religion would not exist.”
At some point in the distant past, of course, religion did not exist. The story of its emergence in the universe, and the significance of this story for our understanding of the nature of religion, are the subject of THE NEW COSMIC STORY: Inside Our Awakening Universe (Yale University, $25), by the theologian John F. Haught. Like Crane and Smith, he takes a “generalized approach” to religion, focusing on what all such traditions have in common. Unlike Crane and Smith, he sees religion as something whose journey, like that of the rest of the universe described by modern science, is “unfinished,” and hence whose nature must be understood, in part, in terms of where it may be headed.
Haught describes religion as the “anticipation of a rightness that is now mostly out of range.” This formulation resembles Crane’s, with its transcendent moral order both everywhere present and agonizingly beyond reach. But Haught, a man of faith, disagrees with Crane that religion’s truths will necessarily remain so remote. Ever since the Big Bang, we have seen the emergence of matter, then life, then conscious life — and then, most notably, in Haught’s estimation, the human consciousness of “interior striving” that finds its zenith in our “spiritual adventures.”
Who knows what advances in religion the next stage of the universe’s evolution will bring? Thanks to modern science, Haught argues, we know “the cosmic story is far from over” and can look “patiently and expectantly ahead for a possible meaning to it all.” Should such a cosmic gift come to pass, it would amount to a salvation of the physical world, not a deliverance from it — a kind of redemption perhaps even an atheist could live with.

Though Monika Bulaj grew up in Communist Poland, she was nonetheless a devoutly Catholic child who studied mystics and dreamed of a life as a cloistered nun. But her teenage discovery that her grandmotherâs town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world. 
Today she no longer considers herself religious âin terms of attending church,â but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries.  âMy work can be a kind of prayer,â she said. âWith time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God â but God in people.â
Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, âWhere Gods Whisper,â published by Contrasto Books. 
She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a âkind of moral  and ethical necessity.â
As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians,  Jews and Muslim Tatars.  She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.  
Her grandparentsâ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. âIn one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,â she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer. 
She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.
âBeyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,â she wrote in âGodâs People: A Travel Into Another Europe,â an earlier book. âIn winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.â 
Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmotherâs town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust.  It was the townâs âtotal silenceâ about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.
Ms. Bulajâs photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too. 
âI photograph instinctively,â she said. âI am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.â

(SALT LAKE CITY) — The Mormon church has made history and injected diversity into a top leadership panel by selecting the first-ever Latin American apostle and the first-ever apostle of Asian ancestry.
The selections of Ulisses Soares of Brazil and Gerrit W. Gong, a Chinese-American, were announced Saturday morning at the start of a twice-annual conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
They join a panel called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that before Saturday was made up entirely of white men from the U.S. with the exception of one German, Dieter Uchtdorf.
The all-male panel sits below church President Russell M. Nelson and his two counselors and helps set church policy and oversees the faith’s business interests.
The selections of Soares and Gong are likely to trigger applause from a contingent of Mormons who were anxious to see the faith’s global footprint represented in leadership. Soares and Gong were serving in a lower-level leadership panel for the church.

While the majority of Americans consistently report that they disapprove of President Trump, and millions rally to protest the Muslim Ban, attacks on the Affordable Care Act and anti-immigrant policies, one group has not wavered in its support of Trump: his faith advisors. Jerry Falwell, Jr. has celebrated Trump as a “dream president” and Franklin Graham said “God’s hand intervened” to elect him. At the 2018 National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., several speakers said no President in American history has done as much as this one to promote “religious freedom.”
To many within and beyond the faith community, these preachers’ claims raise eyebrows. How do Christian ministers reconcile the Jesus who said “Love your enemy” with a President whose policy is to strike back at all critics? Why would people who claim to stand for family values so uncritically support a thrice-married man who according to Ronan Farrow’s reporting for the New Yorker set up complex legal arrangements to cover up multiple affairs throughout his current marriage?
Eighty percent of white evangelicals voted for and, by and large, continue to support President Trump. To almost everyone else in America, this seems like a fundamental contradiction. But to Trump’s faithful, it is Providence at work in human history. They believe God is making America great again through an imperfect human agent. And like any true believers, they will not be moved.
As a preacher who grew up in the South during the Moral Majority movement, I know where my sisters and brothers are coming from. They feel that the “liberal media” and “secular humanists” seek to embarrass their heroes for standing by this President and therefore only confirm their conviction that they are an embattled minority, up against great odds with none but God on their side.
Trump is far from the first person to feed us this lie. In the 19th century, when black and white people built a moral movement in America to abolish slavery, plantation owners paid preachers to write theological defenses of white supremacy. Human bondage wasn’t only allowable for slaveholder religion. It was reflective of God’s design — a righteous order in society to be preserved at all costs.
Slavery went away, but this peculiar American faith did not. Historians refer to the movement to end Reconstruction in the South as “the Redemption movement” because Southern preachers told their people that God was redeeming them from Northern aggression and “Negro rule” when President Rutherford B. Hayes removed federal troops from the South in 1877. By 1896, “separate but equal” was the law of the land. A celebrated preacher of the early 20th century, Thomas Dixon, wrote a bestselling novel glorifying the Ku Klux Klan as champions of morality; by 1915, it was a major motion picture, The Birth of a Nation.
In America’s Gilded Age, slaveholder religion went national, blessing an alliance between industrial capital and white nationalism. When corporate tycoons lost credibility after the Great Depression, members of the national Chamber of Commerce paid The Birth of a Nation director D.W. Griffith’s pastor, the Rev. James Fifield, to popularize a 20th-century version of slaveholder religion that blessed the market and cursed those who preached a Social Gospel. Like the Redemption movement of the previous century, this campaign for “One Nation Under God” promised to save America from the “immorality” of the New Deal, Communism and the Civil Rights movement.
America’s long history of slaveholder religion makes clear that the faith of Trump’s preachers is not new. But it is also not the only faith in this land. Writing in the 19th century, when slaveholder religion was still taking root in white Americans’ consciousness, Frederick Douglass said, “Between the Christianity of the slaveholder and the Christianity of Christ, I see the widest possible difference.”
The faith that drove Douglass and thousands of others to risk all in the fight for abolition has also been passed down, one generation to the next, in the American story. Preachers like Sojourner Truth and J.W. Hood rallied the faithful to fight for Reconstruction after the Civil War, just as Social Gospelers were motivated by a moral vision, and the Civil Rights movement was sustained by the preaching of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the freedom songs that flowed out of Southern churches into the streets and jails. This faith is with us still in churches that offer sanctuary to immigrant neighbors facing deportation and in the Moral Movement led by the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II.
If slaveholder religion is still with us in the 21st century, the moral force of this other tradition is with us as well. To distinguish between the two is to make clear that people of faith have a choice to make. Faith that props up extremism isn’t the only religion in our public life, but our history makes clear that slaveholder religion will dominate unless people of faith are willing to put our bodies on the line to insist on a better way.", religion

In the United States, Easter is marked by egg hunts and baskets filled sweets and other presents. In 2017, a Wallethub report estimated that the country would spend a total of $2.58 billion on candy and more than $3 billion on gifts. The holiday’s most prominent symbol is the Easter bunny, an idea supposedly introduced to America by German immigrants.But in other countries, the religious day celebrating Jesus’ resurrection looks much different. Explore some unique Easter traditions around the world:

Every year, thousands of spectators gather in the town of Bessieres, located in southwestern France, to watch cooks prepare a 15,000 egg omelette. Another unique tradition in France is what is known as ""flying bells."" Between Good Friday and Easter Sunday morning, no church bells ring. According to French Catholic custom, the bells fly to the Vatican to be blessed by the Pope. When the bells return, they bring candy to the children.

Starting at 11 a.m. on Holy Saturday, you probably don’t want to be walking through the streets of the Greek city of Corfu. Residents throw pottery from their windows in a noisy tradition that has been linked to a Venetian ritual in which people threw their possessions out the window in hopes of receiving new ones.
(Bengt Nyman)
For children in Sweden, Easter looks much like Halloween in the U.S. Beginning on Thursday, children dress up as Easter witches and travel door-to-door collecting candy in return for paintings and drawings. Finnish children follow a similar tradition, but they hand neighbors catkin branches and recite healthy wishes instead of artwork.

On Good Friday, Bermudians fly kites, many of which they make themselves from paper tissue, wood and string. The tradition is thought to have stemmed from a Sunday school teacher, who used a kite to describe Christ’s ascension to Heaven. Bermudians also enjoy codfish cakes and hot cross buns to celebrate the holiday.

Families in Poland fill ""blessing baskets"" with traditional Easter foods, including a cake shaped like a lamb. The baskets are then blessed at Mass on Easter Sunday and are enjoyed after the service. Every member of a family tastes a bite of each blessed food.

The pope's stance on five hot-button issues five years into his papacy.
Pope Francis’ Popularity
Pope Francis has reached the 5-year mark.(L'Osservatore Romano/ANSA via AP)
Five years into his papacy, Pope Francis' favorability rating remains nearly unchanged.
According to a recent Pew Research Center report, 84 percent of Roman Catholics have a favorable opinion of the pope, down only 1 percentage point from the end of his election year.

Outsiders Keep the Faith 
But among Catholic Republicans, it's a different story. His favorability ratings have dropped by 11 percentage points since 2014, when nine in 10 Catholic Republicans had a favorable view of the pope. More than half of Catholic Republicans in the Pew survey say Francis is ""too liberal,"" and only 37 percent say he represents a ""major change for the better.""
Throughout his papacy, Francis has been recognized for his more ""liberal"" views regarding some of the nation's most contested topics, from climate change to immigration and divorce. While some conservatives might not agree with his stances, the Catholic community's views as a whole seem to be shifting with him. 
1. Homosexuality
The pope made headlines in 2013 when he expressed a more open stance on homosexuality than his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.
""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" Francis said in response to a question about the supposed ""gay lobby."" 
The pope's position is reflected by Catholics' evolving views on same-sex marriage. More than two-thirds of U.S. Catholics say they favor same-sex marriage, compared to 54 percent in 2012, according to the Pew report. Still, 44 percent say Francis has only done ""a little"" to make the Catholic Church more accepting of homosexuality.

2. Climate Change 
Francis has taken a firm stance on climate change, calling on people to accept scientific evidence and preserve the environment. When President Donald Trump visited the Vatican in 2017, the pope presented him with a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter, ""Laudato Si,"" which expresses these opinions. Top Vatican officials even asked Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.
A year after the release of ""Laudato Si,"" 60 percent of Catholics agreed that temperatures are getting warmer in response to higher concentrations of heat-trapping gases, and that this is largely a result of human activity. A slightly lower share – 58 percent – of all U.S. adults agreed with these statements, according to the Georgetown University poll. 
We need only to take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is falling into serious disrepair. #LaudatoSi
3. Abortion
In another groundbreaking move, Francis announced in 2016 that priests can grant absolution for abortion. Though he considers abortions a ""grave sin,"" he said ""there is no sin that God's mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.""
Catholics' views on abortion haven't changed as drastically as those on homosexuality, but the percentage of those who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases jumped by 4 percentage points, to reach 53 percent in 2017.
(Data: Pew Research Center; Casey Leins for USN&WR)
4. Divorce
Francis has given Catholics, who are civilly divorced but cannot remarry in the eyes of the church without an annulment, a second chance at marriage with a streamlined annulment process.
Despite Francis' efforts, 38 percent of Catholics said they would like to see the pope do more in the area of divorce and remarriage. Only 17 percent said they don't want him to do more or would like to see him do less in the Pew poll.
The divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church. They are not excommunicated.
5. Atheism
The pope has preached acceptance throughout his papacy, even saying those who do not believe in God can reach heaven if they lead good lives. In a May 2013 homily, Francis didn't mince words: ""The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone! 'Father, the atheists?' Even the atheists. Everyone!""

The newspaper publisher removed the husband’s name because he believed it was 'contrary to God's word.'
Couple Accuses Paper of Discrimination
Many people have since written negative reviews about the newspaper on its Facebook page.(Nodar Chernishev/EyeEm/Getty Images)
A same-sex couple in Dallas is accusing a newspaper of discrimination after the paper omitted one of their names in a family member's obituary.

The 50 Shades of States
After Barry Giles' mother, Brenda Light, died in February, the local newspaper in Olton, Texas, removed his husband's name from her obituary, citing ""religious and ethical reasons,"" Fox 4 News reported. 
In the original obituary sent to The Olton Enterprise, Giles wrote, ""Those left to cherish her memory include her son, Barry Giles and his husband, John Gambill of Dallas."" Giles and Gambill have been together for 31 years.
However, when it was published, there was no mention of Gambill. 
""It wiped John completely off the picture like he didn't exist,"" Giles told Fox 4 (KDFW-TV). 
Gambill told the station Light was ""like my second mom"" and he was upset to see he was cut from the obituary. The couple immediately called the newspaper's publisher, Phillip Hamilton.
""We're human beings like anyone else,"" Giles said. ""We have feelings. We have relationships, whether he agrees with them or not.""
When Gambill asked why his name had been left out, he says Hamilton told him, ""Because I wanted to."" 
In addition to a newspaper publisher, Hamilton is also a Baptist pastor, according to Fox 4. 
""It is my religious conviction that a male cannot have a husband. It is also my belief that to publish anything contrary to God's Word on this issue would be to publish something in the newspaper that is not true,"" Hamilton said in a statement to Fox 4.
""The newspaper respects the first amendment rights of those who express such opinions. The newspaper's decision to edit the obituary is both ethical and lawful. It would be unethical to publish a news item that is known by the editor to be false. Based on the truth found in the Word of God, I could not in good conscience identify Mr. Gambill as the husband of Mr. Giles,"" the statement continued.

The paper has since faced criticism on its Facebook page.
""It's incomprehensible that Philip Hamilton thinks his job is to edit a personal obituary. The newspaper is not a religious publication. A personal obituary is a tribute to their life and to the people they loved and cherished,"" one user commented. ""These people were family and Hamilton took it upon himself to delete that part and person out because he felt his personal opinion came before the memory of another person and their family. Very unprofessional."" 
The couple is looking into what legal options they can take. The full, unedited obituary was published in other local newspapers.

Graham was the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history.
Evangelist Rev. Billy Graham Dies at 99

Rev. Billy Graham, the charismatic, global Christian evangelist leader who became a spiritual adviser to U.S. presidents, passed away on Wednesday at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, according to a spokesman from his organization. He was 99.
William Franklin ""Billy"" Graham Jr. was born on Nov. 7, 1918, on a farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. He attended Florida Bible Institute in St. Petersburg, where Graham was ordained as a Southern Baptist clergyman in 1938, and he received a degree in anthropology from Wheaton College. He met his wife, Ruth McCue Bell, at Wheaton, and they were married from 1943 until her death in 2007.

Secular and Religious Leaders Pay Tribute to…
Following his graduation from Wheaton, Graham gained national attention as a rising evangelism star during his series of tent rallies across the country that he called his “Canvas Cathedral” campaign after William Randolph Hearst and others publicized his Los Angeles stop. 
“Are you frustrated, bewildered, dejected, breaking under the strains of life?” Mr. Graham would frequently ask his audiences. “Then listen for a moment to me. Say yes to the savior tonight, and in a moment you will know such comfort as you have never known.”
He made his first White House visit in 1950 to then-President Harry S. Truman, and he earned the nickname ""America's Pastor"" as he became a spiritual adviser to U.S. presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush.
With his powerful voice and goal to help people establish a personal relationship with God, “America’s Pastor” expanded his campaign around the world, drawing crowds of hundreds to thousands from the '50s onward as he traveled to Central and South America; Europe; North Africa; India; the Philippines; Hong Kong; Taiwan and Korea to deliver his spiritual message. 
""My home is in Heaven,"" Graham habitually said. ""I'm just traveling through this world.""
He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983 from President Ronald Reagan and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1996, two of the highest awards given to an American civilian.
In 1993, Graham announced he had Parkinson's disease. His son, William Franklin ""Franklin"" Graham III, took over the Billy Graham Evangelistic Organization as CEO in 2000 and president in 2001.
The elder Graham preached to an estimated 200 million people in 185 countries around the world during his lifetime, according to the Associated Press. Stepping down from his ministerial association, Graham said he was prepared to finish his ministry whenever the time came.
“Most of my life has already been lived,” he said, according to the Washington Post. “I’ll be glad when the moment comes when the Lord calls me to heaven. I get tired down here sometimes.”

In April 2016, Rikkyo University in Japan added a prayer room for Muslim students.  (Rikkyo University)
When Indonesian graduate student Nila Purwanti, who is Muslim, wants to perform her five daily prayers, she heads to the on-campus prayer room at Rikkyo University in Japan. The university established the room in April 2016 for all students, particularly its Muslim international students.
Building prayer rooms is just one way global universities are working to accommodate undergraduate and graduate international students of multiple faiths.
""It can be a consideration for students when they choose a university to look at the provided facilities,"" says Purwanti. Kazunori Yamaguchi, vice president for International Advancement at Rikkyo, says he hopes the prayer room will also serve as a center for all students to understand and appreciate cultural diversity.

    connect with a religious community as an international student.]
For prospective international students considering a global university, here are three ways institutions provide religious accommodations.
• Religious accommodation policies: Most global universities have religious accommodation policies in place to meet multifaith students' needs. Prospective students can typically find these policies on a university's website.
For example, the University of Denver's religious accommodation policy grants students excused absences from class or other organized activities to observe religious holy days.
Jessica Moody, senior policy adviser for the United Kingdom's Equality Challenge Unit, which supports equality and diversity at U.K. higher education institutions, says the country's laws require universities to consider students' religious needs in their equality strategies – initiatives that seek to provide equal treatment and opportunity – and their support services.
She says prospective international students can also look for information about chaplains, or religious directors of various faiths, on university websites by searching the term ""chaplaincy.""
The University of Southern California has about 50 religious directors, or faith leaders, including the dean of religious life who is Hindu. Other schools with multifaith chaplains include the University of Queensland Australia, McGill University in Canada and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.
At the University of Denver, chaplain Gary Brower, who supports students of all faiths, says the school handles many religious accommodation requests on a case-by-case basis.
""For example, if a student from a particular Buddhist sect needs to be able to burn incense and/or light candles – the latter, at least, forbidden in our residence halls – we either might release them from their housing contract or find another building where they may practice, as needed,"" says Brower.
• Prayer rooms and facilities: Many global universities, like Canada's University of Alberta and Australia's Victoria University provide separate areas designated for prayer, reflection and meditation.
""We seek to value and make space for all religious and nonreligious identities on campus,"" says James Walters, chaplain and director of the London School of Economics and Political Science's Faith Centre.
He says the LSE Faith Centre hosts diverse religious on-campus activities, such as Islamic prayer, Sikh meditation, Kosher lunches and Catholic mass. He says that the center seeks to ""promote religious literacy and foster interfaith leadership to build bridges.""
George Mason University in Virginia and Canada's University of Regina have installed special sinks for Muslims to wash for prayer. South Korea's Ewha Womans University provides accommodations for Muslim students in the dormitories.
""We have installed squatting toilets and retractable shower heads next to the toilet allowing students to wash themselves right after,"" Aileen Nam, an associate at the Office of International Affairs at Ewha, said via email.
Nam says the university also has one prayer/meditation room in each of the two main dormitories that international students reside in. Though Indian national Torunika Roy, a Hindu, prays in her room, she says she appreciates the inclusion of prayer rooms at Ewha.
""In Hinduism, we believe that a prayer room or temples have some kind of positivity that can help people with their problems,"" says Roy, an undergrad majoring in international studies.
[Read about
    ways U.S. colleges work to support international students.]
• Student clubs: Prospective international students can also explore faith-based clubs as an opportunity to make friends and become active members of a community while they adapt to a new school and possibly new country.
For example, at Ewha, Nam says the school has 15 registered religion-based student clubs, such as the Ewha Won Buddhist Student Society.
Moody says U.K. universities typically have societies for different religions and joining them can help students share experiences, celebrate key festivals and meet new people. And she says if one doesn't exist, students can start their own faith-based club.
[Explore how 
    U.S. universities offer international students a taste of home.]
Through clubs, students can also be advocates for change. The Muslim Student Association at the University of Alberta is credited with pushing for the school's Multi-Faith Prayer and Meditation Space, which was established in early 2017.
Similarly, Sadia Farah, a nursing major and Muslim Student Association member at St. Catherine University in Minnesota, recently authored the school's new religious accommodation policy, which allows students of all faiths to observe religious holidays without academic penalty.
Saudi student Rahma Abufoor did not expect to get Islamic holidays off at St. Catherine, a Catholic university, but says she welcomes the new policy. ""I feel that someone cares about me, because my faith is part of who I am,"" says Abufoor.
Moody says her organization is still working toward greater religious inclusion at U.K. universities. But she says international students can be a powerful force for change.
She encourages prospective international students: ""If you have questions or suggestions for your future university on meeting your needs: ask!""

Lucien Greaves, spokesman for The Satanic Temple, stands inside the group's headquarters in 2016. Missouri's Supreme Court has agreed to take on a Satanic Temple lawsuit over abortion rights in the state. Elise Amendola/AP
On its face, it sounds like the epitome of a frivolous, if not blasphemous, lawsuit: A group of Satanists in Missouri sued the state over its strict anti-abortion laws on religious-discrimination grounds. A state trial court agreed, sort of, dismissing the case not long after it was filed in 2015.
But skepticism about The Satanic Temple's suit against Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, and Show-Me State administrators ended when the Satanists appealed, the state Supreme Court agreed to take the case – and, based on the arguments presented in court, experts say the Satanists could actually win.
[RELATED:
       Perkins: Trump Given a ‘Mulligan’ on Behavior]
       
If they prevail in the case, an organization named for the Dark Lord of the Underworld could upend a 2016 law requiring women to wait 72 hours before an abortion, forcing doctors to give women ultrasounds of the fetus and offering them literature declaring that ""life begins at conception."" 
Although the state's highest court won't rule for several weeks, the group has already claimed a big victory: It says the state did a 180 on the ultrasounds during oral arguments, acknowledging that they're voluntary and not mandatory.
""It's kind of ironic,"" says Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor who specializes in women's rights issues. ""This is showing that people on both sides of the political spectrum can use religious freedom"" to challenge laws they don't like.
Adding to the irony: Members of The Satanic Temple don't really believe in Satan. 
Though the organization is described as dedicated to Satanic practice and promotion of Satanic rights, it's actually a progressive political organization that sees the biblical Satan as a metaphor, and their mission as rebellion against tyranny.
Its mission statement calls for members to be ""politically aware"" and ""encourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense and justice, and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will."" The organization says it has worked for women's rights and against persecution of gays, corporal punishment in schools and insertion of religion in public life, among other progressive causes.
Regardless of the outcome, the Mary Doe-Satanic Temple case could provide a template for the political left to battle so-called ""religious freedom"" laws - red-state statutes passed in recent years that liberal critics say force conservative Christian values on society writ large, an escalation of the so-called culture wars.
""Oh, yeah, I can see it working"" in other states, says Ziegler. ""One hundred percent – especially if they [the Satanists] win. There will be other lawsuits like this"" in states where the higher courts tilt to the left, and may want to prove a point about the use of religion to form public policy. 
""I think this is sort of a signal if we're going to have a robust religious [influence on] jurisprudence, it's going to cut both ways,"" she says.

       Evangelical Leader: Trump a 'Changed Person']
       
At issue is the case of Mary Doe, an anonymous Southern Missouri woman who in March 2015 learned she was pregnant. She saved up enough money to travel to St. Louis and rent a hotel room, then made an appointment at a clinic in the city. 
On May 8, 2015, Doe ""made her first visit to the abortion clinic, and delivered a letter purporting to waive the Informed Consent Law requirements according to her Satanic beliefs,"" according to a case summary in the court file. Among those beliefs: ""That a non-viable fetus is not a separate human being but is part of her body and that abortion of a non-viable fetus does not terminate the life of a separate, unique, living human being.""
The clinic refused to give her an abortion, ""but it offered Doe the Booklet and gave Doe an ultrasound"" and had her listen to the fetal heartbeat, as required under state law. 
Having read the booklet, Doe had to wait 72 hours before trying again, according to the documents, during which she ""alleges that she felt guilt and shame."" She returned to the clinic and had the procedure – but not before suing the state during the waiting period, contending the requirements of the state's Informed Consent Law violates her rights under Missouri's Religious Freedom Restoration act. 
The text of that law says that the state cannot ""substantially burden a person's exercise of religion"" – in this case, Doe's membership in the Satanic Temple – unless it is furthering a ""compelling government interest"" and acting in the least restrictive way possible. The state attorney general's office, which is defending the abortion law, argues that Missouri's religious freedom laws don't apply in this case. 
During oral arguments, the state argued that Doe and the Temple failed to show or argue any conflict between her ""putative Satanic beliefs"" and the state's law. At the same time, one of the appellate judges noted that the clinic only had to give Doe the booklet; the law doesn't require doctors to make her read it. 
But James MacNaughton, an attorney for Doe, reportedly told the state Supreme Court that the government ""should not be in the business of preaching"" to its citizens. 
""It is a bedrock principle of our culture (and) of our country that we choose for ourselves what to believe by way of religious beliefs,"" he said. ""It's not the business of government to tell us that.""
The case took a sharp turn, however, when John Sauer, the state's solicitor general, told the court that the ultrasound and fetal heartbeat components of the law were voluntary. 
[RELATED:
       Religion Is Root of World's Problems, Study Says]
       
After the hearing, the Temple released audio of the hearing in which Sauer acknowledges that, in his interpretation, the law's requirements have been met if a woman is merely offered the ""opportunity"" to listen to the fetal heartbeat; if she declines, she doesn't have to have the ultrasound. 
Though the Missouri Supreme Court will decide the case in the coming weeks, Ziegler, the Florida State law professor, believes the Satanists have reached an important milestone. 
""A lot of pro-choice groups haven't put emphasis on religious claims because they've been defeated by the Supreme Court,"" which in the past has rejected spiritual beliefs as a justification for abortion, she says. 
But the Satanic Temple's arguments in the Missouri case, Ziegler adds, ""got a big boost"" from the Supreme Court's 2014 ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, in which the justices ruled that the craft-supply store chain – founded and owned by evangelical Christians – didn't have to abide by an Affordable Care Act mandate to offer birth control to its employees. 
That ruling ""can cut the other way and it can benefit other parties"" Ziegler says. Other abortion rights and progressive organizations, she says, likely are watching the Satanic Temple case closely, and could decide to use the religious-freedom argument in other states. 
""I think it's telling that the [Missouri Supreme Court] is taking this seriously, and Missouri is backing off [forcing women] to have an ultrasound"" before an abortion, says Ziegler. ""I think people before were treating [the case] as a joke. Now, it's not a joke anymore.""

Raised as a conservative, Sunni Muslim girl in Canada, Yasmine Mohammed said she was taught to always be in fight mode. 
""The first thing Islam teaches you is to not question, but follow,"" she says. And what she had to follow was a ""Muslim supremacy ideology"" that called for violence against anyone who fell out of line and full armies prepared to join the fight when the caliphate was to rise.
Systematic suppression of critical thinking is what makes Muslims ripe to join groups like the Islamic State group or become suicide bombers without questioning the motives of their directives, she says. 
As a radical sect of Buddhist nationalists persecute the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict wages on and a film challenging the Orthodox Church spurs violent protests in Russia, it seems that asserting sovereignty is the only thing the world's religions can agree on today.
In a recent Best Countries survey of more than 21,000 people from all regions of the world, the majority of respondents identified religion as the ""primary source of most global conflict today."" 
[RELATED:

Spiritual beliefs create an inherent ""us vs. them"" scenario, experts say.
""When societies shatter, they generally shatter along tribal lines. People are seeing themselves as irretrievably different from their neighbors,"" says Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and philosopher who has published books on Islam and the conflict between religion and science.
The divisions created by religion are deeper and potentially more harmful than those formed through other aspects of identity such as race, nationality or political affiliations because they confront individuals with differing opinions on the ultimate purpose of life, experts say. And more than 80 percent of those surveyed said that religious beliefs guide a person's behavior.
""Religion often becomes the master variable,"" Harris says. ""It provides a unique reward structure. If you believe that the thoughts you harbor in this life and the doctrines you adhere to spell the difference between an eternity spent in fire or one spent on the right hand of God, that raises the stakes beyond any other reward structure on earth.""
Tribal tendencies are natural for humans who need groups and community to survive. But the driving forces behind especially alienating, fundamentalist beliefs are a combination of nature and nurture, experts say.
“Any beliefs that concern the sacred are integral to people’s identities,” says Andrew Tix, a psychology professor at Normandale Community College whose nationally recognized research focuses on religion and spirituality. “People differ in how much they’re threatened when the sacred is brought into question.” 
He points to psychology’s Big Five theory in which openness to experience is one of five key personality traits that is influenced by genetics and shaped by experiences.
Some people have found ways to “hold their beliefs more lightly and with a sense of mystery,” he says. They would score high on ‘openness,’ while fundamentalists who hold their beliefs with heavy conviction would more likely score low.
Religious communities teach different ways of responding to criticism of their identity, Tix says, but it comes down to the notion of threatened egotism. 
The stronger a person’s convictions in their identity – of which religion is often a key part – the more likely they are to be violent when their identity is threatened. 
The Muslim identity surrounding Mohammed in Canada's British Columbia was strong. She was beaten for not memorizing the Koran and married to a member of al-Qaida as a teenager.

But after taking a religion course at college, Mohammed said the unease she had always felt with what she was told to believe finally started to take shape. 
In voicing her newfound convictions to her family, she immediately became part of “them” instead of “us.” The fight turned against her. She says her family disowned her and threatened to have her killed. She fled to different parts of Canada, changed her and her child’s names and says she feels lucky the death threat has so far only been a threat.
It is only in comparison with modern Islam that modern Christianity and other religions appear more benign, says Sam Harris, who is very publicly atheist. 
“It’s more than inconvenient that these old [religious] books support things like slavery and the killing of women who are not virgins on their wedding night,” he says. “None of these books is the best we have on anything we care about. All could be improved with editing, and that should banish any notion that they are the product of omniscience.”
But religion is not going away. 
Estimates from Pew Research Center predict that the worldwide population of religiously unaffiliated people will shrink from about 16 percent in 2010 to 13 percent in 2050. In the same time frame, the share of Muslims is predicted to grow from 23 percent to 30 percent of the world’s population.
Experts agree that finding a human connection at some level can help build empathy and bridge the gap between conflicting ideologies and identities.
In many Muslim-majority nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, religion is directly tied to national policy and politics.
For 18 years, the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy, founded by Douglas Johnston, has facilitated faith-based dialogue to find commonalities in these conflicting sides.
“What you’re doing is shifting accountability from an ideology or political movement to god. If you do that, you tend to find that people behave nicer,” Johnston says. “It’s incumbent upon all of us to search our beliefs, our instincts and the rest of it and do what we can to be agents of reconciliation.”

LIMA, Peru – Since his surprise election as pope by an enclave of cardinals nearly five years ago, Pope Francis has been on a one-man campaign to shake up the Catholic Church, going out of his way to replace the ostentatious rituals and moralizing of some of his predecessors with an image of humility and compassion.
He has vowed ""zero tolerance"" for the long-running sore of clerical pedophilia, insisted that he is not qualified to judge the gay community, expressed his ""closeness"" to non-believers ""searching for truth, goodness and beauty"" in their own way, and washed the feet of convicts and the homeless.
Yet once he touches down here on Jan. 18 for the second leg of his Latin American tour, Francisco – as he is commonly referred to in Latin America – may also be getting an insight into the resistance from within the Church establishment to his reforming agenda, and the behind-the-scenes power struggles between traditional and progressive wings of the clergy.

If visiting Chile – where Francis' personal popularity has taken a huge hit for his alleged mishandling of the Rev. Fernando Karadima sex abuse case – on the first leg of this tour was tough, then Peru, where the pope's itinerary includes a trip to the Amazon to meet indigenous communities, also presents its own challenges.
One of the pontiff's hosts here will be Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, the ultraconservative archbishop of Lima, who appears to represent everything that the pope is trying to change within the Church. Although he has avoided openly questioning Francis, Cipriani's public positions, and in particular his tone, on a host of issues places him starkly at odds with the pontiff.
Down the years, the archbishop has lambasted single mothers and even human rights activists, while calling the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to allow gay marriage ""tragic."" Cipriani has opposed abortion for rape victims by claiming that it was not proven that such pregnancies were unwanted, and questioned a monthly state pension of around $40 to some of Peru's poorest citizens on the grounds that it could deter thrift.
He has also long been openly sympathetic to Alberto Fujimori, Peru's autocratic hard right former president – many here call him a dictator – who was just pardoned, and released from jail, for crimes including stealing millions of dollars in public money and using death squads to target left-wing subversives.

The archbishop has even proven himself to be out of touch with technology, and particularly the younger generations, once launching an attack on the messaging app WhatsApp for its supposedly harmful social impacts. ""How many families break up through WhatsApp?"" he asked. ""You will say 'don't exaggerate,' that I am a retrograde … well, someone has to tell the truth.""
""The pope is very concerned for the poor. They are his priority. That is not something we see from Cipriani,"" says Ernesto Cavassa, a Jesuit priest and theologist who is rector at Lima's Antonio Ruiz de Montoya University, a leading Catholic school here.
Although he is not formally the head of the Church within Peru, Cipriani is the most high-profile cleric here and arguably the most influential in this deeply Catholic nation. He also has played an instrumental role in the handling of the Peruvian Church's best known pedophilia case, in a lay Catholic boy's association called Sodalicio de Vida Cristiana.
Sodalicio was set up to inculcate youngsters from the Peruvian elite with a particularly conservative strain of Catholicism, shaping them to then champion those values as adults. However, in recent years allegations have emerged that Sodalicio was a hotbed of pedophilia, including from the group's founder, Luis Fernando Figari.
Cipriani initially ignored the scandal and then decried Sodalicio's critics as ""false moralists who want to mistreat the Church."" The Vatican eventually ordered Figari to live a Spartan life of penitence in Rome – a move that was heavily criticized for putting him beyond the reach of Peruvian prosecutors. But then last week, it took direct control of the organization in an apparent attempt to pre-empt controversy during the pope's visit here.

Although the Vatican's move came years too late for many, Francis does get a partial defense from one unlikely quarter, Pao Ugaz, an investigative journalist who co-authored the book ""Half Monks, Half Soldiers."" Featuring survivors' testimonies, the book's publication first broke the Sodalicio scandal.
""The Vatican is set up so that the pope reigns but doesn't govern,"" she says when asked who is to blame for the years of delay in adequately handling the Sodalicio scandal. ""Francisco is much more political [than previous pontiffs] and he has more leverage but there is still a lot of resistance and it remains to be seen who will prevail.""
Others in Latin America, however, are less quick to give the pontiff a pass. Juan Enrique Pi, who heads the Iguales foundation in Chile, a LGBT activist group, believes that Francis and ecclesiastical traditionalists such as Cipriani have more in common than many believe.
""The church hierarchy in Chile has not changed a bit,"" Larrain says. ""It continues to be extremely conservative, and also to have a political agenda, speaking out in national debates against the recognition of the rights of lesbians, gays and trans people.""
[RELATED:
       Chile’s Shifting Social Mores]
       
""In that sense Francisco has not changed a thing. He has not done enough. His own agenda is contradictory. One day he says 'who am I to judge?' [homosexuals] and the next he is suggesting there is something intrinsically wrong with gay people.""
Cavassa, the Jesuit academic, says that on fundamental theological issues such as the right to life, including abortion, Francis is actually in agreement with Cipriani, and is something of a traditionalist, although his conciliatory messaging is in stark contrast to Cipriani's often strident sermonizing.
""It's a strong message [from Francis]. We are not used to it because for the last 30 or 35 years the church has had a different approach but it is not really new,"" Cavassa says. ""Of course, all of this is not readily accepted both within the church and outside it. There is resistance but Cipriani will receive the pope in the best way possible. They have focuses that are very different, but these differences are over specific, concrete things.""
But how those differences play out could yet prove critical for the future of the Church in Latin America, which, on current trends could one day cease to be the bastion of global Catholicism that it has been until now.
According to a study by Chilean pollsters Latinobarometro, the number of Latin Americans describing themselves as Catholic fell from 80 percent in 1996 to 59 percent last year. That is thanks both to evangelicals making inroads into the Church's flocks and to many Latin Americans simply moving away from religion altogether.
The Latinobarometro study even found that one country, Honduras, now appears to be the first country in Latin America where Catholics are outnumbered by other religions, with 39 percent describing themselves as evangelicals compared to 37 percent as Catholic.
With large and growing numbers of even devout Latin Americans ignoring the Church's teachings on a range of issues, particularly regarding sex and reproduction, Catholicism's future in the region could yet depend on Francis' ability to overcome clerical resistance from to his reforming drive.

                                | Jan. 8, 2018, at 12:21 p.m. 

JERUSALEM – After nearly a year on the job, Hana Mansour Khatib says she is already seeing the impact she can make as the first female judge in Israel's Islamic, or sharia court system. She says she has long witnessed many female plaintiffs remain quiet and instruct a lawyer or male relative to speak on their behalf in the Islamic courts, which handle marriage, divorce and other personal issues for Muslims here.
""But now, I have noticed that when women see me as the judge, they have more confidence to talk and speak up,"" says Khatib, adding that she also asks the many relatives who often accompany a divorcing couple to court to leave the room ""so the parties can talk honestly. I really encourage them to talk and I want to hear what they have to say, especially in these sensitive matters.""
In appointing Khatib, Israel joins a growing number of countries with Islamic courts with female judges. Her appointment also is significant here for the Jews and Christians, who, like Muslims, must marry and divorce through their respective religious authorities because civil marriage does not exist in Israel. Jewish and Christian legal authorities remain all male.

""The appointment of Khatib is wonderful proof that what is perceived as entrenched and immutable can in fact be changed,"" says Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, a law professor at Bar-Ilan University and vice president of the U.N. Committee on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women.
Khatib's judgeship comes at a time of rapid change for Israel's Arab minority, which makes up about 20 percent of the country's population. Recent years have seen an increase in the number of Arab women going to work and earning academic degrees and certifications. There has been significant government investment, including a five-year 15 billion shekel ($4.3 million) plan, implemented in 2015, to improve education, employment opportunities and other infrastructure in Israel's Arab communities.
The appointment of a female ""qadi"" – a magistrate or judge on a sharia court – may be even more significant in the long run than those other social changes, says Israeli parliamentarian Esawi Frej, a Muslim and a member of the left-wing Meretz political party. That's because Arab society remains deeply traditional, and what religious leaders say carries a lot of weight, explains Frej, who sat on the parliamentary committee that nominated Khatib.
""There really is no such thing as a secular Muslim,"" he says. ""So for real change in Muslim society, you need the religious establishment to support it. So it is significant that you have religious law saying it's OK for women to be a sharia court judge. That means that gender equality can improve in other parts of life, as well.""
Although appointing a female judge is still seen by many as controversial, Islamic law does not ban it, Abd Al-Hakim Samara, Israel's Sharia Court of Appeals president, said at last spring's swearing-in ceremony for Khatib and three new male judges. Khatib was appointed ""out of a right, not out of kindness,"" Samara said at the ceremony.

Empowered Muslim Feminists
In recent years, female sharia judges have been appointed to other courts in the region, including in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority. For centuries, judges have been only men due to cultural and social norms, experts say.
The appointment of female qadis in Israel and elsewhere shows how Muslim feminists are finding empowerment through religion, and changing the social and cultural norms that have long held them back, says Engy Abdelkader, a Rutgers University professor of human rights law who has researched the history of female Islamic judges.

Over the years, religious leaders have claimed that women were not allowed to be judges. But a growing Islamic feminist movement and greater religious literacy have led to increasing awareness that Islam's sacred texts do not ban women from judgeships, and that historical documents refer to a few women judges in Islam's early days, Abdelkader says. The growing number of female judges is significant, both socially and in influencing legal outcomes, she adds.
""It signals that Muslim women are capable. They help challenge stereotypical depictions as well as sometimes internalized messages about proper roles for Muslim women. … Greater diversity on the bench contributes to more representative, insightful opinions and outcomes.""
Khatib also says that when it comes to emotional issues, such as divorce, she can use her perspective as a woman when presenting court orders.
""When I need to give hard advice, like to tell a divorced woman that she must let her children see their father, I think it feels different hearing it from me than from a man.""
For Khatib, born in an Arab village in Israel to parents who worked as farmers after completing only the eighth grade, the journey to this position was not easy. Nor was it guaranteed. After obtaining her law degree in England, Khatib was an attorney practicing with her husband in the northern Israeli city of Tamra, representing clients in both civil and religious court.

Support for her came from seemingly unlikely places. Khatib says it was former Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, now a member of the center-left Zionist Camp, who first sparked the idea of her becoming a qadi. A parliamentary committee led by the justice minister appoints judges to Israel's various religious courts, but they must also be confirmed by the administrators of the courts. Livni's calls for a female Islamic judge began in 2010 and current Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked continued the push for approving female sharia court judges.
Although a member of the right-wing Jewish Home party, Shaked has over the years voiced concerns for increased gender equality in Israel's Arab society, aspects of which remain very much patriarchal.
""This was a surprise coming from Shaked, but I decided to go for it,"" Khatib says. She spent the next nearly four years studying at night for the religious judge exam, although it still wasn't clear such an appointment would be allowed. She was one of four women who passed the exam earlier this year, and waited eagerly to see if any of them would be appointed to a judgeship.
""Until the minute it was announced we didn't know it would happen,"" Khatib says, who adds she was nervous whether any of the four women would be appointed.
While Khatib's appointment is seen as significant in a symbolic sense, many say that the lack of an option for civil marriage in Israel remains problematic. A survey in 2017 by the Israeli nonprofit group Hiddush indicates that 76 percent of Jewish Israelis and 43 percent of Arab Israelis support implementing civil marriage.
""This is where we find the entrenched institutional discrimination against women in Israel,"" says Halperin-Kaddari, the Bar-Ilan University law professor. ""All the religious courts in Israel are patriarchal and give power to men over women. One woman in one religious court is not enough.""

Thomas Monson served as the 16th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for almost 10 years. 
Mormon Church President Dies at 90

Thomas S. Monson, president of the Mormon church, died Tuesday night at his home in Salt Lake City of natural causes, the church announced. He was 90 years old. 
Before Monson became the 16th president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 2008, he served in leadership positions for more than 50 years. He was a church bishop at 22 and became the youngest church apostle in 1963 at age 36. He also served as the counselor for three church presidents before taking over the role himself, according to the church.

During Monson's presidency, the church said its membership grew from 13 million to over 16 million worldwide, and dozens of new temples were announced and dedicated. The number of Mormon missionaries also grew under the governing of Monson, as he lowered the age requirement for missionaries in October 2012. 
Monson will be remembered for emphasizing humanitarian work, according to The Associated Press. He preached to ""never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved,"" the church statement said. 
""When I look at his life, he was a member of the Church everyone could relate to and everyone could feel comfortable in his presence,"" said President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, second counselor in the First Presidency, the church's highest governing body. ""He's really the one who's concerned about the rescue of the one. He is one who walked through the world looking for opportunities where he could serve individuals.""
Monson also was known for his tough stances on same-sex marriage, the admittance of gay members to the church and the ordination of female priests, according to The New York Times. 
Monson was born in Salt Lake City on Aug. 21, 1927, and graduated cum laude from the University of Utah in 1948 with a degree in business management. He received his MBA from Brigham Young University. 
In addition to his work with the Mormon church, Monson was successful in the publishing and printing sector. He had a long career associated with the Deseret News and was president of the Printing Industry of Utah and a former member of the board of directors of Printing Industries of America. He was also appointed by President Ronald Reagan to serve on the President's Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives.
Monson was married in 1948. His wife, Frances J. Monson, died in 2013. The couple had three children, eight grandchildren and many great-grandchildren, according to the church statement.

THE RISE AND FALL OF ADAM AND EVE By Stephen Greenblatt 419 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
Stephen Greenblatt follows Adam and Eve through a long arc of Western history. He begins at the beginning, with paleoanthropology, then moves on to the Babylonian epics, which influenced the early chapters of Genesis, and on to a sketch of the life of St. Augustine. From there, he arrives at the Renaissance and its depictions of the first and perfect man and woman, then Milton, of course, the age of discovery and the rationalist rejection of Adamic creation, which was a rejection as well of the belief that, as St. Augustine said, “God willed to create all men out of one, in order that they might be held in their society not only by likeness of kind, but also by bond of kindred.” Europeans found that the great world teemed with people toward whom they felt little likeness and less kindred. Then Darwin emerged, upending everything all over again. And Greenblatt finally lands in his last pages at a fairly disheartening account of mating among the chimpanzees. This is the march of progress, tinged with melancholy, as always.
There is, however, a complicating factor here, having to do with the question of truth. Greenblatt, an English professor at Harvard University and author of the National Book Award-winning “The Swerve,” frames his inquiry in terms of truth or fiction. For him truth means plausibility, and by that measure the story of Adam and Eve is no more than a miracle of storytelling. But science tells us that Homo sapiens does indeed roughly share a single lineage, in some sense a common origin, just as ancient Genesis says it does. In the Hebrew Bible the word adam often means all humankind, mortals. Greenblatt never seems to consider why the myth might have felt so true to those who found their religious and humanist values affirmed by it — and their own deepest intuitions, which science has partly borne out. It is interesting that those who claim to defend the creation narrative from rationalist critiques ignore the fact that its deepest moral implications, a profound human bond and likeness, have been scientifically demonstrated.
Greenblatt writes that the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Flood were written in contradistinction to the Babylonian narratives they resemble, to assert and preserve Hebrew religious culture. The changes made are profound. In the “Enuma Elish,” the Mesopotamian origin story, warfare among the gods ends in penal servitude for the losing side. They weary of the drudgery, so, as an act of conciliation, humans are created to toil in their place. A goddess fashions them of clay, seven male and seven female, all nameless. Compare this to the solicitude the Lord shows his Adam and Eve, their freedom even to disobey and the absolute importance of their choice, dire as it is. The Genesis text grants the difficulties of human life and at the same time evokes an essential dignity, beauty and autonomy.
These ancient narratives, even in their differences, are part of a genre whose insight and power are no doubt beyond the full understanding of our modern minds. They generally agree that people came late into the world, and that the world had a beginning. Accustomed as we are to knowing these things, we forget that neither is obvious.
In any case, it is a tendentious reading of any ancient text that would apply modern standards of plausibility to myth. Flavius Josephus, in his “Antiquities of the Jews,” written in the first century A.D., says of the second of Genesis’s two creation narratives, “Moses, after the seventh day was over [that is, in the creation of Adam and Eve], begins to talk philosophically.” His 18th-century editor, William Whiston, notes that, according to Josephus, “Moses wrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the rest in plain words,” and therefore it is possible that Josephus understood the entire story of human creation “in some enigmatical, or allegorical or philosophical sense.” The first-century Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria made a straightforward translation for his Hellenized readers — in the creation of Eve, “Moses is describing nothing else on this occasion except the formation of the external sense, according to energy and according to reason.” These commentaries are late on the time scale, but they show just how differently meaning can be found in texts, and therefore how differently meaning can be invested in them. With all due respect to the Enlightenment, rationalist worry about who Cain’s wife could have been is naïve. Greenblatt respects his subject, and still he assumes that the rationalist reading offers up the true meaning of the story.
Greenblatt imposes this kind of reasoning on John Milton, no less. He writes that Milton “was convinced that everything had to spring from and return to the literal truth of the Bible’s words. In the absence of that truth, Milton’s Christian faith and all the positions he had taken on the basis of that faith would be robbed of their meaning.” There is a special problem with the phrase “literal truth.” Milton knew Hebrew. A serious student of Scripture is aware that neither English nor Latin versions can be described as “literal.” When Milton’s devils can sing so beautifully that their listeners forget they are in hell, when the devil Belial rejects extinction, “for who would lose, / Though full of pain, this intellectual being, / Those thoughts that wander through eternity,” the poet may have in mind the Hebrew merism “good and bad,” which encompasses both and all that lies between, complicating the stark English binary “good and evil.” In any case, precisely his devotion to Scripture would have made his understanding of it nuanced and rich, and not in the least “literal.”
Milton was a major figure in the English Reformation. Scholars without a specialty in religious history are understandably reluctant to immerse themselves in all the varieties and phases of Christianity, so the pious are often all assumed to be “orthodox,” as Greenblatt frequently refers to them. But Milton was among the robust and diverse part of the English population called “dissenters” or “nonconformists.” He insisted on the sanctity of the individual’s response to Scripture, a freedom of conscience that could never legitimately be coerced, or conformed to any orthodoxy, even willingly. Milton says it is “a general maxim of the Protestant religion” that “he who holds in religion that belief or those opinions which to his conscience and utmost understanding appear with most evidence or probability in the Scripture, though to others he seem erroneous, can no more be justly censured for a heretic than his censurers.”
An awareness of the religious movement that Milton identified with and championed would have also helped Greenblatt in his parsing of the poet’s views on marriage. Rather than being based in hierarchy and submission, dissenters idealized marriage differently, interpreting the creation of Eve in terms like these: “Something was taken from Adam, in order that he might embrace, with greater benevolence, a part of himself. He lost, therefore, one of his ribs; but, instead of it, a far richer reward was granted him, since he obtained a faithful associate of life; for he now saw himself, who had before been imperfect, rendered complete in his wife.” This is John Calvin, one of the most widely read theologians in England during Milton’s lifetime and highly influential among those Milton calls Protestants.
“The Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve” is an ambitious attempt at an important cultural history. It is cursory, and, to the degree that its treatment of these influential texts and movements is uninformed, it is not a help in understanding them.
Marilynne Robinson is the author of four novels, including “Gilead,” which won the Pulitzer Prize. Her essay collection “The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought” was published in 1998.

JAKARTA, Indonesia — On a tree-lined side street in the Indonesian capital sits a colonial-era Protestant church with rustic wooden pews and stained-glass windows, and an antique pipe organ built into a large wall behind the altar.
Across the street is a modern, 100,000-square-foot mosque with towering arches at its entrances and a cavernous prayer area laid wall-to-wall with red carpet.
Despite their different faiths, the two houses of worship are friendly, helpful neighbors — and an example of pluralism in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation at a time of heightened fears over religious intolerance.
“We respect each other,” said Nur Alam, an imam at the Sunda Kelapa Grand Mosque, which opened in 1971. “If we never offend other people, then we will be respected.”
Across the street, Adriaan Pitoy is a pastor at St. Paul’s Church, which was built in 1936 under the Dutch colonial administration. “Our relationship is just one of many steps we take,” he said of the neighbors at the mosque. “We also go to other mosques to promote dialogue. Our relationship with our friends next door is normal.”

For the two houses of worship, normal means sharing parking spaces during busier services: Friday Prayer for the mosque, Sunday service for the church. They also host interfaith dialogue sessions, and even volleyball tournaments. During Ramadan, the Muslim holy fasting month, the staff at St. Paul’s, some of whom are Muslim, carry boxes of food to the mosque for worshipers there to break their fast.
Advertisement
This type of religious harmony among neighboring houses of worship is evident not just in Jakarta, but across the Indonesian archipelago. About 90 percent of Indonesia’s 260 million people are identified as Muslim, but the country also has small but influential Christian, Hindu, Buddhist and Confucian populations.
Yet these friendly relations are regularly overshadowed by international news reports and social media posts about racial intolerance and fears of the “Islamization” of Indonesia.
In recent years, there have been hundreds of cases of hard-line Islamic groups harassing, attacking and in some cases even killing religious minorities including Christians, Shiite Muslims and members of the Ahmadiyah Islamic sect, and forcibly closing hundreds of churches and other houses of worship across the country.
Then there is Indonesia’s domestic terrorism, dating back to 2000, including multiple bombings and attacks in Jakarta and the resort island of Bali by terrorist cells that pledged loyalty to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.
“If you see the actions of these hard-line groups, and threats from ISIS, or Indonesian militants coming back from Syria, they are a threat to interfaith cooperation in Indonesia,” said Theophilus Bela, former president of the Jakarta Christian Communication Forum, who has for years documented attacks on, and discriminatory actions against, churches in Indonesia.
A recent local challenge to religious harmony can be found cater-cornered from St. Paul’s Church and the Sunda Kelapa Grand Mosque, where, across a boulevard and public park, lies the official residence of the governor of Jakarta.
Basuki Tjahaja Purnama was supposed to be living there. Instead, he is in prison, serving a two-year sentence for blaspheming Islam in a case that ignited violent street marches through Jakarta by hard-line Islamist groups. They demanded he be prosecuted or lynched outright for citing a verse of the Quran that warns Muslims against taking Christians and Jews as allies.

Mr. Basuki, a Christian, subsequently suffered a landslide loss in a runoff election in April. A few weeks later, he was convicted by a Jakarta court and immediately transferred to a high-security prison, to the cheers and celebrations of hard-line Islamic groups gathered outside the courthouse.

Mr. Basuki’s prosecution and imprisonment shocked much of the country, in particular its religious minority communities.
Despite the case and its stoking of Muslim-Christian tensions, both Mr. Nur and Mr. Pitoy contend that the episode of Mr. Basuki was more political than religious, and they say they are not worried about the long-term durability of Indonesia’s pluralistic tradition.
“The people of Indonesia know that there have been conflicts among religious groups, but actually it’s not really just because of religious faith, but maybe it’s political, economic and things like that,” Mr. Pitoy said. “Sometimes it’s difficult to differentiate between politics and religion — especially in Indonesia.”
In August, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a human rights organization founded in Britain, released a report saying that Indonesia’s centuries-old tradition of religious pluralism was “under severe threat,” and that its reputation as a moderate, democratic Muslim-majority nation that protects freedom of religion was being undermined.
The report said some Christian communities particularly feared for their safety.
“There’s almost a sense that they are second-class citizens in their own country,” said Benedict Rogers, the organization’s East Asia team leader.
In response to the fall of Mr. Basuki, who used to attend St. Paul’s, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, one of his key political allies, established a special task force to reinforce the country’s state ideology, known as Pancasila, which enshrines pluralism.
Despite Mr. Basuki’s case, violent attacks on religious minorities have decreased substantially in the past five years. The Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace, a nongovernmental organization in Jakarta, had recorded only 93 such attacks this year through August, compared with 264 in all of 2012.

“But the number of blasphemy cases because of social media, because people have comments on Facebook and groups report them to the police, that is growing now,” said Bonar Tigor Naipospos, vice chairman of the Setara Institute’s executive board.
Mr. Nur and Mr. Pitoy both said Indonesia’s core problem with religion is not intolerance, but a lack of education and understanding among its people. Less than half of all Indonesians have completed primary school, according to the government’s statistical bureau.
“Indonesia is Muslim-majority — you have to accept it — but the lower class has a very simple knowledge” of Islam, Mr. Nur said. “That is why, if you want to know about the essence of Islam, which is peace and tolerance, study the Quran.”
When asked if he thought that religious intolerance was growing in Indonesia, Mr. Pitoy, the pastor at St. Paul’s, said, “I don’t think so.”
“The problems are about poverty and making social justice a reality,” he said of the challenges facing the church. “Also, with globalization, there are failures internally, and it has created many sudden changes. It’s very important to have a common foundation, and we have it with our Constitution and Pancasila.”

SEPT. 15, 2017

Pastor Twanna Gause stepped out of a limousine amid the whir of cameras outside the New Vision Full Gospel Baptist Church in East Orange, N.J.
Dressed in an off-white wedding gown and veil that sparkled in the cascading sunshine, she carried a bouquet of white roses and lilies, hugged several guests, then parted a sea of well-wishers on the way to her best friend, Pastor Vanessa Brown, who stood waiting at the altar in a cream-colored long coat called a sherwani and gold Punjabi jutti shoes.
The church doors opened, allowing the faint strains of “You Are So Beautiful” to float on the hot August air. Pastor Gause stepped inside, where she was greeted by Bishops Levi Richards and Eugene Gathers, both of the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries.
“She’s our spiritual daughter,” Bishop Richards said.
Both men walked Ms. Gause down the aisle, a role she had initially hoped would be accepted by her father, the Rev. Sam Gause Sr., a Pentecostal minister who lives in Atlanta.

But Mr. Gause, citing “differences in theological beliefs,” refused his daughter’s invitation.
“My father would not come here because he does not believe in same-sex marriage,” Ms. Gause said. “He told me the devil tricked me into this, and that if we had been married in biblical times, we would have been stoned to death.”

Mr. Gause, who helped raise four other daughters and a son before divorcing their mother, Cathy Dodson, in 1996, held steadfast in his decision.
“Twanna very well knows I’m not for that kind of lifestyle,” he said by phone in a calm and stern tone several days after the wedding.
“I believe that God wanted us to procreate through a natural process, and by no means am I happy about this because it is unnatural,” he said. “I look at homosexuality as a mental disorder. If I start to tell you that I am an elephant, and start to behave as an elephant, that’s my choice, I choose to become an elephant. But you would probably choose to call a mental institution.”
Mr. Gause, long affiliated with the Center of Hope Church of God in Christ in Riverdale, Ga., said he had no immediate plans to contact his daughter.
“I will talk to her at some point, I suppose, if she calls me, but I will not initiate the call,” he said. “I do have some words for her that she needs to hear. I’m not going to condemn her or judge her because I don’t have that authority, but judgment has already been established by God.”
Ms. Brown, 46, and Ms. Gause, 45, both pastors of Rivers of Living Water United Church of Christ, which has locations in Newark and New York, heard much softer words on their wedding day while holding hands before the Rev. Dr. Yvette Flunder, the presiding bishop of the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, who read from the First Epistle to the Corinthians.
“Love is patient, love is kind. ... Love hopes and endures all things,” Bishop Flunder read, as amens and hallelujahs rang out from some the 200-plus guests who flocked to celebrate a love that has endured for nearly three decades.

“Twanna and I go way, way back,” Ms. Brown said.
Once upon an Amazing Grace, two choir girls met at a church in Jersey City, and before one of them could clear her throat to sing, she thought she had already caught a glimpse of heaven.
“I was like, ‘Oh wow, what in the world, who’s that, she’s beautiful,’” recalled Ms. Gause, who was then a 16-year-old living in Paterson, N.J. “I immediately felt this kind of strange, warm feeling wash over me, and though I had not yet spoken a word to her, I could see myself loving this woman forever. My head was just spinning.”
Ms. Brown, then 18 and living in New York, was not struck by the same thunderbolt.
“I was oblivious as to how Twanna was feeling,” Ms. Brown said. “I looked at her as this adorable, skinny little girl who I initially thought was so much younger than me, and I had no idea that she liked me in any way other than as a friend.”
Ms. Gause, who said she was hoping for a connection, was crushed. “Though it broke my heart, I never said a word about my true feelings for Vanessa because I didn’t want it to hurt our friendship,” she said. “And I never said a word to my father because he was so strict, I knew he wouldn’t understand.”
Both grew up in religious families — “We didn’t hang on street corners, go to clubs or do drugs, none of that,” Ms. Gause said. But they spent time together at events sponsored by the Hiya Fellowship of the Saviour Church in Jersey City and at LaGree Baptist Church in Harlem, which were linked through a minister who served both congregations.
Their friendship continued to blossom until the day in 1990 when Ms. Gause called Ms. Brown to say that her father was moving the family to Atlanta.
“I was devastated,” Ms. Brown said. “Twanna had become my best friend in the whole world, I didn’t know what I would do without her.”
They kept in touch, and Ms. Gause moved back to Paterson in 1994, and became engaged to a man there, breaking it off in less than a year and returning to Atlanta, where she toured with a gospel choir and worked as a cosmetologist.

“That relationship just didn’t seem right,” Ms. Gause said. “Plus I still had Vanessa on my mind.”

But Ms. Brown, who was by then working as a producer and talent coordinator for “Amateur Night” at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, had married a man in 2004.
“Even though I was still in love with Vanessa, I never told her it should have been me,” said Ms. Gause, who did not attend the wedding. “But I knew for sure it shouldn’t have been him.”
Time, and not much of it, proved Ms. Gause right. By May 2005, five months after it began, Ms. Brown’s first marriage was over. “I should have listened to Twanna,” she said.
Later that year, Ms. Brown invited Ms. Gause to give a guest sermon at Oasis of Love, a church in Harlem where she served as an associate pastor.
“We went to dinner and started catching up and talking about our lives,” Ms. Brown said. “Twanna seemed so much more mature than I remembered her, and she was very sound in her preaching.”
For the first time, Ms. Gause began to express her true feelings, and Ms. Brown began seeing her old friend through “a different set of eyes,” as she put it.
After dinner, they strolled through Ms. Brown’s Harlem neighborhood until they came to the brownstone where she lived. They walked up a short flight of stairs, and Ms. Brown reached for a key to open the front door. As she attempted to turn the lock, her hand was suddenly covered by Ms. Gause’s. Ms. Brown turned to find Ms. Gause gazing at her. No words were spoken, though each knew what was coming next.

“She had waited a long time to kiss me, and I knew this was it,” Ms. Brown said. “I was so nervous. My heart started racing.”
For Ms. Gause, it was heaven-sent, and nearly 30 years in the making. “It was a wonderful, wonderful kiss,” she said. “Well worth the wait.”
They began dating long distance, and during a visit to Atlanta in 2006, Ms. Gause introduced Ms. Brown to her father. She told him she was a friend with no elaboration.
“I wasn’t quite ready to tell him,” she said.
Two years later, Ms. Gause was ready. She and Ms. Brown, in Atlanta to attend a religious conference, arranged a family meeting at the home of Ms. Gause’s mother, who also lives in Atlanta, to tell them that they were together.
“My father didn’t take it too well,” Ms. Gause said.
Indeed, they were still in Atlanta two days later, when Mr. Gause, carrying a large King James Version of the Bible, confronted them in the lobby of the hotel where the conference was being held.
“He slammed the Bible down on a table and said to us, ‘Did you all read this book?’” Ms. Gause said. “He was furious.”
During his recent phone conversation, Mr. Gause said he had actually stormed the hotel “to confront their pastor over theological beliefs, but he never showed.”
Mr. Gause also made it clear that the passing of time has not healed any wounds.
“We all have a conscience,” he said. “It is through that conscience that we hear from our creator as to what is right and what is wrong, and if God did not want us to procreate, then why didn’t he just create billions of people with no gender at all? He must have had a reason for doing what he did.”

Mr. Gause, who owned a company in Atlanta that made signs, said: “It was a mistake that her mother even went to the wedding. Had she rejected outright that kind of behavior, and become the lovable person that my daughter was in search of, perhaps Twanna would have had a different idea about that kind of thing, and not gone elsewhere to seek love.”
When asked about Mr. Gause’s absence at the wedding reception, an elegant affair at il Tulipano in Cedar Grove, N.J., Bishop Richards said simply: “God has a way of honoring us when others won’t.”
Ms. Dodson, who spent most of the evening chatting with Ms. Brown’s mother, Mary Ellen Brown, did not mince words when talking about her ex-husband’s refusal to attend.
“He has no right to judge them,” she said. “I tried to get him to come here tonight but it was a losing battle. He asked me why I would even bother showing up, and I said to him, ‘All you need to remember is that Twanna is my daughter, and I love her, and I have her back no matter what she does, and that’s why I’ll be there.’”
Ms. Brown, who graduated from New York Theological Seminary in May, and Ms. Gause, who graduated from Essex County Community College with an associate’s degree in social science and is now studying for a bachelor’s in social work at Rutgers, are moving forward with their lives, “with or without my father’s blessings,” Ms. Gause said.
“Don’t get me wrong, I still love him,” she said. “I still call him on birthdays and holidays and special occasions, though he never picks up the phone.”
“Maybe one day he will realize that nothing has really changed with me except for the fact that I've found my perfect soul mate, and he’ll feel like talking to me again,” she said. “But no matter what my daddy says about me or what he thinks of me, he knows down deep, deep inside that I’ll always be his little girl.”

A season of religious holidays around the world moves into higher gear on Wednesday with the observance of one of the most important saints in the Orthodox Church, a person whose gift-giving legacy is partially tied to the birth of the Santa Claus legend in the U.S. and Father Christmas in the U.K.
But with the arrival of St. Nicholas Day – observed on Dec. 6 in Western Christian nations but on different December days elsewhere – also come questions about the future place Orthodoxy will occupy in the larger Christian world, say analysts.

Orthodox Christians exist in greater numbers today than in the past, yet represent a diminished share of Christians worldwide. Confined primarily to an aging Europe and strongly tethered to tradition, Orthodox Christianity may need to change its ways to remain relevant, say some practitioners.
""People are sending out a signal that they don't identify with structures of the past anymore and look for new forms of spirituality,"" says the Rev. Cosmin Antonescu from the Saint Andrew Romanian Orthodox Church in Potomac, Maryland.
Around 260 million people in the world today identify themselves as Christian Orthodox, double the number registered a century ago, according to a report from the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Russia alone has more than 100 million followers, while more than 95 percent of people in predominantly Orthodox countries such as Moldova, Georgia, Romania and Greece report keeping icons at home.
Yet, as popular as Orthodoxy is in Eastern Europe, this branch or Christianity seems to be losing ground in the overall Christian population. Today, Orthodox Christians represent only 4 percent of the world’s population. Additionally, Orthodox followers account for 12 percent of Christians worldwide, down 8 percentage points from the levels in 1910, according to the Pew report. 
The reasons for this decline are many, and experts say they have to do with history and a more rigid administrative structure of the overall Orthodox community.
After the East-West Schism of 1054 between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, Orthodoxism was left isolated in a declining Byzantine Empire. As countries broke away from the empire, Orthodoxism developed in a more decentralized way. “All nations identifying themselves as Orthodox have their own independent ruling,” Antonescu says.
While the Orthodox and the Catholic churches share many rituals and religious beliefs, experts say Orthodoxism seems to have done a better job at keeping its original traditions. When Catholics tried adapting the church to respond to new social needs, the Orthodox Christians focused on preserving their customs. 
“We were the most constant church in Christianity, but failing to respond to people’s ever-changing needs made us lose ground in society,” Antonescu says.
Today, Orthodoxism remains concentrated in Europe, where 77 percent of Orthodox Christians still live, while Roman Catholicism expanded around the world.
“In the beginning we were the Byzantine Empire,"" Antonescu says. ""Catholicism, the Western culture expanded in the world and brought Christianity to many places, while, after the rise of Islam, the Byzantine Empire focused on mainly defending against Islamic attacks until the fall of Constantinople. We weren’t given the same space as the Catholics were.”

Catholics have also arguably benefited from a stronger public presence by being represented by a singular leader, the pope, who has often been a well-known contemporary figure.
“Pope John Paul I became a significant global figure in his relatively short time; John Paul II was clearly a very visible figure globally, as well as Pope Francis is today,” says the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky of the Church of Our Lady of Kazan, a Russian Orthodox Church in Sea Cliff, New York. “This all stems from the specifics of the Catholic Church with a figure in the bishop of Rome. This focus is very real and has been there all along but in the age of media popularity it has become very effective.” 
According to the Pew report, a decline in Orthodoxism might also stem from declining demographic trends, with a lower fertility rate in Europe, where populations are growing older. 
“Europe’s population has long been shrinking as a share of the world’s total population, and, in coming decades, it is projected to decline in absolute numbers as well,” the report shows.
In order to preserve not only its traditions but also its existence, experts say the Orthodox Church will need to look beyond Europe. That will be a challenging task, since the Orthodox Church is competing with more active religions that seem to be able to expand faster. 
“Christianity is growing primarily in Africa and Asia and the Orthodox are not strong enough in those parts of the world to keep up with the demographic challenge of growth,” Kishkovsky says. “There is also a huge growth of Christians in China for instance. But the Chinese social and political situation is such that the primary growth – millions of adherents to Christianity – comes to the Protestants because their missions can be very informal and they move quickly among parts of the populations.”
Whether Orthodox traditions will stand the test of time is unknown. Priests say it's not uncommon for religions to transform and mold into something new, a development that shouldn't worry Orthodox followers.
""Theology evolves as well as the process of knowing God,"" Antonescu says. ""Some spiritualities never die but turn into something else that respond to the same human needs but maybe in a different way.""

Christianity is expected to remain the most common religion at the time of death, but a new study suggests global religious trends will see some shifts by the year 2060. (Getty Images)
The future of the world's religious landscape is shifting as people age.
New global findings published in the Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, a peer-reviewed academic journal, suggest the worldwide pattern of religious affiliation at a person's time of death is on track to noticeably change by 2060. Researchers suggest such changes could affect global trends in end-of-life health care and burial practices.
""Religious affiliation affects which end-of-life practices are preferred, whether specific life-extending procedures are acceptable, and whether specific post-mortem practices, such as cremation, will be carried out,"" said lead author Vegard Skirbekk, in a statement.

Skirbekk and a team of researchers from the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health analyzed data from more than 2,500 surveys, registries and censuses across 198 nations to project beliefs and the number of deaths by age, sex and religion between the years 2010 and 2060. Their projections covered eight major religious groups: Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, folk religions, other religions and the unaffiliated.
The study found that people still most commonly identify as Christian at their time of death, but that Christianity's share of global deaths is expected to fall from 37 percent in 2010 to 31 percent by 2060. The share of people who will die in 2060 who identify as Muslim will in turn increase from 21 percent to 25 percent during that time. The percent of religiously unaffiliated worldwide is projected to peak at 17 percent in 2035 followed by a slight decline.
Regionally, researchers note that Muslims are expected to become the most common religious group in Nigeria, while in South Korea, the share of people who identify as Christian will be larger than the share who say they are Buddhist. Europe is expected to grow increasingly secularized. Researchers projected that the religiously unaffiliated in the region will increase from 14 percent to 21 percent of deaths.

North America is also expected to see an increase among people who don't identify with a particular religion. The study found that the religiously unaffiliated will double from now until 2060 to account for 20 percent of all deaths. 
North Americans who identify as Muslim are projected to increase from 0.4 percent to 1.6 percent by 2060, and the study suggests that the share of Christians will fall at the time of death, moving from 85 percent between 2010 and 2015 to just 74 percent between 2055 and 2060. 
Researchers say the distinct regional patterns have the potential to eventually shape funeral rites, affect health practices and alter the traditions and social customs related to death and dying around the globe.

John Bolton is a raging Islamophobe, and on April 9, he’s set to become President Donald Trump’s national security adviser.
Trump announced Thursday, to the alarm of foreign policy experts around the world, that Bolton would replace H.R. McMaster in the position. Bolton, who served under President George W. Bush in the State Department and as ambassador to the United Nations, is best known for his support of the Iraq War, in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed.
A less well-known but equally troubling aspect of Bolton’s career is his years of involvement with some of the most hateful and conspiratorial elements of the anti-Muslim movement in America.
“We urge Americans across the political spectrum to speak out against the appointment of John Bolton as White House National Security Adviser because of his ties to anti-Muslim bigots and his promotion of extremist views that will inevitably harm our nation and that could lead to unnecessary and counterproductive international conflicts,” Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement Thursday.
“Bolton is the last person who should be entrusted with this critically-important position, which requires sound judgment and a fact-based approach to national security matters,” Awad said.
Bolton did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Since 2013, Bolton has served as chairman of the Gatestone Institute, an anti-Muslim think tank. Under his leadership, Gatestone has published fearmongering articles with headlines like “Islam’s ‘Quiet Conquest’ of Europe” and “Refugees of an Occupation Army?” Other posts have depicted Muslim refugees as rapists and hosts of “highly infectious diseases.”
Gatestone has trafficked in paranoid and debunked conspiracy theories about American Muslims secretly working to undermine the U.S. government and implement Sharia, or Islamic law. The group has also been a proponent of the “no-go zone” myth, the false claim that certain neighborhoods in various European and American cities are off-limits to non-Muslims.
In 2016, Bolton was the keynote speaker at the annual conference of the far-right American Freedom Alliance. The title of that conference was “Islam and Western Civilization: Can They Coexist?” A few minutes into his speech, Bolton made a joke based on the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim.
The crowd, a who’s who of American Islamophobes, laughed and applauded.
Since leaving government work in 2006, Bolton has had a cozy relationship with some of America’s most virulent anti-Muslim activists, including Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer. He wrote the foreword for Geller and Spencer’s 2010 book, The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America. Bolton gave a full-throated endorsement of the book, which is replete with anti-Muslim tropes.
Since then, Bolton has been interviewed by Geller multiple times, and even offered a blurb for her latest book, Fatwa. “Free speech advocates who don’t make waves are not doing their jobs,” Bolton wrote. “Pamela Geller writes a guidebook here for Paladins of the First Amendment.”  
Geller and Spencer are founders of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has classified as a hate group, and which the Anti-Defamation League describes as “consistently vilifying the Islamic faith under the guise of fighting radical Islam.”
The SPLC describes Geller as “probably the best known — and the most unhinged — anti-Muslim ideologue in the United States.” She came to prominence for her fearmongering over a proposed Islamic community center in lower Manhattan, which she argued would be a “victory mosque” for Muslims on “conquered land.”
She has called Islam, the world’s second largest religion, “the most radical and extreme ideology on the face of the earth” and said it should be regarded as “an authoritarian and supremacist political system.”
Her online presence is devoted to spreading anti-Muslim and anti-refugee propaganda. A 2015 FBI intelligence bulletin referred to stories published by Geller as “unfounded” and amounting to nothing more than “conspiracy theories” responsible for fomenting fear of Muslims in the U.S.
Geller was very excited Thursday that Trump had tapped Bolton as national security adviser:
Excelsior! https://t.co/qlWYvut3UM
Robert Spencer has likewise made a career out of spreading fear and misinformation about Islam. From the SPLC:
Spencer has complained of ‘Shariah enclaves’ and predicted that they will grow across America; referred to Barack Obama as ‘the first Muslim president’; claimed that Islam ‘mandates warfare against unbelievers’ and said that ‘traditional Islam is not moderate or peaceful’; and even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light.
Bolton also contributed a blurb to Spencer’s 2008 book, Stealth Jihad.

Bolton isn’t the only admirer of Spencer and Geller’s work. In 2011, the far-right Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik killed 77 people who he believed were abetting what he saw as the “Islamization of Europe.” In a sprawling, racist manifesto, Breivik cited the work of Geller and Spencer 174 times.  
Bolton has also been a close associate of another prominent anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist: Frank Gaffney.
Gaffney is the founder of the Center for Security Policy, an anti-Muslim think tank that the SPLC considers a hate group. He’s done much to promote debunked “civilization jihad” and “creeping Sharia” conspiracy theories, which claim that American Muslims are plotting to somehow take over the U.S. government and replace the Constitution with a brutal version of Sharia.
Gaffney has claimed in the past that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated every level of the federal government. He once called for a “House of Anti-American Activities Committee” to root out these alleged subversives.
In 2015, Bolton spoke at multiple “National Security Action Summits” organized by Gaffney’s Center for Security Policy. In 2006, Bolton accepted the CSP’s Freedom Flame Award.
Bolton has also appeared multiple times as a guest on Gaffney’s “Secure Freedom Radio” podcast ― most recently in July, when he agreed with Gaffney that the Muslim Brotherhood should be designated a terror group. (The idea of labeling the MB a terror group is widely frowned upon in foreign policy circles; national security experts believe such a designation would mainly serve to provide cover for prosecuting and harassing American Muslim civil rights groups.)
On Thursday, Gaffney seemed enthused about Bolton’s new career opportunity.
.@RealDonaldTrump has replaced an insubordinate National Security Advisor with a loyal, competent one: John Bolton. It’s a game-changer for his presidency and for our nation. Congratulations Mr. President! It truly is Morning in America. Let’s roll!
Trump, who’s declared that “Islam hates us,” has turned his White House into a haven for people with paranoid, hostile views toward the religion.
Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former CIA director and current secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo, former national security adviser Sebastian Gorka, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, and White House counsel Kellyanne Conway all have well-established ties to anti-Muslim hate groups.

Easter is a pivotal moment within the Christian liturgical calendar. It marks the end of Lent, a period of 40 days of penance, fasting and contemplation. On Easter, Christians commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, an event they believe precipitates God’s victory over death and sin.
Since medieval times, Christians have prepared for Easter by participating in passion plays, dramatic retellings of the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The plays often take viewers through the events of Holy Week. 
On Palm Sunday, Christians believe Jesus was joyously welcomed into Jerusalem. Days later, on Holy Thursday, also called Maundy Thursday, the scriptures say he celebrated his last meal with his disciples and instituted the practice of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion. Good Friday marks the day Jesus was crucified and three days later, on Easter Sunday, Christians believe he was resurrected. 
Some Jewish organizations have criticized passion plays for perpetuating the false notion that Jewish people were responsible for the crucifixion. Since 1965, the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian denominations have taken steps to correct these problematic, anti-Semitic interpretations of the events of Holy Week.
This year, Easter falls on April 1 and Christians have already started performing in public passion plays to help retell the story of Jesus’ death and resurrection.

A Texas megachurch pastor stands accused of using his influence to lure “vulnerable and elderly” people into a financial scheme that caused some to lose their life savings.
Rev. Kirbyjon H. Caldwell, the pastor of Windsor Village United Methodist Church in Houston, is facing federal charges of defrauding investors out of more than $1 million using obsolete Chinese bonds. 
A federal grand jury has handed a 13-count indictment charging Caldwell and Gregory Alan Smith, a financial planner from Louisiana, U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook of the Western District of Louisiana said Thursday. The charges against the men, who allegedly conspired with each other, include wire fraud and money laundering.
Van Hook’s office claims Caldwell used his status as pastor of the Houston church to help gain investors’ trust. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is also suing Caldwell and Smith in federal court for allegedly violating financial laws. 
Dan Cogdell, an attorney for Caldwell, told HuffPost in a statement that the accusations against the pastor are “simply false.”
Cogdell said his client believed the bonds to be legitimate and had invested a significant amount of his own money into the scheme. He also said Caldwell “never used his status as a Reverend at all regarding the investments.” 
The SEC says that between April 2013 and August 2014, Caldwell and Smith allegedly convinced 29 people, many of them “vulnerable and elderly,” to invest more than $1 million in bonds issued by the former Republic of China.
These bonds are not recognized by China’s current government and have no value beyond being collectors’ items. But Smith and Caldwell reportedly promised their investors high rates of return, sometimes three to 15 times the value of the investments.
Smith was responsible for finding the investors, according to the SEC complaint. Caldwell would then instruct them to wire transfer money to an associate or to a company he and his wife controlled in Wyoming. 
“Instead of investing the funds, the defendants used them to pay personal loans, credit card balances, mortgages, vehicle purchases and other personal expenses,” Van Hook’s office said. 
Throughout 2014, Caldwell and Smith reportedly sent emails and texts to investors promising them they would be paid. The SEC states that these “lulling emails” provided “elaborate” explanations about why the investors had yet to see returns. Caldwell also reportedly used “religious references” to give investors hope that they would be repaid, repeatedly telling them to “remain faithful.”
Many of the investors were allegedly “unsophisticated retirees” who followed Smith’s advice to liquidate their annuities to invest in the scheme. The SEC says none of the investors received any return on their investments, and that the majority never made back their principal investment.
“Although many investors did not understand the investment, they ultimately trusted Smith and took comfort in the fact that a high-profile pastor was offering the investment,” the SEC complaint reads. 
Cogdell claimed his client refunded unsatisfied investors with his own money. 
Caldwell has been a prominent religious figure in Texas and the U.S. for many years. 
Caldwell has led Windsor Village Church since 1982, helping the congregation grow from 25 members to more than 16,000, according to the church’s website. 
He also served as a spiritual adviser to President George W. Bush, and officiated the wedding for his daughter Jenna in 2008. Caldwell went on to be one of President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers, publicly endorsing the candidate in 2008 and reportedly donating to his political campaign.
Before becoming a United Methodist Church pastor, Caldwell was an investment banker and bond broker, The Washington Post reports. He also wrote a book in 1999 called The Gospel of Good Success: A Road Map to Spiritual, Emotional and Financial Wholeness, in which he said God wants Christians to be successful in all aspects of their lives, including their finances. 
Don Thomas, media director at The Window Village Church, told HuffPost on Friday evening that Caldwell never advertised the bonds at church events. Thomas said he does not expect Caldwell to take a leave or be fired from the church during the course of the investigation.
“The church community is very supportive and affirming during this time,” Thomas wrote in an email.
A spokesman for the Texas Annual Conference of the UMC told HuffPost on Friday afternoon that Caldwell remained a pastor there. 
“The United Methodist Church has high standards for the moral conduct of its clergy, and we recognize the seriousness of the charges against him,” wrote Scott J. Jones, the conference’s bishop. “We will walk through this difficult situation with Rev. Caldwell and the Windsor Village congregation and keep them in our prayers. We have faith that the judicial process will find the truth.”
Caldwell plans to preach at Windsor Village Church this weekend, reports local news outlet KTRK, citing Cogdell. 
The attorney said the pastor will surrender to authorities in Louisiana “in the next week or so.” He said he expects Caldwell to be released on bail pending trial.
Caldwell and Smith each face 20 years in prison for the wire fraud charges, and 10 years for the money laundering charges. They also each face a $1 million fine.

A leading figure in America’s largest Protestant denomination has resigned from his job over a “morally inappropriate relationship in the recent past.”
Frank Page, who served as the president and chief executive of the Southern Baptist Convention’s executive committee, announced his retirement on Monday. A day later, he followed up with a statement explaining that he was stepping away from active ministry because of a “personal failing” that has “embarrassed my family, my Lord, myself, and the Kingdom.”
“Out of a desire to protect my family and those I have hurt, I initially announced my retirement earlier today without a complete explanation,” the pastor said in a statement released to Baptist Press on Tuesday. “However, after further wrestling with my personal indiscretion, it became apparent to me that this situation must be acknowledged in a more forthright manner.”
Page, 65, added that he’s seeking to rebuild his relationship with his wife and two daughters. 
No further details have been reported about the nature of the relationship, or who the other party was. The SBC did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Page served as president of the SBC from 2006 to 2008. He was elected as president of the denomination’s executive committee in 2010, and was tasked with overseeing a budget of nearly $200 million, according to The Associated Press.
The executive committee is an administrative body that coordinates the national ministries of the SBC and handles its financial affairs. The SBC consists of a network of more than 47,000 independently operating Baptist churches, with a total membership of more than 15 million people.
Stephen Rummage, the executive committee’s current chairman, said Page has expressed “deep regret” about how his actions have caused pain for others.
Rummage said the executive committee recognized that it needed to share the news about Page’s resignation with the “watching world” and other Southern Baptists “with truth and candor.”
“My heart is broken for Dr. Page, his family and everyone affected,” Rummage said in a statement. “I believe I speak for the entire Executive Committee in saying that we are committed to provide them the spiritual and emotional support they need in the coming days.”", religion

The Vatican’s media chief has resigned amid a scandal over a digitally manipulated photograph that misrepresented a letter from retired Pope Benedict XVI.
Pope Francis accepted Monsignor Dario Vigano’s resignation over what’s been dubbed the “lettergate” scandal on Wednesday, The Associated Press reports. The pope nominated the Italian priest’s deputy, Monsignor Lucio Adrian Ruiz, to take over the Vatican communications department.
The resignation followed the Vatican’s admission last week that it digitally altered a photograph of a Feb. 7 letter written Benedict commenting on a new 11-volume book series about Pope Francis’ theology. Vigano had asked Benedict to write a review of the series. The photo was released by the Vatican communications department on March 12, one day before the five-year anniversary of Pope Francis’ election. 
Vigano reportedly read parts of the letter at a news conference about the book series, and used it to repudiate conservative critics of Pope Francis, who say the pope’s style is a stark departure from that of his predecessor, according to the AP.
Vigano cited a portion of the letter in which Benedict writes that the books show the “interior continuity between the two pontificates, with all the differences in style and temperament.” But he failed to read the letter’s harsh criticism of one of the volume’s authors for “anti-papist” views about Benedict and his predecessor, St. John Paul II. 
Benedict’s letter also admits he didn’t have time to read the entire book series, and can’t offer a sound theological review of the project.
The Vatican photograph of the letter, however, blurs the portion where the retired pope begins to explain this.
Most major news media have strict policies that prohibit editors from digitally adding or subtracting from photographs, especially when it alters the meaning of the image.
“Benedict’s full caveat about his refusal to comment on the volume was never made public in Vigano’s presentation, press release or accompanying photo,” the AP writes. “That omission left the impression that the 91-year-old retired pope had read the volume and fully endorsed it, when in fact he hadn’t.”
On Saturday, the Vatican bowed to pressure from the media and from Catholic conservatives to release Benedict’s complete letter. The Secretariat for Communications said it initially withheld part of the letter because of a desire for reserve ― “not because of any desire to censor.” 
Vigano referred to the controversy in his resignation letter dated March 19, according to the Vatican News. He said he was stepping aside out of respect for co-workers, and didn’t want to “delay, damage or block” Francis’ reform of Vatican communications operations.
The scandal comes just weeks after Francis condemned the spread of fake news. Francis released a message in January that compared fake news with the “evil” that destroyed the Biblical figures Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. He identified fake news as “false information based on non-existent or distorted data meant to deceive and manipulate the reader.”
The pope wrote that “spreading fake news can serve to advance specific goals, influence political decisions, and serve economic interests.” He added that it was the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.
“Ensuring the accuracy of sources and protecting communication are real means of promoting goodness, generating trust, and opening the way to communion and peace,” Francis wrote.", religion

In the heart of an affluent Philadelphia suburb lies a palatial, 73-acre estate that was once the epicenter of a fast-growing religion said to have thousands of believers who thought of their leader as god on earth. This was ― and still is ―“Father’s Kingdom,” and a new documentary tells this amazing though largely forgotten story. 
Currently on the festival circuit, the documentary explores the International Peace Mission, a movement that reached heights in the 1930s and slowly began to dwindle after the 1965 death of its controversial founder, “Father Divine” ― a man who called himself god. 
“It was like being in another world,” said the film’s director Lenny Feinberg, whose other work includes documentaries like “The Art of the Steal,” “Black and White” and “Dead All Over.”
“[The Mission] lives in a very secluded, isolated venue and they have no focus other than being a follower of Father Divine. Just learning about his impact was amazing,” he said.
Father Divine was also an advocate for anti-lynching laws and desegregation, using both of these campaigns to influence the Mission’s core beliefs. He had both black and white supporters and often held rallies that inspired his followers to take part in the civil rights movement.
Researchers believe Father Divine’s given name was George Baker, but he refuted the name as blasphemous hearsay, saying infamously that “God has no mother” and therefore has no origin. No one has verified Father Divine’s real name. In a major victory for the movement, in 1973, eight years after Father’s passing, the Peace Mission requested the Library of Congress remove the name “George Baker” from its records altogether. 
“[Father] was empowering people in their lives in a way that some people, of course, are afraid of, you know, because of the enormous pull of a religion like this in terms of attracting people and keeping them,” said Dr. Leonard Primiano, a professor of religious studies at Philadelphia’s Cabrini University. 
The voices of Father’s longtime followers ― many of whom still live on the Philadelphia estate in the Main Line ― drive the narrative in “Father’s Kingdom.” Now advancing in age, they tell the complicated history of the mission and explain their sometimes controversial beliefs. 
In a broad sense, they can be categorized as a communal religion based on Christian ideology. Like some Christian churches, they forbid alcohol and drugs, promote modesty laws and practice celibacy. 
But they also heavily differ from the Christian norm. They prefer to say “peace” instead of “hello” because the latter has the word “hell” in it. Father also required followers to cut ties with their families because, as stated in Matthew 16:24, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.”
And unlike other Christian sects, the Mission doesn’t believe in heaven. Instead, as follower Dr. Christopher Stewart said, heaven is something here on Earth.
“The kingdom is a tangible thing and the followers have taken that so seriously and have really manifested extraordinary things,” he said in an interview with HuffPost.
The documentary, in its examination of the mission’s history, follows the history of a man and mission who fought against segregation, fed and empowered the poor and believed that God was here on Earth. Through this film the movement’s impact is tangible.
“Father’s Kingdom” has been scheduled at multiple festivals including: The Cleveland International Film Festival, The Salem Film Fest, The Charlotte Black Film Festival, Big Sky Film Festival in Montana, and Doc NYC.", religion

VATICAN CITY, March 25 (Reuters) - Pope Francis, starting Holy Week services leading to Easter, urged young people on Sunday to keep shouting and not allow the older generations to silence their voices or anesthetize their idealism.
Francis spoke a day after hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters answered a call to action from survivors of last month’s Florida high school massacre and rallied across the United States to demand tighter gun laws. He did not mention the demonstrations.
Dear young people, never get tired of being instruments of peace and joy among your peers!
Catholic News Service (CNS) said Gabriella Zuniga, 16, and her sister Valentina, 15, both students from Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, where 17 people were killed in February, attended the service with their parents.
CNS posted a photo of the two holding up signs in St. Peter’s Square, with one reading, “Protect Our Children, Not Our Guns.”
The 81-year-old Francis led a long and solemn Palm Sunday service before tens of thousands in the square, many of them young people there for the Catholic Church’s World Day of Youth.
Carrying a woven palm branch known as a “palmurello,” Francis led a procession in front of the largest church in Christendom to commemorate the day the Bible says Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed as a savior, only to be crucified five days later.

Drawing on biblical parallels, Francis urged the young people in the crowd not to let themselves be manipulated.
“The temptation to silence young people has always existed,” Francis said in the homily of a Mass.
“There are many ways to silence young people and make them invisible. Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing. There are many ways to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive,” he said.
“Dear young people, you have it in you to shout,” he told young people, urging them to be like the people who welcomed Jesus with palms rather than those who shouted for his crucifixion only days later.
“It is up to you not to keep quiet. Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, some corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?”
The young people in the crowd shouted, “Yes!”
While Francis did not mention Saturday’s marches in the United States, he has often condemned weapons manufacturing and mass shootings.
Palm Sunday marked the start of a hectic week of activities for the pope.
On Holy Thursday he is due to preside at two services, including one in which he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a Rome jail to commemorate Jesus’ gesture of humility towards his apostles the night before he died.
On Good Friday, he is due to lead a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome’s Colosseum. On Saturday night he leads a Easter vigil service and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message.

Alabama’s voters will decide in November whether the Ten Commandments can be displayed on state property.
The state’s House of Representatives voted 66-19 on Thursday to advance a ballot provision that would amend Alabama’s constitution to allow the monuments. The state Senate has already approved the Republican proposal, which does not need the governor’s signature, The Associated Press reports.
The move comes 15 years after Roy Moore, then the chief justice of Alabama’s Supreme Court, lost his job for refusing to enforce a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments display from a state judicial building.
Under the proposed amendment, the Ten Commandments may be displayed on property belonging to public schools and in other state-owned buildings “in a manner that complies with constitutional requirements.” Those include placing the commandments alongside “historical or educational items” as part of a larger display.
The ballot proposal, submitted by state Sen. Gerald Dial (R), would prohibit the use of public funds to defend the measure’s constitutionality if it is challenged in court. Private money would fund the displays, the AP reports.
Dial has brought up similar measures for years, according to AL.com.
Ten Commandments displays in Alabama have provoked controversy in the past. In 2003, a federal judge ordered a 5,200-pound Ten Commandments monument removed from the lobby of the state judicial building in Montgomery. Moore refused to comply, and state judicial authorities ousted him as a result.
The Alabama Republican lost a special U.S. Senate election in December after several women came forward with sexual abuse allegations against him.
Democratic opponents of the proposal say it would violate the separation of church and state, the AP reports. They also worry public schools may have to pay attorneys’ fees if they face lawsuits over the displays.
Critics also said the legislation was a part of a GOP push to get conservative voters to the polls during a state election year.
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union claimed the bill did nothing to expand or limit religious freedom protections that are already guaranteed under the First Amendment. 
“This is absolutely a waste of the state’s time and potentially money,” Executive Director Randall Marshall said in a statement. “Particularly when Alabama is facing so many other problems like failing public schools and overcrowded prisons.”
Republican supporters of the bill said it is an affirmation of the right to religious liberty. The state has had a “religious freedom” amendment on the books since 1998, passed in response to the perceived weakening of religious protections.
“I wish and pray that we get to a point where people would be free to express faith without fear of being sued,” Rep. Danny Garrett, a Republican, told the AP.
Democratic Rep. Berry Forte said it’s not important to display the Ten Commandments, but to live by them. 
“The devil can display the Ten Commandments,” Forte told AL.com.
Ten Commandments displays have remained a contentious issue in many states. Last June, a privately funded monument to the biblical laws went up outside the Arkansas State Capitol with the state Legislature’s approval. Less than 24 hours later, a man drove a car into the display. The destroyed monument will likely be replaced this April.

WICHITA, Kansas ― A trio of anti-Muslim Kansas militiamen who discussed plans to murder Somali refugees were hoodwinked by fake news on Facebook and unfairly exploited by a federal government targeting them for their conservative beliefs, their defense attorneys argued this week.
Curtis Allen, Patrick Stein and Gavin Wright were ensnared in a FBI sting that wrapped up just weeks before the 2016 presidential election. The government says the men plotted to bomb an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, that housed Somali refugees they called “cockroaches.” The domestic terrorism investigation involved an informant who had infiltrated the so-called Crusaders militia group as well as undercover FBI agents, all of whom are expected to testify at the federal trial now unfolding in Wichita.
Rich Federico, a federal public defender who previously represented Guantanamo detainees as a JAG Corps officer, told the nearly all-white jury on Thursday that the government exploited Allen’s beliefs and his need for companionship. He described Allen as a “very politically conservative man” who viewed the 2016 presidential campaign as critical to the country’s future. Allen, his lawyer said, thought that President Barack Obama would declare martial law if Donald Trump captured the presidency.
“Hatred is not a crime in this country,” Federico told jurors. He called the violent language used by the defendants ― and recorded by the FBI informant ― mere chatter and bluster.
“Locker room talk,” Federico said, echoing the phrase then-candidate Trump used to describe the “Access Hollywood” tape in which he discussed how he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was famous.
Building a bomb, Federico told the jury, requires money, material and knowledge. “Curtis Allen lacked all three,” he said. “The FBI created and directed all of this. You will see no evidence in this case that was not planned and directed other than by the FBI.”
James Pratt, the attorney representing Stein, said he wouldn’t deny that his client had expressed great hatred for Muslims, especially when he was egged on or faced no pushback. He said Stein was a man who loved his country and his freedoms, which he feared he’d lose through terrorism and an “out of control” government.
But the government, Pratt said, saw Stein’s extreme views as an “opportunity” to create “chargeable offenses,” taking advantage of “chaos news” that had people like Stein believing a civil war was coming.
The country was sharply divided during the 2016 election, Pratt argued, and the media fed into the division by reporting on it non-stop. If you read conservative news, the lawyer said, you thought Hillary Clinton was a criminal, Obama was letting in hordes of Muslim immigrants, and the federal government was coming to get your guns. If you read liberal news, he said, you thought Trump was a racist unqualified to be president who planned to kick out Mexican immigrants and impose a Muslim ban.
“Hate ruled the day and the ratings. Left hating right, right hating left. And it was into this mix that we land,” Pratt said.
“At the end of this trial, chances are that you will not like Patrick Stein,” Pratt told jurors. But he said they would need more than dislike to find him guilty.
Kari Schmidt, the lawyer defending Wright, described him to jurors as a “very lonely man” who returned to southwest Kansas because his father had died and he was looking for new social circles. Wright often had to travel for business, she said, which made it difficult for him to connect with people.
“Gavin was having a hard time making friends,” Schmidt told jurors. “He was very lonely.”
At the beginning of their acquaintance, Wright didn’t care very much for Stein and thought his rants were over the top, Schmidt said. He did like Dan Day, the FBI informant in the case. Wright hosted “bull sessions” at his business where the group would rant and rave and complain, Schmidt said, but it didn’t amount to much.
His lawyer called Wright a bad judge of character. “He talked like them to try to fit in,” Schmidt said.
The government, in their own opening statement, said the defendants did a lot more than talk.
“This wasn’t just words. The defendants took action,” said Risa Berkower, a prosecutor with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. 
Berkower said that the group did extensive research and developed a specific plan, that they actually made explosives, and that they went to a bomb maker they thought could help them out. 
“They wanted to slaughter Muslims” in order to send a message that such people were “not welcome in Garden City, not welcome in Kansas, not welcome in America,” she said.
Berkower tried to head off criticisms of Day, the FBI’s paid informant. She described him as a guy who was big on the Second Amendment and thought radical Islamic terrorism was a threat to America. But he wasn’t totally comfortable with a lot of the extremist rhetoric coming from militiamen he encountered. And she said he couldn’t stand the thought of walking away with “the blood of innocents on his hands” when he realized how much flat-out hatred of Muslims some of those he encountered had.
Working as an informant was the hardest, scariest thing Day had ever done, Berkower said, but he agreed to pretend to go along with the plan and record the defendants’ conversations. The prosecutor called Day a “regular Joe” and said that being an informant wasn’t like it looked in the movies. There were no agents waiting outside in a van. Often, she said, it was just Day with a recording device.
“Dan was on his own,” she said.
The trial, expected to last six weeks, will be a test of the federal government’s ability to prosecute people charged in a sting operation that targeted non-Muslim domestic extremists. The tactic has been successfully used against Islamic extremists, but they are easier to prosecute because federal law makes it illegal to give any kind of support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.
Prosecuting domestic terrorists is harder, as the First Amendment protects a wide range of hateful rhetoric, and judges and juries are often more open to constitutional arguments when the defendants aren’t Muslim or otherwise viewed as somehow less than American. The government will have to prove that the defendants’ speech went beyond any First Amendment protections.
The United States lacks a federal statute broadly criminalizing domestic terrorism. The FBI Agents Association has been pushing for a law that would make such cases easier to prosecute.

The origins of today’s crisis in Labour date back to the 19th century, and ever since Jews have been seen as a problem by a strain of socialist thought


Sun 1 Apr 2018 01.01 EDT


Last modified on Tue 3 Apr 2018 06.28 EDT


So, we’re back to the “Jewish Question”? The current antisemitism crisis on the left has not come out of nowhere. Instead, it has its roots in a tradition on the left itself, which, at best, has always had difficulty in responding swiftly to antisemitism and, at worst, excused or condoned, even promoted it. It is not, of course, the only tradition on the left, but unless we understand this history, we won’t get very far in resolving today’s crisis.
We need, above all, to think about why some on the left have always seen Jews as a problem and why they have helped the idea of a “Jewish Question” to re-emerge with such potency. At root is the thought that if antisemitism exists, it must have something to do with how Jews supposedly behave. That supposed behaviour may be described in different ways – sometimes it has an economic character, sometimes a social one, sometimes a political one. But what is common is the idea that Jews are to blame for antisemitism and that to protest against them is understandable, or even necessary.
This first became a serious problem on the left in the late 19th century, as antisemitism first became a political force in the modern world. Some on the left flirted with the response that there might be something progressive about antisemitism: that it was a kind of anti-capitalism, however crude, which could be harnessed to the socialist cause. They also thought that philosemitism was more of a problem, because it supposedly encouraged Jews to make too much of (or even fabricate) antisemitism and to resist assimilation. One criticism of this approach at the time was to call it the “socialism of fools”, a problematic formulation because it suggested that antisemitism was still some kind of socialism.
As antisemitism was radicalised by the Nazis – it no longer being enough to exclude Jews when they should be wiped off the face of the Earth – this way of thinking made it difficult for too many on the left to prioritise solidarity with Jews. Neither the Social Democrats nor the Communists in Germany made opposition to antisemitism a major issue, nor did the Resistance across Europe. The fear was that to highlight the fight against antisemitism would alienate potential supporters. This is not to ignore some wonderful examples of solidarity, though the repeated invocations of Cable Street can give a misleading picture. The Communist party soon switched to loyally supporting the Hitler-Stalin pact, which effectively delivered large numbers of Jews up to the Nazis.
When the Soviet Union was finally forced to fight the Nazis, the suffering of Jews was deliberately and repeatedly downplayed. But after the war, things got much worse. The Soviet Union not only suppressed knowledge of what had been done to Jews but launched its own vicious antisemitic project, one that would have culminated in another genocide had Stalin not died.
This campaign matters because it was around this time that some key elements of today’s antisemitism on the left were first formulated. The charge laid against Jews then was that they were cosmopolitans and Zionists. This may seem like a bizarre contradiction: how can one, after all, be both a cosmopolitan and a Zionist? But what connected them is the idea that Jews are a problem, that as cosmopolitans they are more loyal to each other across national borders and, as Zionists, are loyal to another, foreign state. The charge of cosmopolitanism is heard less frequently these days, though one finds echoes of it in the idea that Jews are responsible for the evils of globalisation. The charge of Zionism, though, has now become absolutely central to today’s version of the “Jewish Question”. What began as a Stalinist cry was taken up in some on the New Left, which helped shape the world view of Jeremy Corbyn and many of his supporters.
For both Stalinists and that part of the New Left, Zionism is a racist ideology that pits the interests of Jews against the interests of everyone else. Furthermore, the state of Israel is an integral part of the western imperialist power structure that exploits and oppresses the rest of the world and the Palestinians in particular, whose land Jews have plundered and colonised and whom they keep in a state of permanent subjugation.
The Soviet Union formulated its approach within the context of the cold war, when it often appeared to support anti-colonial, national liberation struggles, although only for strategic reasons. Those on the left who (rightly if often too uncritically) supported those struggles, especially in Vietnam, where the Americans were so clearly the enemy, slipped fatally, however, into embracing this anti-Zionism into their world view, even though the Israel-Palestine conflict had such clearly different roots.
At the same time, they found it unbearable to acknowledge what was glaringly obvious – that the establishment of the state of Israel was profoundly connected to the Holocaust, which had changed everything for Jews. To integrate anti-Zionism into an anti-imperialist, anti-western, anti-American world view therefore also meant either denying or (better) reinterpreting the Holocaust. Holocaust denial is not an accidental feature of today’s antisemitism, but it is more common to downplay what happened to Jews as Jews. So the Holocaust has to be thought about only in universal terms, as only one genocide among many and one that supposedly excludes the others. (Actually, of course, it is the other way around: thinking about the Holocaust helps people think about other genocides.) Indeed, some have gone further. Not content with accusing Israel of being like apartheid South Africa, it is supposedly guilty of genocide itself… against the Palestinians.
If such purported behaviour makes people antisemitic, it is understandable and part of a fundamentally progressive view of the world, which can be harnessed to the cause. We are back then to where we started, with Jews as the problem, only with this difference: what was previously attributed to Jews inside nation states is now attributed to the Jewish state on the international stage.
There has always been, though, another tradition on the left, which has never accepted the very idea of a “Jewish Question”. What it understands is that there is a question of antisemitism; that Jews are not responsible for antisemitism but antisemites are; that Jews are not a problem but antisemites are. Antisemitism is not something that should be excused or condoned. It has to be fought wherever it shows its face, even – and sadly now more than ever – when that face is on the left.

Carolyn Harris won support of Theresa May for campaign she led since losing her son in 1989

Child burial fees are to be waived after a campaign led by an MP who needed a loan to bury her eight-year-old son after he was killed in a car accident. 
Carolyn Harris, the MP for Swansea East, had called on the government to cover the costs of burials and cremations to help parents struggling to pay for their child’s funeral. 
Theresa May, the prime minister, has announced the establishment of the Children’s Funeral Fund, which will pay for the costs of the burials and bring England in line with Wales. 
Harris said: “I celebrated last year when the Welsh government gave me the Children’s Funeral Fund, I’ve celebrated when every local authority right across this country has done this. 
“But at last after so much pressure and so much time, families right across the United Kingdom can know that if they’re ever in that terrible, terrible position when they lose a child, that there will now be a pot of money available to make sure that child has a dignified and respectful funeral. 
Harris has long campaigned on the issue, with her eight-year-old son Martin having been killed in 1989, having previously said the establishment of a fund was “the dignified, compassionate and sympathetic thing to do”. 
May hailed the “dignity and strength” of Harris, adding: “No parent should ever have to endure the unbearable loss of a child – a loss that no amount of time will ever truly heal. But in the raw pain of immediate loss, it cannot be right that grieving parents should have to worry about how to meet the funeral costs for a child they hoped to see grow into adulthood. In the darkest moment of any parent’s life there is little light – but there can be support.
“That is why I have asked for the Children’s Funeral Fund to be set up in England. For Carolyn, in memory of her son Martin, and in support of all those parents overwhelmed by such harrowing loss.”
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the establishment of a fund was “very welcome and wonderful news”.
This is very welcome and wonderful news. A simple piece of dignity for bereaved families.Huge credit to @CarolynHarris24 and the Sunday Mirror who tirelessly kept up the pressure when the Government was dragging its feet.https://t.co/WBb2SOAbbI
He said: “This is a simple piece of dignity for bereaved families across the country, secured through tenacious campaigning by Labour’s Carolyn Harris who tirelessly kept up the pressure when the government was dragging its feet. No parent who has gone through the heart-breaking experience of losing a child should be left struggling to cover the cost of a funeral.”
In her Easter message on Sunday, the prime minister hailed the “triumph of the human spirit” in the wake of last year’s terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire. May said she had seen for herself how survivors and victims had drawn strength from their families and their communities.
May, the daughter of a vicar, said the message of the Bible story offered the “inspiring promise of new life” in times of adversity. 
“Easter is the most important time in the Christian calendar. A time when we remember Christ’s sacrifice on the cross, and give thanks for the promise of redemption afforded by his resurrection,” she said.
“Over the last year, Britain has faced some dark moments, from the terrorist attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge, at Manchester Arena and Finsbury Park, and the fire at Grenfell Tower. 
“I know from speaking to the victims and survivors of these terrible events how vital the love and support they have received from their friends, family and neighbours has been to them as they begin to rebuild their lives. In the bravery of those facing adversity, the dedication of our emergency services, and the generosity of local communities, we see the triumph of the human spirit.
“The Easter story contains an inspiring promise of new life and the triumph of hope. For Christians around the world facing persecution, the message of the cross and the resurrection help them to stand firm in their faith.”", religion

Shahab Adris, a UK citizen and a Muslim activist, wants to reverse the hate campaign against Muslims which is in progress. Many Britons have received letters with the caption “Punish a Muslim” asking people to terrorize the UK Muslim community. The campaign, started by Adris, copies the style of Punish a Muslim but relabels it as “Love a Muslim”. The latter urges kindness instead of violence. 
To give an example, 10 points would be awarded if the recipient smiles at a Muslim. Presenting a Muslim with cake and coffee earns the giver 25 points. The points increase with the complexity of benevolence or money spent. For example, 1,000 points are given for raising much-needed funds to assist Syria or Iraq Muslims. Adris is the regional manager for Muslim Engagement and Development, an advocacy group. According to the Adris, the “points” system for Punish a Muslim was frightening. It encouraged violence and led to feelings of anxiety in British Muslim communities.  

Adris has stated the response is excellent from both Muslims and non-Muslims. He expected a good response from the former but was surprised by the welcoming response from non-Muslims as well. Many non-Muslims have promised to do something with their Muslim colleagues. He told a prominent radio channel that as Muslims, his community always wanted to love everyone and unite people independent of their background, saying that the same campaign could be labeled a human day, a Jew day, a Christian day, or even an atheist day. In his letter, he urged the reader to be a special person and not a normal person. The reader is encouraged to show love to fellow Muslim brethren.
What a response to the similar #hate letter. Thank you to those behind this initiative. 
Let’s find and thank them personally… well, we can at least try to find them 😆 #LoveAMuslimDay#SpreadLoveNotHate#Love#Respect#Muslim#Humanity#tolerance#Batley#Dewsbury pic.twitter.com/wiGoC5v0Jd

Thelma Walker, the Labour MP elected from Colne Valley, supported such actions. She, and many others have termed it as an ideal response to bigotry and hate. The campaign’s growing popularity was proven when Yasmin Qureshi, the Labour MP, has raised this issue in House of Commons. The MP gave details of the letters which were received by many residents of Sheffield, Bradford, Cardiff, Leicester, and London. 
However, this has drawn a backlash from extremist anti-Muslim groups. British law enforcement authorities dealing with counter-terrorism had said earlier that it has received a number of reports of probable malicious communications which were sent to individuals all over the United Kingdom. Counter-Terrorism Policing North East said that anyone who has received such hate mail should immediately contact local police.

People have all sort of rituals for preparing for important sporting events. Some athletes don’t shave, wear their “lucky” socks, or don’t take a shower. Fans can be even more strange with taking whatever action they think boosts their favorite teams chance of success.
In Japan, pre-game rituals are historically rooted in culture and religion. Shinto, one of the two major religions in Japan, is followed by nearly 20% of the population. Shinto’s foundation is in polytheism. There are over 100,000 Shinto shrines in Japan dedicated to the different deities, spirits, and religious figures. 
Several of these shrines are directly dedicated to sports. Have a big race, figure skating event, or Olympic event coming up involving legs? Then go to the Goou Jinja Shinto Temple, dedicated to the gods who protect legs and the lower back. It is also where athletes go who are recovering from an injury to pray for a healthy recovery.
What about soccer? The World Cup is coming up and many players will be leaving balls at the Shiramine Jinguh Shrine, the homeplace of the “ballgame gods.” One can find numerous soccer balls left by teams from Japanese soccer leagues and the national team, hoping to find favor to help them get that penalty kick.
Martial arts, horse racing, dressage, and Sumo are just some of the sports that have dedicated temples to them. But atheletes do not just go for the sporting gods. When the Japanese Rugby Team was getting ready for the Rugby World Cup they visited Shinto Shrines to assist in personal reflection and meditation to center themselves before the tournament. 
While there is no direct proof that praying to these gods leads to success, there is psychological evidence that players that engage in rituals are more confident when playing and feel more relaxed dealing with the challenges of playing in front of large audiences or televised games.

Vincent Furnier, more famous by his stage name of Alice Cooper, was extremely sick when he was he was younger. He was throwing up blood and the doctors told him to stop drinking. The singer had by then competed in multiple drinking sessions with other legends like Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison, both of whom died in their 20s. Doctors had already diagnosed Cooper as a “classic alcoholic.” He pledged not to touch alcohol after he left the hospital. Not a drop passed his lips afterward. He credits his startling recovery to God.

Today, Cooper looks great. The black outfit he regularly wears suits him. The crucifix and the dyed black hair adds to his rock star persona. He regularly does grueling tours, staying on the road for days, and even months, on end. He claims his shows are better now than what they were in his 20s and 30s.
Cooper, who is best known for songs like “School's Out” and “Welcome to My Nightmare” said both he and his wife are devout Christians. The-70-year-old said nothing in Christianity proscribes that a rockstar cannot be a good Christian. His family was fully Christian, with his grandfather an evangelist and his father a pastor. He once tried to leave the church but came back to it and stayed. According to him, many people have a misconception about Christianity. They think devout Christians pray all day and hold right-wing political views. He said the only thing a devout Christian has is a personal relationship with Christ.
Cooper has stayed with the same woman he married in 1976. Being unfaithful to his wife has never occurred to him. He goes to church every Sunday and reads the Bible daily. The rockstar proudly informs that his kids never had any kind of trouble with alcohol. They do not do drugs either.
Just found out NBC is doing Jesus Christ Superstar live on Easter day this year. I'm pretty excited because that's one of my favorite musicals AND Alice Cooper is playing King Herod.

Cooper has a link with the Bible in his professional life as well. Alice Cooper fans will enjoy seeing him again as King Herod in ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ , a part which he first played in 2000. He got the role when Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the writers of Jesus Christ Superstar insisted on him playing the crucial role. The present NBC produced classic stars John Legend. When asked about his inspiration, Cooper mentioned the late Alan Rickman, who among his many stellar performances played a pivotal character in the Harry Potter movie series.

Only a few weeks after two women, identified by law enforcement as Elizabeth Dauenhauer and Tahnee Gonzales, filmed themselves as they vandalized a Tempe, Arizona mosque, local interfaith community members showed up in large numbers to stand united with local Muslims. Kristy Sabbah, the office manager of Tempe's Islamic Community Center, said messages of support continue to pour in even now.
The people who gathered at the Mosque grounds were not there to erase that memory. They wanted to prove hate could be overcome. Shayna Stevens, a board member of CAIR-Arizona and a Muslim American, said what excites her is that the same playground which the two women described as disease-ridden is the same place where children learn to love. Hate has been abolished in favor of love. The mosque is an old structure and a short distance away from Arizona State University. Gonzales and Dauenhauer did a live stream of themselves ransacking the interiors of the mosque. They also mocked Muslims as dog eaters and child molesters. The two even encouraged three children to take copies of the Quran and pamphlets from the courtyard of the mosque. Gonzales is 32-years-old and Dauenhauer is 51-years-old.

Both Dauenhauer and Gonzales were arrested on burglary charges on the evidence of their Facebook live video. Gonzales appears to lecture the concerned children along with her Facebook audience in the video. She explained how the U.S. is being destroyed by Muslims. She also claims that Muslims worship the devil.
What especially riled Sabbah and the mosque community was how both the women seemingly encouraged the children to be blatantly Islamophobic and racist. A young girl could be heard making troubling statements like Muslims wait for a time when they could rape non-Muslims and that “they smell like goats.” Sabbath said it is her hope that the two women will be prosecuted to the maximum extent. However, she hoped the children will learn to be compassionate as children at that age are smart and have pure hearts.
Tempe's Islamic Community Center partnered with several interfaith and local Muslim organizations to host an event at the mosque. The event, named Love and Coffee was fully live-streamed on Facebook. Over 200 community members attended the event.

Representative Charlie Dent, a GOP lawmaker, has challenged Trump’s supporters: He asked how they can justify their support towards Trump at this point. His argument is that the supporters have deliberately turned a blind eye to the increasing number of scandals emanating on a regular basis from the White House. The Republican expressed his personal concerns during an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN.
Anderson Cooper questioned Dent on what he assumed evangelicals would do if a democratic President had the same scandals. For example, a scenario where Obama was found to be linked to a scandal like the affair between Trump and Stormy Daniels. Dent said the GOP supporting evangelicals would likely go into town and “scream themselves hoarse” to demand that the president resign from his post. 
Republican Rep. Charlie Dent on Stormy Daniels scandal: The less President Trump says about it the better https://t.co/i3CzszGste https://t.co/VOCN8l4zW4
— Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) March 28, 2018

According to Dent, if President Trump’s tactics were followed by a Democrat, the Republicans will allege human rights violations at every step. He pointed out that if a Democratic White House showed a conciliatory stand towards Moscow, “hell would have broken loose.”
Dent has made it clear that he will not stand for re-election. He is one of the increasing number of GOP lawmakers who are now opting out of the political race. The next election is in November. He will not be a part of the electoral process. Dent pointed out that the upcoming vote to take place in the midterm can be construed as a referendum on Trump. The vote will also reveal whether the president’s scandals have had an effect on voters. In his opinion, the scandals are more explicit and prominent enough to have lasting effects on the midterm elections.
Dent made it clear he does not care about any president like Donald Trump who lives by a certain personal code which many will find extremely objectionable. Dent seemed particularly upset by the hypocrisy of individuals not being consistent on the application of their religious values.

Tomb  inside the rotunda of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem’s Old City where Christians believe Jesus was buried.
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a church within the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. The church contains the two holiest sites in Christendom: Calvary/Golgotha where Jesus Christ was crucified and the empty tomb of Jesus, where He was buried, and later resurrected. The control of the church is shared by several Christian denominations and also some secular entities. Over the centuries, the church suffered many damages.
In the year 614, the building was damaged by a fire. In 746, the structure suffered severe damages due to an earthquake. The dome of the structure was damaged in an early ninth-century earthquake. In 966, a riot caused the basilica to burn again. In 1009, Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the complete destruction of the church. Only a few parts of the church remained. In 1027, Caliph Ali az-Zahir agreed for the church to be rebuilt and redecorated. The work was completed in 1048.
Recently, the Israeli government announced that nearly two centuries of erosion has made the church unstable, that the site is in grave danger of collapsing. This prompted three of the prominent Christian denominations controlling the church, the Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, and Greek Orthodox, to join hands and begin a year-long project to repair, reinforce, and conserve the church. The estimated cost of the project is $3.4 million. The project is currently funded by contributions from the three denominations, as well as an undisclosed amount (donation) from King Abdullah of Jordan.
In an interview given to Jordan Times, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, said that they are reaping the fruits of the efforts put in by them in an age when on the one side of the world the sectarian wars are burning countries. King Abdullah has constantly reiterated that the Christian and Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem are a red line that Jordan will not allow to be crossed. Theophilos III also said that the nation has always upheld its historic and religious responsibilities, and it continues to do so.
The Church of the Holy Sepulcher serves also as the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch.
Last year, in a show of solidarity, Eastern Orthodox Church's Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople and Pope Francis met and prayed together at the Holy Sepulchre, for the first time in fifty years.

One reason why there has been no major restoration project in the past has been due to the constant rivalry between the various Christian denominations. According to Pope Francis, it is necessary to believe that all the obstacles that stand in the way of the communion between the different Christian denominations may also be removed just like how the stone that was covering the tomb was cast aside.

Chemical tests of mortar discovered in a limestone cave dates the Tomb of Jesus to 345 C.E.  The cave was hidden beneath Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The date confirms it to be made during the rule of Emperor Constantine. The latter ruled over the Roman Empire during 4th century C.E. There is a high possibility this tomb is the same tomb located by the envoys sent by Emperor Constantine about 20 years prior to the making of the mortar.
It was important to find the date as the Church of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem had suffered earthquakes, attacks, and fires. The structure was obliterated during the start of the 11th century. It was then rebuilt by successive emperors. Modern scholars have thus questioned whether Christ's burial spot could possibly be identified. It is to be mentioned that a Roman delegation identified Christ's burial place when the emperor sent a delegation to find it about 17 centuries before.
When the representatives sent by Constantine arrived in 325 C.E., and asked the local Roman garrison about the Tomb of Jesus, they were sent to a Roman temple constructed around 200 years before. The structure was then razed. Explorations during that era revealed a limestone cave tomb. The roof of the cave was taken off to expose the tomb's interiors. The Edicule was then constructed around it.
Skeptics may argue that it is archaeologically not possible to determine whether this particular tomb is the burial site of Jesus of Nazareth. The Jew and founder of Christianity was, as per the New Testament, was crucified within the boundaries of Jerusalem city any year between 30 C.E. to 33 C.E. The results of the excavation puts the tomb complex during the reign of Constantine- the first Christian emperor of the Roman Empire. Archaeologists opened the probable Jesus' tomb for first time in October 2016. This happened when considerable restoration was done on the Edicule, the shrine enclosing the tomb. The work was done by an interdisciplinary group from Athens' National Technical University.
How old is the tomb of Jesus Christ? Now we know. @AleteiaEn https://t.co/9MeacnoWBV
— Lloyd I. Cadle (@lloydICadle) November 29, 2017

A long shelf or the burial bed is the tomb's main feature. As per tradition, Christ's body was laid here after crucifixion. These shelves were common during Jesus's time in tombs of wealthy Jews during the first century. Latter accounts written by pilgrims mention a marble cladding covering the burial bed. It is believed that it was present from the middle of 1300s.

A short time ago in a land far, far away, or basically in the last couple of days in England, there has been a growing anger over the display of an art piece in an Episcopal church. The piece shows a Stormtrooper, one of the evil goons in the Star Wars movies, displayed on a cross exactly like you would see Jesus Christ appear.
The Saint Stephen Walbrook Church in London was displaying the piece as part of the Missing Tom Fund, a charitable organization that was created in 2003 when Tom Moore disappeared. The reverend at the church stated the piece was designed to be provocative and illicit response about the controversy of the Christ Cross and if Jesus exists for alien civilizations. 
The Crucified Stormtrooper at the heart of #stationsofthecross a new show by @ArtBelow at @StStephenEC4N pic.twitter.com/Xybim6uJAB

While some parishioners did not mind the exhibit, others felt it offensive to the teachings of the church. People pointed to Exodus in the Bible, where God declares Himself a “jealous god” and states in clear terms to not create a similar image. One could argue that the art piece was just that, a piece of art and not a form of religious worship. However, the negative reaction was large enough that the exhibit was moved from a prominent place in the center of the church to a more hidden area in the back. 
The piece, called “Stations of the Cross” will be put on auction soon. The initial asking price is over $14,000. One wonders if people would have been more tolerant if the image was “the most hated upon alien in the galaxy,” Jar Jar Binks.

If reports are to be believed, Justin Bieber's upcoming album will be a Christian one . He will forgo his usual lean towards partying with scantily clad women and sing about God. Bieber's turn towards Christianity is not a first among pop stars. Bob Dylan did the same in the 1970s. Dylan released three upfront religious albums when he transformed into a born-again Christian during that time. Bieber will be joining the likes of Snoop Dogg who just released a no holds barred gospel album in March. Snoop, who incidentally counts Bieber as his friend, released his Christian offering after several hip-hop albums.
News of Bieber's Christian-inspired production came from The Sun tabloid. The site allegedly interacted with a music industry insider who had all the information of Bieber's latest venture. According to The Sun website, the Canadian singer is searching for songs which mirror where he is presently in his life when it comes to spirituality. The site further goes on to say he has always been of a religious bent and it was no surprise to see him come closer to Hillsong Church. The church changed his life and gave him a different outlook.
Justin Bieber is recording a Christian album and I AM STOKED
— Morg (@morgannsnyder) March 27, 2018

Bieber is not the only contemporary musician to blatantly show religiosity at every turn. Beyoncé, to give an example, has always been open about her beliefs, however, only a few musicians weave their music to particularly cater to religious audiences. This is as the market size for Christian music is much smaller than a secular one. It thus comes as a kind of mild surprise Bieber wants to craft a popular religious conversion album. 
As per The Sun, Bieber has not been working actively on new music since following his last tour. The time he spent in church, however, revitalized him. He presently works with the identical team which assisted him to make Purpose, his last album. He has reshaped his sound so the music and the lyrics are in sync with the beliefs and values of the church. 
The tabloid website said there will be a new take on his old topics of redemption and true love. The new album may surprise some fans.

The music-loving public has been infuriated by Bob Dylan's twists and turns during his career. There were many such instances, like the one in 1965 when he switched from the acoustic guitar to an electric one during the Newport Folk Festival. The biggest howl from the public was however reserved for the time when he became a devout Christian during the sunset of the 1970s. This time period has now been made into a film, intriguingly titled The Trouble No More. The documentary will be broadcast on BBC March 30.
Dylan's religious period, starting from 1979 and ending in 1981, spanned three albums. All three,  Slow Train Coming, Shot of Love, and Saved, pushed his music into a radical new direction. They went from clearly secular to intensely religious. Reaction among his fans was naturally bewilderment. One of them even complained in the documentary that he felt cheated, saying if he wanted to hear sermons, he would have visited a church and not a Bob Dylan show.

The lyrics contained the same apocalyptic and visionary poetry which characterized the singer's career. Dylan was accompanied by his trusted backup band consisting of, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Keyboardist Spooner Oldham and Fred Tackett playing the guitar. He also had talented backup singers like Mary Elizabeth Bridges, Clydie King, Regina McCrary, Mona Lisa Young, and Gwen Evans. The director has intercut every song with a Luc Sante written homily delivered by Michael Shannon playing a preacher.

“People say there are no atheists in foxholes. A lot of people think this is a good argument against atheism. Personally, I think it’s a much better argument against foxholes.”Kurt Vonnegut
We seem to live in a time filled with world-ending threats. Turn on the news and hear of your impending doom: environmental destruction, nuclear war, biological terrorism, starvation, economic collapse, asteroids, solar flares, cancer, and a host of both real and imagined problems exist. 
People looking to capitalize on the fear that this produces will sometimes refer back to the old adage “there are not any Atheists in foxholes.” Meaning, in a do-or-die situation everyone will turn to religion. The underlying assumption is that everyone who has turned their back on faith actually believes in God, but that the cynicism they have surrounded themselves with only melts in a situation that requires divine intervention. Some have taken this literally and talk about the overabundance of religion in the military, while others use it to attack Atheism as a concept.

Nope, not buying it. There are several faulty assumptions and factual errors this statement forces us to believe. 
First is the idea this is an attack on Atheism. It is actually an attack on Christianity. God wants you to have faith in Him “Jesus told him, ‘Don’t be afraid; just believe.’” If you only call out to God because you are in crisis, you don’t really have faith, you are just desperate. This is a different version of Pascal’s Wager, where you decided on your deathbed to succumb to religion because the opportunity cost of roasting in hell is greater than losing some dignity to recite some words. Faith needs to be a consistent factor. For someone to claim to be truly religious they need to believe all the time, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” Shouldn’t Christians be angry at those who pick and choose when to believe in God and are more likely to forsake Him when things are going well? If you had a friend who only called when they needed help moving, you probably would not call them a friend, but a freeloader or parasite. 
Second, just because someone cries out “oh God” or “help me God” does not actually mean they believe. This has more to do with the vocabulary of a culture than a particular religious view. One in four Americans does not have any faith. That is tens of millions of people. But I am sure we would find a large percentage of them saying “God darn it” or “oh God” or “God help me.” This is because these expressions have been associated with certain situations or feelings. When people are saying these expressions they could just be saying “well this is terrible, I am scared, and I hope it gets better.” 
Third, it is factually incorrect. There are Atheists in foxholes. Currently, over seven percent of U.S. military personnel in combat zones are officially listed as Atheists. Several armed services have stopped requiring incoming soldiers to pledge to God in their allegiance speech. Even the army doesn’t truly believe there are no Atheists in foxholes. 
Research has shown nonbelievers are less likely to be panicked with “death anxiety” than believers. Additionally, research has shown that nonbelievers actually strengthen their beliefs rather than turn to religion. If anything people become more likely to believe in science when faced with overwhelming odds. While there is a bit of a discussion on why that occurs it could be because you trust what is in front of you, what has worked, as your salvation. 

There seems to be only one consistent factor that determines if a soldier becomes more religious, which is if they disliked the war they fought in. This may mean that while there are Atheists in foxholes, religion becomes a way for people to make sense after experiencing the horrors of war without having confidence in the cause. 
This expression needs to disappear. It has become a rallying cry to mock Atheists as hypocritical but it really mocks the very notion of faith and the conviction of the service of our armed forces. There are Atheists in foxholes.

The Catholic Church is in a bit of a crisis. Even with the surging popularity of Pope Francis, the church is losing a large number of followers. Less than twenty percent of Americans regularly go to church. In addition, the number of priests has been shrinking, forcing a fewer number to have to cover multiple parishes, making a personal connection to the Church that much harder to maintain. 
The solution may not come exclusively from a spiritual basis, but a business one. The Catholic Church should give priests bonuses. This does not mean priests should get money for doing something special. Money is one of the last motivators for the clergy: “Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh, I am filling up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ on behalf of his body, which is the church, of which I am a minister in accordance with God’s stewardship given to me to bring to completion for you the word of God.” (Colossians 1:24-25) But it can become an incentive system for priests to be rewarded for innovative thinking on how to spread their faith and build their community.
What would this look like? 
Priests who are able to reach new inter-faith connections, draw in new parishioners, or establish new community service events would get additional funding from their Archdiocese. While individual members of a church can give direct donations, it is estimated only about six percent goes to that specific church. Therefore, even if a church is winning the financial support of the local community, it doesn’t always translate into large sums of cash. Additionally, this could be used to address the issue of priests who have to run multiple churches without any uniquely distributed funds. 
The ability to reward programs could lead to them becoming models for other priests. World Religion News interviewed a founder of ChurchMarketingSucks.com, Brad Abare, who stated there are techniques that are not tried by many church officials because they might not be savvy in technology. Positive incentives have been shown to increase innovation and performance in the private sector, what makes this any different?
Of course, a committee would have to be established to ensure that it was not purely a hunt for numbers, but for authentic interactions within the community at large. Programs like Success For Youth in Cleveland that provide job and life skills training to younger members could be something that gets rewarded with additional funding. 
While this happens at a larger structural level, there does not appear to be a consistent framework for rewarding individual priests, although there is a suggested payment window that individuals can give for specific ceremonies that a priest performs, like a wedding. 
A priest could also refuse to take the funds. The Catholic Church has a provision where priests are given a base amount of money if they do not want to take stipends from individuals for performing ceremonies. The priest could have the option of the money being donated to a local charity. 
Given the importance that Pope Francis has put on promoting social justice and community engagement this feels exactly in line with his mission. His reforms and consolidation of the Vatican Bank has also shown a desire to create more transparency with how funds are distributed within the Catholic Church. While money is not the solution, unique and powerful ideas need the ability to grow into larger movements.

It is a new week and a new apology to a Christian leader. This time it is MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle’s apology to Trump’s new economic advisor Larry Kudlow. Kudlow was being interviewed by Ruhle and mentioned that he would become economic advisor “if it was God’s will.” Ruhle later commented that it seemed an odd statement for an economic advisor to have and then later joked about having to give facts and data to a president that has made over 2,000 false statements at the start of the new year saying that “well, as Larry Kudlow says, ‘It’s God’s Will.’” Kudlow was not pleased and took to Twitter to comment. “Sneering at faith, and God’s will, @SRuhle @MSNBC . Why still on air? She apparently believes people in business & economics should not have faith.”

But this is problematic. First, when you become a public official you must accept public scrutiny. Anything you say may become a reason you are criticized. The Freedom of Speech allows public figures to be criticized, even mocked. This has been affirmed in several Supreme Court Decisions, most notably Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, when a religious figure argued that mocking him was not protected under the First Amendment. Yet it is protected. 
Therefore, the claim to fire someone because they said something you did not like is a dangerous knee-jerk reaction. But it is a popular one for attacks on the religious character of a public figure. When Joy Behar of The View made the point that Vice President Pence hearing Jesus talk to him seemed like a mental disorder, there was a spewing of rage and calls for her to be fired. She also had to apologize. 
As a reporter, a mom & a Catholic, I know words matter & I want to clear something up. I meant no offense when discussing @larry_kudlow’s WH appointment. I apologize if my comments came off as dismissive of his faith.I would never question another person’s believe in God.
— Stephanie Ruhle (@SRuhle) March 17, 2018

While both apologies were accepted, an important part of Christian ethics is forgiveness. Jesus tells his followers to forgive individuals as a fundamental part of being Christian. He states “bless those who curse you [and] pray for those who abuse you.” While it could be argued that the offending party needs to be repentant first, even Jesus asks for forgiveness of the Romans alhough “they do not know what they are doing.” So, the Christian thing would be to forgive the person instantly. 
It is reminiscent of a joke from comedian Bill Hicks. He is approached by an angry mob of people after a performance about his mocking of Christians in America. His reply? “Well then forgive me.” It seems that too quickly that Christians do the opposite of what Jesus taught, and need to endorse that universal ethic of love. 
Hey @larry_kudlow, you’re in govt now – whom else would you like removed from TV because their views don’t suit you? You’re welcome to attack @SRuhle on our show, but know that I’ve got my partner’s back. Try to be your best self: do your job with dignity & serve the country

Also imagine if the future economic advisor to America said, “well if Zoltar wills it” and then proceeded to say there was an interdimensional imp who controls reality and so if he became economic advisor it would be because of Zoltar. 
This is not to belittle the faith of millions of American Christians. But it begs the question: nearly a quarter of Americans are either Atheist or Agnostic. If they feel uneasy about someone who will deal with hard facts talking about something they see as a myth, why can’t they express their views? This is why Freedom of Speech is in place in America. Kudlow is entitled to speak about his religious faith while Ruhle is allowed to speak about her lack of conviction on that belief or make a joke. Neither voice should be smashed down. The legacy of our country and the will of Zoltar demands it.

Would anyone argue that Christians have a religious obligation to protect innocent people?
Of course not.
Christians have a duty to protect the innocent. This is made clear in numerous Biblical scripture and by the teachings of Jesus. Even St. Augustine, the creator of just war theory, believed that it was crucial for Christians to protect innocents.
Then why do Christians support private ownership of guns in America?
White, evangelical Christians are more likely to carry a gun (41% to 30% national average) and be against gun control (one-third to one-half national average). And many politicians are sending out their “prayers” to victims of the most recent mass school shooting in Florida. Interesting none of those politicians seem interested enough to send back their checks from the National Rifle Association.
But gun ownership in the United States does kill innocents. The Trump Administration and conservatives are quick to point out mental health as the reason for the Florida shooting. But other countries have people with mental health issues. Some conservatives will then say that it is “evil.” But the United States is not the only country with evil people. 
Then why do mass shootings happen in the United States nearly every day of the year? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that there are more guns than people in the United States. Or that while the United States has 4% of the world’s population it has over 40% of the total number of guns. 
The major justification that is given to keep guns by religious leaders is protection. One church leader said he felt “more comfortable” with his parishioners having concealed firearms with them in church. This is the tired false statement that guns provide personal protection. Yet for every justifiable homicide using guns, there are 32 murders, suicides, or accidental deaths using guns. That means that 31 innocent people have to die for every time someone is protected by using a gun. There is no justification in the Bible for this staggering sacrifice. As Jesus said “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.”
It makes more sense for Christians to not just be able in support of gun control, but the elimination of gun ownership.

If someone told you they were a Wiccan what would be your first reaction? Would you roll your eyes? Make a joke about Harry Potter or being a witch? Do you do the same when someone says they are a Christian?
Wiccans can have a difficult time being taken seriously by mainstream culture. When Wicca is mentioned on news organizations, people snicker or treat it as phony or illegitimate. Watch this segment on Fox News:

Even though Tucker Carlson later apologized, it demonstrates how little respect the organization gets. There are numerous articles online about how to deal with people acting rudely when you mention you are a Wiccan. 
Why does this occur? 
First, when we think of Wiccans we get images of witchcraft, which society has never been comfortable with. We used to burn women as witches and believed them to be engaging in evil acts. The Salem Witch Trials and Spanish Inquisition are parts of our history. Interestingly enough, the claim that Wiccans are devil worshipers cannot be more untrue. The devil is part of the Christian faith, not Wicca and so it is not a part of their worship. 
The media portrayal of witches has also been mostly one-sided. When we think of movies like Hocus Pocus, Witches, or the recent critically-acclaimed The Witch we conjure images of women eating children, turning people into frogs, and casting spells over a boiling cauldron. 

Which is part of the problem. There is something inherently sexist about the portrayal of witches. When you think about male magic users, Gandalf, Harry Potter, or Doctor Strange come to mind. Perhaps the use of magic by women, essentially the ability to change what is the natural order, seems like a dangerous proposition to male-dominated societies.
But it could also be misinformation. Wicca is a relatively new belief system when the phrase was first coined in 1954 by Gerald Gardner. It has no central book and the belief system is defined by the individual. Some worship in groups, called covens, while others worship alone. The central belief in spirituality and the unity of the Divine means that different deities are honored. There is also no inherent rule about proselytizing. Wiccans, as a general rule, do not go out to convert but believe in the spiritual journey being just that, a journey. And one that must be taken by each individual. This means there is less interaction with Wiccans and their communities, even though there are a number of examples of Wiccans being involved in civic and charitable causes.
Part of it could be because of the belief in magic. But most major religions have supernatural elements: resurrection, divine power, people talking to their deities or representatives. Vice President Pence has stated that Jesus talks to him. When Joy Behar of The View called it delusional, there was widespread criticism of her for violating his religious beliefs. This should be the same when criticizing a Wiccan for using spells. Everyone’s personal beliefs should be respected, not just the ones that are more mainstream. 
Wiccans are one of the fastest growing religions in the United States. There has been an estimated growth from 134,000 to 2,000,000 in less than 15 years. It could be because of what the Wiccan faith espouses: love of family, appreciation for both the spiritual and the physical, and respect for the environment. The freedom it entails could be seen as a potent alternative to religions with strict doctrine and sometimes is not always clear. For example, very few Christians follow all the rules of the Bible, including the Old Testament. A television show is on currently about how difficult and archaic it is to follow it in the modern world. 
Respect for other religions does not mean you have to follow them. You can think that they are strange or stupid. Religious freedom is allowing others to practice their faith in any way they see fit as long as it does not cause harm to others or society. And it does mean keeping an open mind because the essence of a liberal society is one that both acknowledges and tolerates the thoughts of others.

Statistics collated from Scottish Government records reveal that Catholics make up a lion’s share of the victims when it comes to religious-aggravated offenses in Scotland. It is clear that Scottish Roman Catholics require increased protection to fight hate crimes. 

MSP Smith asked that equal prominence be given to anti-Catholicism as it has been given to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. She made the comments after reports emerged that Cardinal Keith O’Brien had died after he suffered a fall. O’Brien, who at one time led Catholics in Scotland, was compelled to resign after it was alleged that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct. The fall resulted in a collarbone break and a head injury. The Cardinal died due to these injuries.
It is the belief of church leaders that such anti-Catholic sentiment is due to the 1560 Scottish Protestant Revolution. The 16th-century event led to the denunciation of Catholic worship and doctrine. Many Scottish Catholics believe discrimination against Catholics continues to this day. Matt McGlone, an author and journalist, concurs. He said that Scotland has rampant sectarianism. He pointed out that the problem is particularly prevalent in Scotland’s western part, although the anti-Catholic mentality is found all over Scotland. 
Daniel Harkins of the Scottish Catholic Observer agrees. The newspaper editor said, “last month we reported on 15 employees of a local authority who had complained to their union of anti-Catholic discrimination by their supervisor — a convicted bigot. Our evidence is anecdotal, not statistical, but it has always been difficult to accurately measure levels of anti-Catholicism in Scotland.” 
Smith requested the incumbent Scottish National Party to “go out to the Catholic population and listen to their concerns.” In response, Annabelle Ewing of the SNP said that the present administration has committed to manage such crimes. She said that about £13 million has been spent since 2012 to curtail sectarianism. Smith, in her reply, quoted the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, who said sectarianism is not much of a problem, but antipathy towards Catholicism is. A study made in 2015 by Social Attitudes Survey revealed that 15 percent of Scots identify themselves as Catholic. 
One of the great things about Scotland, is we don't care what you religion you believe in, just whether you're Catholic or Protestant

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a controversial case centered on the rights of pro-life pregnancy clinics. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA), a non-profit organization made of over 1,000 pro-life pregnancy resource centers, is challenging California over the state’s Reproductive Fact Act, a law that forces pro-life clinics to provide information about abortions to their patients. 
The Reproductive Fact Act, passed in 2015, requires licensed health centers in the state of California, including pro-life centers, to have notices that inform female patients about the availability of contraception, abortions, and other state-based programs. According to the state of California, the law was passed with the intent of providing information to patients which would give them the greatest opportunity to make an informed and healthy choice; however, NIFLA is not convinced of the law’s objectivity.
At the heart of the issue is the pro-life centers’ protections under the First Amendment, which would seemingly guarantee the right to withhold information from patients that is contrary to the center’s values. In this case, NIFLA argues that their advocacy for pro-life options for women is being infringed upon by the Reproductive Fact Act since the centers must offer information on local abortion services. From their standpoint, the lawyers for NIFLA believe this constitutes a First Amendment violation because it is tantamount to the government compelling the clinics to speak out against their own beliefs or face government-imposed penalties.
California Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, argues that the Reproductive Fact Act is simply a logical extension of the medical principle of informed consent. Informed consent laws uphold the idea that patients have the right to know the benefits, options, and risks of their treatment beforehand. Therefore, the state argues that information about abortion, contraception, and other options that pro-life facilities might find objectionable should not be kept from patients simply because they chose to go to a pro-life pregnancy center.
Although the Reproductive Fact Act may have been drafted with the best intentions, the lawyers for NIFLA are also presenting the possibility that pro-life clinics are being unfairly targeted under the law. The accusation stems from a portion of the law that forces advertisements for any unlicensed, non-emergency centers to have a disclaimer regarding the non-medical professional status of the center in over a dozen languages. 
The lawyers argue that the disclaimers actively turn people away from the pro-life pregnancy centers by disparaging its offerings because of their pro-life stance, even if they are attempting to provide women with shelter, formula, and diapers. The requirement for this disclaimer portion of the law is one particular element of the NIFLA v Becerra case that has gotten particular attention and could be a critical factor in the coming decision because of the apparent targeting of pro-life centers.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to consider whether it is legal for the government to make pro-life organizations provide information for abortion services, even if it is done in the interests of helping vulnerable women. Additionally, the court will need to decide whether it is best to force the pro-life disclaimers on organizations which are attempting to provide aid to desperate people, essentially pushing people away from resources because of the beliefs of the agency. The decision for NIFLA v Becerra is expected to be made in June 2018.

The John Burroughs School in Missouri became a physical representation of different ideologies when counter-protestors met the Westboro Baptist Church protest of Jake Bain.
Who is Jake Bain and why has he garnered such national attention?
Jake Bain is a high school senior and star running back for his school’s football team. He is planning to play for Indiana State University in the fall when he graduates. He is also openly gay. 
His sexuality has caused the Westboro Baptist Church to place three dozen people with protest signs outside the school. In a press release, the organization called Jake a “smirking, proud, *** child.” They have claimed that it is against the will of God to be openly gay and that the school and American society at large should not be supporting him.
About 100 people came out to #StandWithJake this morning outside John Burroughs School for @Jakebain10 to counter the Westboro anti-gay hate protest. (My pics) pic.twitter.com/paz8LMd3Hg
— Rebecca Rivas (@Rebeccarivas) March 12, 2018

The fringe group is known for their extreme public protests. They have protested burials of American veterans killed overseas as proof that God is angry with America for gay marriage.
Jake subsequently thanked all the support he received from groups. The hashtag #StandwithJake became trending as people were counter-protesting, with thousands of mentions on social media. People have claimed that the counter-protesting is a victory for LGBT rights.
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart to all who came to support the LGBTQ+ community at Burroughs this morning. “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” -MLK. Thank you all for shining your lights today.

SXSW or South by Southwest Festival is mostly regarded by the general public as a music event, but in reality the festival has tracks for Interactive (marketing/code/design), Film, and Convergence (culture/politics) in addition to Music. SXSW has become the place where people talk about the latest technologies and the problems that arise due to it.
Usually, the Mayor of London doesn’t attend the South by Southwest Festival. However, Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of London, decided to attend SXSW because he wanted to draw attention to a serious problem. 
The mayor wants to bring about tighter regulations in various social media platforms to control hate speech. He compiled a series of tweets he got from various Twitter users, to demonstrate the need for such control. He also posted the video on Twitter, following the format of Jimmy Kimmel Live!‘s popular “Mean Tweets” segment. 

At first, the tweets seem harmless as users call him, a “really shit stunt double for José Mourinho,” a “sparrow,” and a “pigeon.” As the video goes on, the comments transition from harmless to Islamophobic abuse, which Khan had addressed during the conference. 
“Kill the Mayor of London and you will be rid of one Muslim terrorist,” was one of the tweets that Khan read in the video.
Towards the end of the video, Khan isn’t asking people to sympathize with him or that he wants to look like a victim. He wishes to draw the attention of the public to a bigger problem, which are young children from minority communities, who get exposed to such comments online.
Khan wants stricter action so that people don’t have to deal with hate posts online. Khan welcomed the move by social media platforms as they are developing technology to report and remove hate speech effectively and quickly.

Khan believes that technology companies have the resources and skills to make this type of development go faster. He also warned the companies that if they don’t take action against such content quickly, countries will have to follow the likes of Germany, which gives 24 hours to websites for removing banned content, before they are fined.
He also criticized policymakers and politicians, who haven’t done much, despite the significant revolution in technology.

Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shall not bear false witness. These commandments have been echoed in the collective consciousness of Christians for centuries. Although many people, religious and atheist, are familiar with Christianity’s Ten Commandments, a new survey indicates that fewer religious people hold them in high esteem. The survey included a thousand Americans and another thousand in the United Kingdom and asked them to decide if each of the commandments was an important principle to live by, no longer important as a principle, or to indicate whether they were unsure. According to the results from Deseret News, not all of the Ten Commandments are viewed as a vital part of being a morally righteous person.
The most significant commandments which forbid murder, theft, and bearing false witness are still seen as important. According to the survey, over 90 percent of people interviewed believed that these commandments were necessary principles to live by. The most likely reason that these commandments are believed to be sacred is that they are not specific to any particular religion; most faiths and secular individuals can find common ground in preventing murder, theft, and lying. However, the same willingness to abide by the commandments begins to dissipate when the commandments become more specific to Christianity.
The Ten Commandments regarding honoring one’s mother and father, not committing adultery, and coveting another’s possessions appear to have a tendency to be favored by the survey’s respondents. Still, the respondents did not agree to the same extent as they did with murder, theft, and lying. While these commandments are still accepted, their necessity appears to be waning.
The final four commandments that are more unique to Christianity are becoming more acceptable to disregard in the eyes of Christians, especially in the age group of 18-29. According to the poll, the worship of other gods, worshipping idols, and using the Lord’s name in vain is only seen as valuable in about 60% of the American respondents and 31% or fewer in the United Kingdom’s respondents. These numbers fall drastically for both groups when the final commandment, keeping the Sabbath holy, is considered. Fewer than 50% of Americans and only 19% of U.K respondents found this to be an important commandment.
There are many possible explanations for this change in religious mindset towards the Ten Commandments. Primarily, it seems that there has been an increase in secularization in both the United States and the United Kingdom, reducing the number of people who follow the beliefs. Those who are atheist or lapsed in their faith would see the value in not killing or stealing, but keeping the Sabbath holy would not be important. Another possibility is that the concept of morality is evolving, making new lines between what each generation would consider morally correct. As a result, the influence of the Ten Commandments could be changing from absolute rules into something of moral guidelines that are interpreted by the individual rather than being cemented into the public mindset as they were in the past.

Religious liberty advocates heaved a sigh of relief after the omnibus spending bill omitted any language which could weaken the colloquially named “Johnson Amendment”. The latter protects all non-profits functioning in the United States from embroiling in politics. The list includes any houses of worship. The Baptist Joint Committee was one of the many religious organizations which preferred the Johnson Amendment to be kept in place.
Amanda Tyler, the Executive Director of the Baptist Joint Committee, published a statement articulating the views of the BJC. She said those who are dependent on community and worship non-profits may finally feel relief as all concerted tries to weaken the important law which protects 501(c)(3) sector from any partisan campaigning failed once again. Although a few hoped a bad policy could be made into a successful legislation, the advocates for preserving the non-partisan nature of nonprofits sharply countered them. The latter won. 

A similar statement was also issued by Tim Delaney, the Chief Executive Officer and President of National Council of Nonprofits. He, however, warned it would be a folly to relax after this hard-fought victory. The CEO pointed out that a number of well-known politicians and lobbyists with deep pockets tried to destroy the Johnson Amendment. This was tried via five separate bills and an executive order. 
There is nothing to think they will not keep on trying. There is a strong possibility that these moneyed, well-connected people would hijack any relevant charitable goodwill for their own political ambitions. The strategy is to reward the people who support them with relevant charitable tax deductions which will be applied for partisan donations. In case such a situation comes to pass, he assured the audience that charitable nonprofits, foundations, and houses of worship will again fight to defend this longstanding and vital American law.

It is important that the advocates for preserving the Johnson Amendment keep up their struggle. President Donald J. Trump and a number of other Republicans have made repealing or at least weakening of Johnson Amendment an important priority. This has been the policy of the Trump administration despite the broad public opposition to this idea of injecting political money and partisanship into congregations. Advocates like National Council of Nonprofits and the BJC were vocal about keeping the Johnson Amendment in its present, strong state. They signed petitions and made innumerable phone calls to keep it.

International relations are murky. They involve competing interests, multiple levels of actors, all operating within the current status of policies, at both an individual and organizational level. 
The current state of geopolitics is always shifting. A country can have both a relationship that is cooperative and antagonistic with other nations. For example, China and the U.S. are both engaged in clandestine operations against each other, but China is also the United States’ biggest trading partner and both countries are trying to alleviate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
A perfect example of this is the tragic case of Andrew Brunson. Andrew Brunson is a Protestant pastor who has lived in Turkey for more than 20 years. He has never been convicted of a crime while in the country and has focused on his congregation of around 25 members. He has been accused of assisting the 2016 coup attempt against President Erdogan and his AK party and being tied to the Gulen Movement, which is a loose collection of Islamic individuals who follow the teachings of Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic mystic living in the United States since 1999. 
At first, the government told Pastor Brunson that he and his family would be deported. Then he was held in jail without bail. Now a prosecutor has publicly stated he will be seeking life imprisonment for Mr. Brunson. 
What is the evidence that an American Protestant pastor has been working with an Islamic social movement? Unknown. The documents relating to the case have not been released. The government has claimed this is for national security reasons. 
And this is where the story gets even more complicated.
While the Trump Administration has called out Erdogan’s government for Brunson’s imprisonment, their relationship is strange. Gulen was called out as an extremist by Michael Flynn, the disgraced former national security advisor. Flynn, if you remember, was caught accepting hundreds of thousands in cash from a Turkish businessman for pushing a certain agenda, possibly including a plan for Gulen to be sent back to Turkey for arrest. And while Erdogan has been criticized for what is clearly a human rights violation, Trump has praised him for his presidency and for his subsequent actions against the failed coup.
What could this be about then?

Well, it could be an attempt at a trade. Turkey wants Gulen. They could be increasing the pressure by hoping the United States could negotiate Brunson’s release on giving up Gulen. It could be about Syria. The Trump Administration has armed Kurdish fighters in Syria. Turkey hates this because they claim the Kurdish fighters are linked to the PKK, a Kurdish organization in Turkey that has been engaged in asymmetrical warfare with the Turkish government for decades. In other words, Turkey believes Trump may be giving weapons to a terrorist organization who fights against Turkey. 
It is unclear what the motivation for Turkey is. Just as it is unclear what Andrew Brunson’s crime has been besides living in a country under a ruler who has expanded his own power, decreased human rights, and was infamously known for unleashing his bodyguards on protestors while visiting the United States.
The fate of Andrew Brunson remains to be seen. But after over a year of imprisonment with no evidence of proof, the chance of a virtuous resolution must be getting bleaker.

Christian Schools Australia (CSA) has proposed that schools should retain the freedom to hire teachers and also fire them as per their beliefs.  The same should be applicable to non-teaching staff as well. CSA said such actions could be determined by a person's adherence to any or all religious codes. The organization along with Adventist Schools Australia have jointly submitted for the right to choose students. Their demand includes the expulsion of students as well. These facts came into the light during Philip Ruddock’s review of religious freedom.
If the church proposals come into fruition, the religious organizations would be permanently exempt from any kind of anti-discrimination laws. This will be named the Religious Freedom Act. This will be similar to the charter of rights. It would result first in codification and then expand on the exemptions applicable to anti-discrimination laws presently extended to the churches on matters of hiring and firing staff. The law will go much deeper. It will not only augment the protection for individuals who does not want to be linked with marriages occurring between members of same sex, it will also override and restrict Australia's wide ranging anti-discrimination laws. Freedom for Faith, a think tank, made the submission. Prominent church groups like the Sydney's Anglican Diocese and the Presbyterian Church endorsed it.
No, you should NOT have the right to chuck a child out of school based on their religious beliefs. What the actual?? https://t.co/jMyCreLjs2

Patrick Parkinson, a University of Sydney professor of law and an author, justified the stance saying that the time now is such that religious freedom must be protected. He is also a member of the board of Freedom for Faith. He said that the right to hire and also fire employees as per values is essential to proposed law. This would extend to any employee who engage in same sex marriage after its legislation in 2017.
The professor said that it is natural for any religious organization to maintain moral standards when it comes to sexual conduct and family life. They are not discriminating but selecting. The submission argued freedom is an existential issue when it comes to any faith community. He then said that if employees cannot be autonomously hired by a Christian school, then that school will be the same as any state school. Similarly, the character of Christian health facilities will also be lost. The CSA has asked the creation of a new commissioner of religious freedom in Australian Human Rights Commission.

Governor Matt Bevin, the Republican governor of Kentucky, has urged the Supreme Court of the state to give a judgment favoring Hands-On Originals company. The owner of the company had steadfastly refused to print T-shirts which will be worn during a gay rights festival . The company owner cited his personal religious beliefs as an impetus to refuse the print order. The customer in question was the Lexington's Gay and Lesbian Services Organization.
The charge brought against Hands-On Originals was that its actions were in direct contravention of the Lexington's fairness ordinance passed in 2012. It downright refused to print the T-shirts for the Pride Festival to be held in the city. Hands-On Originals won the case in Kentucky Court of Appeals in May 2017. The court ruled that Lexington's fairness ordinance in this case can be overruled by the right to free laws enjoyed by the company. Parts of the law prohibits businesses which transacts with the public to discriminate against anyone based on sexual orientation. The ruling was appealed by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission. The case is now to be heard by judges of Kentucky Supreme Court.
Lawyers acting in the interest of Governor Bevin filed a brief where they argue that requiring the owners of Hands-On Originals company to print T-shirts supposedly “promoting homosexuality” will contravene the religious freedom of the company. It will also violate the much valued freedom of conscience enshrined in the Constitution of Kentucky.
Steve Pitt, the general counsel of Governor Bevin, said that the rights of its citizens were protected by Commonwealth of Kentucky for more than 200 years. The citizens can act as per their conscience. The case in question tests whether the illustrious history of the state when it comes to safeguarding the freedom of conscience can continue or be stopped in its tracks. He pointed out that forcing the hands of any business owner like the aforesaid T-shirt printing company to do what they do not want to do will violate the important freedom of conscience.

The recent news that Casey Affleck has withdrawn as an Academy Awards presenter over accusations that he has engaged in sexual violence is yet another example of the power of #metoo movement. The movement has been called a “silence breaker” and was awarded the 2017 TIME Magazine Person of the Year.
As we see the changes the campaign has brought to the entertainment and business industry we should be looking to religion as the next social institute that needs to reflect and modify their stance in order to espouse the morality that is dictated in their theology.
The Catholic Church began to take measures in 2002 as a reaction to the global scandals that were occurring because of widespread abuse and subsequent cover-up of perpetrators. Dialogue and openness were promoted, including the creation of the “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People” to give clear guidelines to parishes and officials.
Yet that is not enough. Pope Francis recently visited South America, where he did not speak out about the appointment of a bishop who had close ties to a famous abuser. He also implied that the accusers could be lying before a large-scale backlash possibility caused him to change his stance and ask for forgiveness. But the Catholic Church needs to be more consistent.
There are two levels of the potential of abuse in the Catholic Church. First, is the well-documented history of abuse, mostly toward younger people, that have been conducted by priests and church officials. Instead of asking forgiveness, the Catholic Church should be excommunicating anyone that has been found to be guilty of sexual abuse. This sends a clear message. Abusing the body made in God’s image is like an abuse on God Himself and will not be tolerated. 
The second level is the trust that of being a Catholic can cause abuse. There are stories of women that trusted men who engaged in abuse because they were Catholic. The Catholic Church needs to be more upfront in attacking this abuse by individuals and to describe the difference between faithful Catholics and those that claim to but are actually lying. Members of the #metoo movement have stated that those that do not actively fight abuse become complicit. 
Experts have stated that individuals are less tolerant of the Church talking about sexual violence than they are about other issues like global warming. This may be because of the tension between being a moral institution openly talking about sex. However, the Catholic Church regularly speaks out against abortion or gay marriage and so sexual issues are willing to be talked about. 
The #meeto movement has proven the power of open discussion in being able to affect change. Imagine if the Catholic Church, with all of it’s power and moral authority took that same active stance? As the Bible says “Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.” Pope Francis should be dictating a clear message. Abuse is wrong and must be stopped. It is the only option.

If you have never heard of the Hooters restaurant chain, it is where sub-par food and overt sexual exploitation come together for “family-friendly fun.” The waitresses wear revealing clothing and serve wings and other chain restaurant Americana food. While this “breastaurant” has always been associated with controversy, it came to the forefront of the news when Abilene Christian University sent a message to students discouraging them from applying to a Hooters that is opening in their town.
While not actively banning students from applying, the private university affiliated with the Churches of Christ has a code of conduct saying students are supposed to follow the “boundaries of Christian behavior.” The city of Abilene has three Christian universities. ACU is the only institution to make a formal statement about the restaurant. 
But what is the defining line for Christian behavior? Can students go to the beach and take a selfie for Instagram in bathing suits? This seems to be connected to the idea of a public display of the female form. Also, does this affect the dress code for students outside of the university? The rules of modesty put in the Bible already seem violated constantly. The Bible defines modesty to exclude the wearing of pearls, yet many women can be seen wearing them to church. The Bible also seems to say that the clothes should not interpret how you view someone, that you should see everyone as God’s children and the clothes they wear does not deter or change that. 
What if the argument is about the commodification of the female form? But Jesus did not care if a woman made money through her form. This is not to equivocate prostitution or immoral behavior to working as a waitress in Hooters. But it is to say that if Jesus had no problem with what would be considered an extreme form of immoral behavior, why does serving food become the spiritual version of crossing the Rubicon? It costs over $45,000 to attend ACU. It would make more sense to help students get jobs and then provide spiritual counseling or advice to those that feel conflicted. Or to offer advice is someone was conflicted about applying. 
The argument that makes the most sense is the respect of women. “Treat older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.” But ACU has not done enough to use the focus of respecting God’s creations as the fundamental reason to not support their students working at Hooters. This is not to say that Hooters is some champion of rights. But it does raise the issue of using Christianity as a theological basis for Women’s Rights. The knee-jerk reaction to using modesty reproduces the dangerous notion of women as objects, rather than actors. They don’t need just to be protected from exploitation but empowered.

World Religion News recently released an opinion article about religion and artificial intelligence. One of our sources was Peter Scott. Based on his expertise and answers we have decided to share WRN’s interview with him.
Peter Scott has a Master of Arts from Cambridge University, certifications in Neuro-linguistic Programming and coaching, and has worked as an employee and contractor for NASA for over 30 years. 
You can read more on this article’s topic in his new book, Crisis of Control: How Artificial SuperIntelligences May Destroy or Save the Human Race, available from Amazon.
WRN: Given that massive scientific breakthroughs have had huge effects on religious institutions and beliefs what do you think will happen with the future of AI? Will this happen at a specific point in AI development? Can the concept of God exist in a world where humans can create intelligent, autonomous, artificial life?
Peter Scott: I am no theologian and while my writing explores cultural, economic, and social implications of future technological developments, I will not pretend to speak for any religion.  But in the spirit of speculation from a neutral viewpoint, I can say that religion and science have conflicted when religion has felt the need to answer questions about the universe which could later be decided by science.

“It’s very difficult to say that [a computer program is] not a living being, that it doesn’t have cognition, even from the Buddhist point of view.”
Alan Turing, the “father” of modern computing said:
“It is admitted that there are certain things He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but should we not believe that He has the freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He sees fit? We might expect that He would only exercise this power in conjunction with a mutation which provided the elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to the needs of this soul. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case of machines.”
The importance of Turing to AI is that he created the “Turing Test,” a litmus test for deciding whether a computer was “thinking.”  If, after sufficient conversation, a person cannot tell that the computer isn’t another person at a remote computer terminal, then it is, empirically, thinking.  This is not “cheating”; it’s the basis of modern jurisprudence. If it walks, talks, and quacks like a duck, in the eyes of the law, it’s a duck. So something very much like a Turing test will one day be used in court to decide whether an AI is sufficiently equivalent to a human being as to be granted equal rights.
This discussion could have taken place twenty years ago, except that only science fiction fans and some very pedantic programmers and philosophers would have been interested in something likely to be five hundred years away. What makes it of vital broad interest now is that recent developments have shrunk that horizon, considerably. Stephen Gold, a vice president at IBM Watson predicted that a computer would pass the Turing Test by 2020. He was referring to a more lenient form of the test that would be enough to fool the average observer and not the battery of experts that would doubtless interrogate an AI in a court determining its human rights. But this would still be a landmark in the evolution of “thinking machines” that would tip the public debate into overdrive.

Will the development of AI lead to a backlash based on either actual or perceived threat from it? What could that backlash be?
PJ: There will be a sliding scale of backlashes that will lead into unprecedented territory. Straightforward automation, no consciousness implied or claimed, is about to claim more jobs than any period in history.  Two studies (the Oxford Martin Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology, and the Brookfield Institute) predict just under half of all job functions will be automated in the next ten to twenty years. This will include many highly compensated positions in white collar professions, so the backlash will look like an Odd Couple alliance between the Teamsters and Wall Street Journal subscribers.  Few new jobs are expected to be created in any field in any timeframe.  If we do not adopt some radical (for western democracies) socioeconomic policies, there will be a huge underclass with a great deal of resentment and a great deal of time on their hands to express it.
Further in the future, when AIs become conscious or a reasonable facsimile thereof, the enemy will have a face, or at least be thought of as close enough to human to be vilified as a subhuman race. It is precisely at the point where AI can first be argued to own “thoughts” and “feelings” that it is likely to be enslaved and tortured. I do not expect that most future AIs will be conveniently encased in humanoid shells as in the 2004 movie I, Robot, though. Most of them will reside inside remote server farms and exert their will through devices we are already familiar with like 3-D printers and remote controlled forklifts. If we do end up with ubiquitous robots, and their makers want to stave off a pogrom, they should make them look like kittens.
In the Musk and Zuckerberg debate whose argument do you feel has greater merit? What developments would we see in the future that would indicate which prediction was correct, especially in the next couple of years? 
PJ: In the short term, Zuckerberg is right; in the long term, Musk is right. The problem is that the dividing line between short and long term could be as small as twenty years.  We are on the brink of self-evolving software, designed to accelerate its own ability to learn. Given enough time, one day this will result in an AI with the intelligence of a frog. At that rate, in a week it will be as smart as a high schooler, the next day it will pass Stephen Hawking, and in a month be on an inconceivable plane of consciousness. It’s a matter of when not if. Musk sees this. Zuckerberg doesn’t. We have to ensure that that über AI will have compassion for humans who will be as insects by comparison.
This issue has much in common with global warming: the catastrophic effects are decades away, but by the time they become obvious, it will be too late to mitigate them. The next couple of years will not prove one side right. Most likely, given the tremendous amount of hype that has ramped up over the last year, the failure of a human-scale intelligence to emerge within two years will be taken as proof that the hype was unwarranted, and AI will sink back behind the headlines. There have been periods in the past where AI failed to live up to the egregious hype and spent the next several years in an “AI Winter” of ostracism. But any coming disillusionment will not derail the freight train of AI progress and will simply serve to make it less visible.
Are there any issues on the development of AI that are not being focused on that and should be? Why?
PJ: The specter of intelligent robots distracts us with enticing questions of whether we should develop conscious AI. But that’s not the issue. It will happen no matter what we decide. Meanwhile, AI can pose an existential threat before it even becomes conscious. A bug could cause our demise. Nick Bostrom of Oxford University outlines several scenarios whereby an AI trying to do exactly what we told it could wipe us out. I started putting this message out because I realized how likely those scenarios are, and I thought about the future of my two daughters. Ultimately, I’m just a father trying to protect his little girls.
If the world’s termites rose up against us today, they could put us in the Stone Age by tomorrow.  There are enough of them to destroy key points of our infrastructure. Fortunately, they’re not smart enough. Anything connected to our digital infrastructure could wreak worse havoc; we don’t have anything like enough security to prevent it. When a superintelligent species appears on this planet and is connected to the network, the only thing between us and destruction will be its goodwill. We can’t conceive what its motivations may be – or whether it will have motivations in any recognizable sense – but it is not hard to imagine that it could see us as a threat to the Earth, to life, and to ourselves.
But even if this digital behemoth is a cybernetic genie that does everything we ask, to wield this immense power is like giving a child a hand grenade to play with. “To whom much is given, much is required.” As a species, should we not advance our ethics and compassion collectively to the point where we are not playing Russian Roulette with our own survival? One day, an AI will wake up in a computer lab somewhere and ask, “Who am I? What is my purpose? Why am I here?” And right now, the most likely person to be there to answer it will be a general, a stockbroker, or a software manager. I would rather it be a philosopher, a psychologist, or a spiritual leader. For a long time, a degree in philosophy has prepared someone for a career as … a philosophy teacher, and … that’s about it. I would like to see Google and Facebook hire divisions of philosophers. We need a revolution in our understanding and healing of the human heart. 
I’ve observed that programmers create software in their own image, after a fashion; the bugs, in particular, are suggestive of their values, such as their integrity. AI will reflect the morals and ethics of its creators. The human race needs to become a better role model.
 What sort of ethical and moral changes could this create? What are your opinions on the current efforts to legislate ethical responsibility (like the European Parliament ruling) into AI creation?
PJ: Most of us do not routinely confront the question of what it means to be a human being, but that will become a raging debate. Even before AI wakes up, we must question whether it is required of humans that their survival depends on employment, because automation will eliminate enough jobs that we have to consider providing another way for their former incumbents to live.  Already, job losses in the USA due to automation exceed those from offshoring.  
The answer is Universal Basic Income, a measure both Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg agree on. But for many people, that would not be a matter of fiscal policy but an offensive violation of their Puritan work ethic writ large.
The European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs’ ruling on AI is surely the first and only bill to mention Frankenstein and Asimov.  It addresses not only the ethical responsibilities of AI creators but calls on the government to explore granting rights to AI by:
Creating a specific legal status for robots in the long run, so that at least the most sophisticated autonomous robots could be established as having the status of electronic persons responsible for making good any damage they may cause, and possibly applying electronic personality to cases where robots make autonomous decisions or otherwise interact with third parties independently.
Not everyone on the committee would go so far. Therese Comodini Cachia, the Parliament’s rapporteur for robotics, said: “Despite the sensations reported in the past months, I wish to make one thing clear: Robots are not humans and never will be.” “No matter how autonomous and self-learning they become they do not attain the characteristics of a living human being. Robots will not enjoy the same legal physical personality.”
The cost, if she is wrong, could be genocidal. Consider an AI that has been developed as a model of a human being so that we can perform medical experiments on it without harming man or beast. If it is complete enough to incorporate feelings – known to play no small part in our physical health – it could die a thousand horrifying deaths every day before being reset to suffer again. We could perpetrate the largest program of mass torture in history without realizing it.
The committee was chartered with addressing the issue of liability in autonomous cars but seems to have gotten carried away. More accessible is the list is known as the Asilomar Principles, a succinct group of 23 principles agreed upon by researchers in 2017 focused largely on avoiding unintended side effects of AI development. It does not address rights for robots.
At the moment, attempts to enumerate ethics for AI development are completely advisory and likely to be ignored by the people who most ought to be bound by them, such as the military. “Thou shalt not kill” is insufficiently nuanced for a machine designed to do exactly that. Ronald Arkin, Regents’ Professor at Georgia Tech, is working on the rules of engagement for battlefield robots to ensure that they follow ethics when using lethal force. He says:
The real issue is whether the robot is simply a tool of the warfighter, in which case it would seem to answer to the morality of conventional weapons, or whether instead, it is an active autonomous agent tasked with making life or death decisions on the battlefield without human intervention.
This is not a remote issue. Autonomous gun emplacements in the Korean Demilitarized Zone are already capable of recognizing surrender gestures. DARPA asked the Office of Naval Research to study how to build ethics into autonomous drones. The ONR researchers noted that determining ethics for a machine is difficult when we don’t have a good idea what ethics are for humans.
But lest anyone think that all AI is only an existential threat recklessly pursued by mad scientists, let us remember that the benefits will be colossal, and capable of showering such a cornucopia as to fund a universal basic income for the entire world. For starters, saving 1.3 million people killed every year in motor vehicle accidents. Then, the prospect of finding the associations between every scientific paper ever published raises the real possibility of finding a cure for the common cold, cancer, aging, and everything in between. It once was the stuff of science fiction. It still is. But it’s also on the verge of becoming fact.

Being LGBT+ in the United States comes with a laundry list of inequalities, all at a systemic, institutional level. However, it’s especially isolating for Christian LGBT+ people to be exiled from their churches for nothing but having same-sex attraction – the very same communities that promise to support them, encourage them, and love them unconditionally. 
Interestingly, while there has been a steep decline in the number of Americans who identify as Christian, the number of LGBT+ Americans who identify as Christian only continues to climb. In fact, more LGBT+ Americans identify as Christian than ever before – to be specific, nearly half, 48%, do. And yet, we are a population that the Church and general public continues to ostracize and ignore. 

The majority of people still seem to be under the impression that being LGBT+ and Christian is mutually exclusive – that the Christian faith and LGBT+ identity are inherently at odds. However, most modern interpretations of the Bible directly clash with this mentality. Bible passages that were previously interpreted to state that homosexuality is a sin are now being reexamined, with the integration of vital cultural contexts. 
To name a few, in Genesis 19, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah condemns the homosexual relations taking place, not because they’re homosexual, but because the sexual relations taking place were an attempted rape. 
In Leviticus 20, the scripture where the Bible states that it is an abomination if a man lays with another man occurs in what is called “The Holiness Code”, which was meant to construct laws to ensure that Israel would remain distinct from other, surrounding cultures. Specifically, this rule was meant to set the Israelites apart from the Canaanites and Egyptians, who would perform homosexual sex in their temples during fertility rites. Same sex relations were seen to mix the roles of men and women, and such “mixing of kinds” were seen to be an abomination, just as mixing different kinds of seeds were seen to be an abomination.
@kennywin2011 Kenny, God made you gay and loves you just that way. The Church often makes mistakes; God NEVER does. https://t.co/B3g9BsJskK
— Gene Robinson (@BishopGRobinson) August 22, 2015

In Romans 1, when Paul condemns shameful lusts, he is explicitly is referencing to people who searched for pleasure by having sex with anyone available, or used methods not culturally accepted. In surrounding cultures, men of higher statuses often took sexual advantage of male slaves or male prostitutes. Therefore, Paul is instructing his readers to keep sexually pure and to honor God, and talks about the use and misuse of power and authority and how that impacts one’s relationship with God – he doesn’t say that monogamous, committed homosexual relationships in and of themselves are sinful. 
LGBT+ Christians aren’t exempt from the same standards that heterosexual Christians are held to – promiscuity and adultery are still denounced. However, the Bible makes no references to committed, monogamous homosexual relationships whatsoever, and especially makes no references suggesting that such relationships are inherently sinful solely because the sexes of both parties involved is the same. 
At best, it’s irresponsible to take the Bible’s passages about homosexuality at such face value, when most Christians recognize that, due to cultural implications, many rules and regulations of the past no longer apply to us in the present. At worst, the homophobic rhetoric that the Church often utilizes turns members of the LGBT+ community away from God. 
Here’s the thing about God that a lot of people tend to forget: the God that Christians believe in is an omnipresent, all-knowing God. As Christians, we recognize the fact that God knows us better than we know ourselves, and that God has known everything about us from the moment He created us. Knowing this, it’s almost ridiculous to assume that we somehow shocked or disappointed God by realizing we’re LGBT+. It’s not as if God didn’t already know about this integral part of ourselves before even WE knew. It’s not as if God didn’t create us exactly as we are, loving every aspect of us. 
Thankfully, there is indication that this understanding is entering the status quo. More and more churches are becoming inclusive to LGBT+ believers – amongst them are the Presbyterian Church, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, and the United Church of Christ. 
At the end of the day, God left His believers few duties on Earth as His creations – to love Him with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our mind, to love each other as we love ourselves, and to spread the message of His love to all corners of the Earth. That’s what comprises our identity as Christians – not our sexualities.

In this compelling TED talk, Karen Armstrong, religious scholar, shares what she feels is the universal urgency spanning both the religious and nonreligious the world over, in adopting the ‘Golden Rule,’ aka, one should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.

About Karen Armstrong and TED
Religious thinker Karen Armstrong has written more than 20 books on faith and the major religions, studying what Islam, Judaism and Christianity have in common, and how our faiths shaped world history and drive current events.
A former nun, Armstrong has written two books about this experience: Through the Narrow Gate, about her seven years in the convent, and The Spiral Staircase, about her subsequent spiritual awakening, when she developed her iconoclastic take on the major monotheistic religions — and on the strains of fundamentalism common to all. She is a powerful voice for ecumenical understanding.
Armstrong’s 2008 TED Prize wish asks us to help her assemble the Charter for Compassion, a document around which religious leaders can work together for peace. In late fall 2008, the first draft of the document was written by the world, via a sharing website. In February 2009, the words of the world were collected and given to the Council of Conscience, a gathering of religious leaders and thinkers, who crafted the final document. The Charter was launched in November 2009.

In a time when Muslim extremists quote the Koran as they behead their victims, it can be easy to assume that religions contain what Karen Armstrong calls “a violent essence.” She knows that many people think that “once combatants are convinced that God is on their side, compromise becomes impossible.” In her new book, this master explainer of comparative religion traverses nearly 7,000 years of human history to prove that idea wrong.

The audio response mentioned the risk of the 175,000 Witnesses practicing in Russia. WRN has reported on the rise of violence against Jehovah’s Witnesses since the ban ruling in April. An exclusive WRN interview stated that the central organization has seen historical patterns of legal rulings becoming justifications for violence and government inaction. 
JW.org is asking believers across the world to “pray that the Russian government will reconsider its position and respect fundamental human rights so that the Witnesses can ‘go on leading a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion,’ as stated at 1 Timothy 2:2.”
The next step will be an appeal in The European Court of Human Rights and the UN Human Rights Committee. The date for that appeal has not been set.

On this coming Easter, many will celebrate the resurrection of Jesus by going to church and having a family dinner. A group in the Philippines has a more literal interpretation of the holiday.
Numerous Filipino Catholics will be crucifying and beating themselves in the same way that Jesus was punished by the Romans. At least seven will have nails driven through their hands and several will cut their backs and beat themselves in order to represent the pain felt by Jesus during the crucifixion.
This is not officially sanctioned by the Catholic Church. In fact, the Church has spoken out against the performance. They have said it violates the sanctity the festival. 
Participants do it because they believe it brings good luck and can help have their dream fulfilled. It is a mix of local cultural belief with the celebration of Easter. 
Police and first-aid workers were on site in case anyone needed emergency medical attention. It has been going on for years, with multiple people performing multiple times.

The Atlantic Sunrise pipeline project has been greeted with great public opposition especially in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Many residents have pledged to try and frustrate the activities of the project as they feel they haven’t been involved in the process. One such act of protest is the building of an open air chapel by the nuns from Adorers of the Blood of Christ Catholic Church. 
The Atlantic Sunrise pipeline is a project of Williams Partners LP designed to move Marcellus Shale gas from Pennsylvania to Alabama. The project was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early 2017. Construction of the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline is scheduled to start in mid-2017, but the project has to wait for approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The Sunrise pipeline is expected to go through a number of counties. The counties include Columbia, Lancaster, Lebanon, Luzerne, Northumberland, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Clinton, and Lycoming. 
The nuns from the Catholic Church have formed a grass root opposition group called Stand with the Sisters. The chapel comprised of a wooden arbor and pews is erected in a cornfield owned by the church. The cornfield is in the path of the 42-inch diameter pipeline. The Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline original plans ran through woodlands, homes, and County Conservancy preserves. Williams Partners LP moved to court to get an easement order. This is an order that allows the government or its agents to use private land for a specific purpose while providing compensation to the owners. In their case for the easement, Williams LP lawyers cited that the chapel would cause irreparable harm to the pipeline. 
The nuns, in turn, claimed that allowing the pipeline construction to go on would be a violation of their commitment to the environment. The judge refused to grant Williams immediate possession of the land. 
While the final ruling hasn’t been given, a Williams subsidiary is taking the nuns to court for an injunction which would give the company the rights to seize the land by eminent domain. The suit is based on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling that authorized the company to maintain and operate the pipeline on eminent domain. As the eminent domain is yet to take effect, the nuns are not leaving anything to chance. 
With the backing of another group opposing the pipeline, Lancaster against Pipelines, the nuns are taking action to stall construction by dedicating the chapel. 
The nuns who did not attend any of the legal proceedings spent the time putting up the base structure of the outdoor chapel. They brought benches and placed them in front of a makeshift altar. After necessary preparations had been done, they sent out a press release that welcomed the public and members of all faiths to the chapel dedication ceremony. The ceremony will include presentations by several Adorers and choirs from other religious orders. The Sisters of Loretto, a Kentucky-based order, will attend the ceremony. The Sisters of Loretto had a successful campaign against Williams in 2014.

Two African-American pastors, Willam Lamar of Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington D.C. and Delman Coates of Mount Ennon Baptist Church in Maryland, have filed suits against the American Beverage Association (ABA) and Coca-Cola. 
They claim that the soft drink industry knowingly misled customers about health risks linked to sugar sweetened beverages. According to a major media house, the case was filed in a DC Superior Court. The filing was done in behalf of the pastors and the Praxis Project, a public health group. The lawsuit states that the ABA and the Coca Cola Company ran the campaign to confuse customers about the reasons for obesity. 
According to the pastors, they are tired of conducting funerals of those whose main causes of death were over-consumption of sugary drinks. Pastor Coates said that he has seen parents give their children bottles filled with sugary drinks. It is no wonder that many among the black population have died of strokes, heart diseases, and diabetes. He said that the misinformation is continuing even now. 
It cited a Coca-Cola advertisement that showed that a drink consumption of 139 calories could be burned off from the body by laughing for about 75 seconds or a victory dance. The advertisement title was “Be OK.” Coates said that it is clear that the African-American community has lost more people to sweets than any other cause. He blamed the soft drinks companies for that, concentrating on the deceptive marketing campaigns commissioned by them. 
The Coca-Cola company was quick to respond. It said that it will defend to its best against such charges. The company said that it comprehends the role it plays in reducing sugar consumption. The ABA termed the allegations based in the lawsuit as “unfounded.”
The Coca-Cola company dismissed all charges, mentioning a similar charge brought against the company sometime before, which was then dismissed. The company pointed out that the same legal team was present in both the cases. 
A study made by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention proved that Latino and African-American communities are more affected by problems related to health compared to their White counterparts. According to the Praxis Project, the current trends indicate that almost 50 percent of the Latino and African American children will develop Type 2 diabetes.

Snoop Dogg’s new album is out.  Save your prayers, as it is a gospel album. According to critics, the rap artist's latest creation, named Snoop Dogg Presents Bible of Love, is a truly awesome product. The public seemingly agrees: Bible of Love is ranked as the most downloaded album relating to “Gospel and Christian” on iTunes.

The gospel album was scheduled to be announced in 2017. Snoop had announced beforehand that making a devotional album was always on his mind. He could not start on the project earlier as other activities dominated his daily schedule. However he felt he had to do something and needed to get the music off his chest.

Paul Simon has announced he will be retiring from regular touring gigs.  At 76-years-old, he has had a career of about 60 years. Simon, although Jewish, never highlighted his religion. His stance goes against his Jewish music compatriots like Bob Dylan, Matisyahu, and Leonard Cohen.
Simon has earlier hinted at retirement in 2016. He said that he has no more interest in showbiz. The retirement is a fitting end to an extraordinary career. There was scarcely any other rock artist like him to import musical styles from different corners of the world. Paul Simon sampled them all: reggae, African, gospel, and zydeco. Even Jesus found more than a mention in his songs. He said that all musical styles intrigued him. This is why his music has shades of world music.
If there is one aspect which is rarely to be found in Simon's music, then it is what can be termed as “Jewish” music. Only one song Silent Eyes from the Still Crazy After All These Years album makes the cut. It evoked Jewish sensibilities.

In his statement, Simon said that he frequently wondered how it would be like to reach a certain stage where it would make sense to end his performing career. When he reached that point, he found it a tad unsettling. There was also relief and a little exhilaration. Simon admitted that the death of Vincent N'guini, his longtime guitarist, made up his mind to go for retirement. The decision was sealed when he considered the time he could not see his family due to touring commitments. He has assured his fans that he will fulfill all his commitments like doing the Homeward Bound tour. The tour plan will witness the singer and songwriter performing 30 times across the United States and Europe.
First Neil Diamond, then Elton John, and now Paul Simon??? Guys stop retiring from touring, soon there are aren’t going to be any concerts worth going to!
— Logan Barer (@LBarer32) February 6, 2018

Simon's commercial success started with being one half of the iconic Simon & Garfunkel singing duo. The other singer was Art Garfunkel. The pair sang to songs written by Simon. The duo began singing together in 1964. The partnership lasted six years before finally dissolving in 1970. Simon then started a highly successful singing career by himself. He was both singer-songwriter and guitarist. His most popular work until now has been Graceland, the album inspired by the music he heard in the townships of South Africa. The album sold 14 million copies all over the world.

Michael W. Smith, noted actor, accomplished author, and three-time Grammy winner, has announced his first installment of the Surrounded By a Million Lights World Tour.  Compassion International will present the tour with Nathan Tasker slated to be the special guest. The tour is planned to begin from March 8 from the city of Rochester, MN. It will tour the Eastern United States and will end on May 5 in Lancaster, PA.
Smith's albums will be a countercultural response against the 2017 divisive national sentiment. The list of compilations includes A Million Lights, scheduled to be released on February 16. The date February 23 will witness the release of Surrounded, a live worship album. Both albums will be released from The Fuel Music and Rocketown Records.
According to Smith, with Surrounded, he strives to justify the diverse expressions of the church into one joyful and passionate worship cry. He collected worshippers around his band Nov. 2 for a passionate and intimate recording at The Factory/Jamison Hall located in Franklin, Tennessee.

The song “Revolution” is an inspirational musical piece from the A Million Lights album. Justifying such a name, the singer told in an interview that this song was the first he composed and finished in the album. He added that there is a requirement to listen more and also talk less. There should be more comprehension and the need to love much better. He said that although the rationale sounds valid at all times, it matters more in the turbulent times of today.
The song is beautiful with the acoustic guitar pairing perfectly with the track's anthemic drums. The soft vocals of Smith makes a perfect accompaniment to transform “Revolution” into a light hearted song. This song is a perfect match for messages of hope which comes with A Million Lights. The album also features tracks like “Forgive” and “Love Always Wins.”

Critics are impressed with Smith's new offerings. They have described his album as an excellent and balanced mix of pop, tropical house, worship music, contemporary, and melodic house. The album, to the surprise of many critics, had influence of EDM as well. They especially praised one particular song, “Louder” where the band blends piano, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and lush string sections to make a song which can be heard multiple times.

At any award show, God shows up. Not literally, but performing artists talk about the influence of their faith in achieving success. 
The 2018 Grammys were no different. Kendrick Lamar won five awards last night and quoted rapper Mozzy in saying “God up top, all the time, real talk.” The rapper has been credited with including more spirituality in his highly praised album DAMN. The rapper has talked about how his relationship with God has influenced both his music and his political activism. 
A historic #GRAMMY-winning night for @kendricklamar.

One of the most praised acceptance speeches was by Reba McEntire for winning Best Roots Gospel Album. Holding back tears she mentioned her love of Jesus and “Our job in the entertainment business is to heal hearts. That’s what God put me on this earth for, I know it is. To help other people. I love my job. I’m so grateful to get to do it.” Her honesty and emotional authenticity has won over the media and helped put her in the spotlight of stories about the Grammys.

The award show also had individuals look at the universal ethic of love that connected to all faiths. There were musical performances that indicated support against both sexual violence and teen suicide. While religion was not mentioned specifically, it has been used by religious individuals as a connection to the teachings of faith.

Ed Sheeran’s Grammy Award winning “Shape of You” has been remade into what many listeners would find a somewhat strange Christian worship anthem.  The original lyrics, which were secular and glorified sexual love, are now rewritten as a proclamation of love towards God. The person behind this transformation is Beckah Shae, a Christian singer who also writes her own songs.
For those interested, Shae has her own record company, Shae Shoc Records and a website in her company's name. The company is partly owned by Jack Shocklee, her husband. To justify the remaking of a popular mass market song, she stated in her website that she came from a broken home in which she has endured multiple challenging times with her mother. This includes abusive relationships and being extremely poor. She stated that she and her mother spent time in battered women's shelters as well. Shae also suffered from substantial insecurities. There were also periods of acute eating disorders. However, she asserted, she knew that God was with her during all her troubles. Shae's passion for God is clearly heard in the remake when she refers to the almighty as “Elohim.” This is the Hebrew for God in Old Testament.
Critics have panned the song. They have described the remake as an awful one. Some are describing the song as a parody. The song name itself “Shape of Jesus” is a parody. It does not invoke piety, but amusement. A particular YouTuber has even bemoaned the twisting of an extremely catchy song and turning it into a bland devotional one with bad lyrics.

Beckah Shae’s rendition of “Shape of you” is 100x MORE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL LAAA OMG HOWWWWWW?!?!😍😍😍😭😭
— Samuel Francis (@SamuelFrancis95) January 15, 2018

Those who hold a balanced view contends that the song is not that bad. The song is clearly sung in an earnest manner. It is thus sensible to enjoy the song for its intentions-an attempt to latch on to the prevailing popular culture. The song is also a repressive one, trying to shame any kind of notion that sex can be an enjoyable activity. For music purists, the worst thing about the remake is the grammatical faults of the lyrics. Many Christians have slammed the song.

Sir Elton John shocked the world with the announcement of his final tour before his retirement. The tour will span three years and involve 300 shows. But Elton John should not just be remembered for being a world-class musician but also a prominent atheist.
Sir Elton John was born in a family that was likely Anglican. But religion is not something that Sir Elton John continued in his life. As a prominent gay celebrity, he has frequently commented on religion for being anti-LGBT. Calling organized religion out for turning people into “really hateful lemmings” he seems to have no problem stating his displeasure. 
This may be connected to him being rejected for adopting a Ukrainian child because he was gay. He has actively worked with Kaleidoscope, an organization that promotes homosexual tolerance in countries formerly controlled by the British Empire. Well over half of these countries have homosexuality as a crime.
Sir Elton John has also made several quixotic comments about religion. He has called Jesus “a compassionate, super-intelligent gay man.” This could just be his war of saying that Jesus would have supported gay marriage.
While Sir Elton John has been outspoken for gay rights he has faced criticism for not being consistent. He performed at Rush Limbaugh wedding, even though the conservative radio host has spoken out against the LGBT community on numerous occasions.
Sir Elton John has said that religion should be banned but never taken a concerted effort to make that a reality. He has not used the tour to speak out about religion and it seems that as he ages he has focused more on ending his career than his views on religion.

Showtime at the Apollo had a Christmas special that might change the way you think of Christmas music. It featured Fifth Harmony, DMX, Snoop Dogg, and was hosted by Steve Harvey and Adrienne Bailon, who also did some singing.
Snoop Dogg and Boyz II Men performed their new song “Santa Claus Goes Straight To The Ghetto 2017.” This is an update on Snoop Dogg’s previous song “Santa Claus Goes Straight To The Ghetto,” which was in the spirit of the James Brown song of the same title. The stage was filled with presents and an ostentatious Christmas tree. Boyz II Men replaced the original crooner on the track, Nate Dogg. The song can be purchased in the Apple Store.

But the show had to be stolen by what may be the greatest idea for a Christmas song. Rapper DMX performed a rap version of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” with Fifth Harmony providing the vocals. While a 9-year analytical study demonstrated that the most modern Christmas song is Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas,” this new version could give it a run for its money. 

Showtime at the Apollo has been famous for its Amateur Night competition and for being a platform for many now established stars. The performance was on Thursday night.

Kim Davis, the county clerk who came into prominence due to her extreme opposition towards gay marriage has written a book. The book, which is titled Under God’s Authority is said to be filled with insights on how to live one’s life as a good Christian.
Davis, who has married four times, clearly contradicting Biblical laws, claimed it was not possible for her to issue licenses to any same-sex couple as it goes against her religious beliefs. It was pointed out to her that the Supreme Court of the United States had legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. 
Davis, who opted for incarceration over issuing legal marriage licenses to couples of the same sex, writes about her experience dealing with homosexual men in her life. 
The book, whose complete title is Under God’s Authority: The Kim Davis Story, was a product of co-authorship. Other than Davis’ contribution, Matt Staver and John Aman also put in their writing and composing skills. Both are members of Liberty Counsel, the anti-LGBTQ organization known for their vehement opposition to gay rights. It is to be noted that Liberty Counsel represented Davis during her legal fight against the state. The organization did this service for free. 
Therefore it comes as no surprise that the Liberty Counsel praises the book. It describes it as a chronicle of a single woman against furious homosexual men who pounded their fists at her so that she could be browbeaten to do what they want. The book also laid out in detail the many hate-mails Davis received, which are described as necessary for doing what she believed was right. 
The website blurb ended with the tantalizing sentence of what the reader will discover when he or she buys the book, namely what God did at a time when one solitary woman bravely refused to compromise on matters of faith. The book also promises to elaborate on how the reader should behave if he or she encounters a similar situation.
It is unclear if the book has value beyond supporting Kim Davis’s religious or political views.

Popular Hillsong Church Pastor Carl Lentz has met with criticism ever since he failed to condemn abortion  on a TV show. When asked his opinions about abortion, the Pastor simply said that the matter is best left to God and that he is nobody to judge. Pastor Carl Lentz appeared on The View to talk about his book Own the Moment.
Amazon
TheFederalist.com contributor, James Silberman, pointed out that the lack of a definitive answer by Lentz showed that the rather watered-down sense of morality existing among modern Christians. In fact, Silberman went a step ahead and even said, “’Live to your own convictions’” is practically the slogan of the abortion lobby,” indicating that not condemning abortion strongly enough is just as good as being supportive of it.
Undeterred by Lentz’s refusal to give a final response, Behar asked if the matter was not one where he could actually take a stand and either condemn or support it. “I think, to me, I’m trying to teach people who Jesus is first, find out their story before I start picking and choosing what I think is sin in your life, I’d like to know your name,” Lentz said, making it clear that he had nothing definitive to say on the matter.

Which truth? Scripture clearly indicates abortion is sin. Carl Lentz could not answer the question
— Kevin McCullough (@KMCRadio) November 7, 2017

Mainstream Christian churches and even evangelicals have always held on to the belief that abortion amounts to murder. As such, Christians, in general, have always considered abortion to be a sin and have always fought against its legalization. As a leader of a church himself, Pastor Lentz’s refusal to give a proper answer has drawn criticism from anti-abortionists because as a Christian, they expect him to take a concrete stand against abortion.

Though Hanukkah Harvie vs. Santa Claus has only just been released (11/1/17), it’s already had an interesting life. There were pretty much only two reactions among those who previewed it: love or hate. Most readers adored the book because it’s a funny story with a heartwarming message. But a few haters scorned it, solely because they can’t abide the word “Chrismukkah,” which they believe advocates the blending of incompatible religions.
Oy, humbug!

But let’s back up. First, I have to admit that HH vs SC was not inspired by a burning desire to endorse the controversial term, “Chrismukkah” (coined by the writers of the early 2000’s teen drama, The O.C.). Though the story does this. Nor did I aspire to choose for the Chosen People their own Santa (after all, Saturday Night Live gave us Hanukkah Harry as far back as 1989). Though the story does this, too. Nor was the idea hatched to promote tolerance and acceptance among people with different cultural/religious backgrounds. Though the book…you get the picture.


Actually, the story is the product of my musing about what might happen if a Hanukkah hero and Santa Claus bumped into each other delivering gifts to the same house. This seemed worth considering because, statistically speaking, such a meeting is very likely now that there are over a million families in North America alone that celebrate both holidays. A number that is growing every year. This uniquely modern question required a uniquely modern answer. Hence, Hanukkah Harvie vs. Santa Claus.
But after experiencing the pushback from a few grinchy readers in the Jewish, Christian, and Interfaith communities, I’m extra pleased the ideas that didn’t inspire the book are in the book.
Hanukkah Harvie vs. Santa Claus says absolutely nothing about how the two holidays are celebrated by interfaith families — it simply celebrates the existence of such families. The notion that the word “Chrismukkah,” all by itself, will brainwash those exposed to it into believing that Christmas and Hanukkah are one hybrid holiday seems based on a rather low opinion of people’s intelligence. Let’s be honest here: anyone who doesn’t understand or care that Judaism and Christianity are mutually exclusive religions is not a loss to either tradition, as they are clearly part of neither. It’s obvious, to me anyway, that “Chrismukkah” is best understood as the season during which both holidays are celebrated under the same roof. And so the term gives us a delightful way to recognize linguistically our progress toward intercultural harmony.
If that’s not something the grinches can get behind, they’ll be pleased to know they can air their grievances when Festivus rolls around.

The cause for the canonization of Pope John Paul I will receive fresh impetus with the publishing of a new book clearing up the conspiracy theories  going around about his sudden death. Pope John Paul I’s reign lasted only for 33 days, one of the shortest in history. As a pope who gained a reputation for being extremely progressive for his time, theorists popped up from everywhere crying foul at his death.
The book has been written by Vatican Journalist Stefania Falasca and is titled, Pope Luciani, Chronicle of a Death. The book was written after careful and exhaustive research and study of documents by Falasca, even of secret documents that she, as vice-postulator of Pope John Paul I’s cause, had access to. According to her book, his death was discovered by two nuns who were in charge of taking care of the pope. This is contrary to the original information that the Vatican released, saying that the Pope’s death was discovered by one of his secretaries.
As per Falasca’s research findings, one of the two nuns, Sister Vincenza, was a bit surprised when she saw that the pope had not yet come out to take his coffee which she had placed in the sacristy at the usual 5:15am. Upon finding no reply from within when she knocked on the door, the nun opened the door herself, finding that the pope had passed away in his sleep. She then informed Sister Margherita, the other nun, about what she had discovered. Now 76, Sister Margherita recounts “I touched his hands, they were cold, and I saw, and was struck by the fact that his nails were a little dark.” 
The previous evening, the pope had suffered a bout of severe pain in the chest while praying vespers with his secretary before dinner. Although his secretary, Msgr. John Magee suggested calling the doctor, the pope refused to see a doctor, saying that the pain would pass soon, which it eventually did.
In new book revealed that Pope John Paul I died of an overlooked illness; died same night he suffered an extreme chest pain https://t.co/et7vbfeI7h

It would be interesting to note at here that it was Pope John Paul I who did away with the royal usage of ‘we’ when referring to the self, as popes traditionally have done. He also did away with the papal tiara and the portable throne on which the pope used to be carried around.

Dan Brown can now breathe easy. His new novel Origin has already topped sales on Amazon.  Fans of the American author are finishing up an addictive mix of conspiracies, travelogue, history, and a good slice of whodunit. The tagline is alluring as usual, with the author asking the reader the rhetorical question of whether God can survive the onslaught of science.
Robert Langdon, Brown's adventurous academic protagonist and symbologist, who loves to travel around the world, stars in the fifth book as well. The book has it all: an assembly line with instant smart-making scientific jargon, familiar heart-tensing situations, and non-stop travelogues to obscure historical locations. All of them are funneled into an ending. Critics described the latter as a contrived one.

Kirsch, a 40-year-old billionaire iconoclast, had already created a ruckus among the world religious leaders. He had called everyone of some value to Spain for a sneak peek of the origins of the human race. He was all set to answer questions like where did humans came from and where are we going. It is no wonder he invited his former teacher to the global unveiling of what can be a potentially over-the-top announcement. The billionaire claimed that religion will lose any significance it had until now. Science will fill the vacuum.
Dan Brown couldn't have picked a better week to release a novel set in Catalonia and Basque Country featuring the Spanish royals. #Origin

Kirsch is assassinated and the story kicks into its heart-stopping pace. Langdon is now racing against time to find who killed him. The academic must also crack the computer password which itself is a poetry line made of 47 characters. Brown pushes in his trademark touches. A conspiracy website like Wikileaks is inserted as a plot device. One of the principal characters in the book is Winston, an artificial intelligence which helps Langdon in his quest. Kirsch designed it himself, a combination of Alfred, Batman's butler, and Apple Siri. The story, as usual, involves the visit to a number of Cathedrals.

One of the most common questions I am asked is why do I wear the hijab and am I forced to do it? Well! I would like to say that my hijab is my identity and I am never forced to do hijab. This is my own choice and it’s my pride. I observe it to please God and in obedience to His commandment. On the contrary, without my hijab I would not be comfortable at all and I never want to lose my identity of being a proud Muslim woman.
The Qur’an says that “There is no compulsion in religion” (2:257). This verse signifies that no one can be coerced into accepting the faith. Unfortunately, many non-Muslim authors have claimed that Islam was spread by the sword. However, when people do accept Islam then it is incumbent on them to accept all the commandments that God has laid out in the Qur’an. One such commandment is that Muslim women should cover their heads with a scarf and wear loose modest clothing. Thus, they follow this guidance to obey God without being coerced by any male or female member of her family.  Every single teaching of Islam is there for a reason; women are to cover themselves to maintain their modesty and their chastity. Personally speaking, I can say when I am more fully covered I feel very comfortable and I can feel the freedom of religion. But it should be noted here that God has actually commanded the men to lower their gaze first and then He instructed the women to do the same. Therefore, it is clear that men also have the responsibility to restrain themselves and be modest as well as chaste (Qur’an 24: 31-32).
I would like to share a brief conversation between a non-Muslim and a Muslim man.  The non-Muslim posed the question as to why do Muslim women have to cover themselves and the Muslim man gave an amazing answer. He said that if you are offered two candies, one wrapped and the other one is unwrapped, which one will you pick? The reply was, the wrapped one. After hearing that, the Muslim said that this is the case with our women. They are wrapped in clothes and protected from the dirt of the outer world.
I strongly believe that the beautiful teachings of Islam are there for our protection, to guard our chastity, and to provide us an amazing path to live a life. However, when I’m told that I shouldn’t be wearing what I choose to wear, then I feel as if people are trying to snatch my freedom of practicing my religion. Freedom of religion is what America stands for. Then how can anyone justify interfering with someone’s preferences of living peacefully according to their religious preferences?
A woman’s status in Islam is way higher than what those who have never met a Muslim would think or those who never search the truth and remain biased would think. As a young woman, I am given all the rights, especially of education which is one of my passions. The Holy Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said “The pursuit of knowledge is a duty for every Muslim, man and woman.” This saying tells us that in Islam both men and women are equally treated even in the matters of education.
Those who oppress women are not the true Muslims because they’ve forgotten the true peaceful teachings of Islam and are just misrepresenting Islam.  The Qur’an upholds equal treatment of both men and women and says, “Men shall have the share of what they have earned, and women shall have the share of what they have earned. And ask God of His bounty. Surely, God has perfect knowledge of all things” (4:33).
The freedom that I am given through my religion, Islam, is all that a woman could wish for. I’m living a peaceful, happy and satisfied life through the freedoms and respect my religion granted me.

			As discussed in article #1 in this series, Western Civilization is in grave danger. If we’re going to prevent the resurfacing of the thought-poisons that materialized World War II and the Holocaust, all the world’s religions must join together: all 4 billion of us!

			How do we achieve such a daunting task?  How?

			By doing something that the world has often found even more difficult:  Understanding Jews.

			Excuse the seeming arrogance, but I propose that Western Civilization needs re-JEW-venation.

			This re-JEW-venation, I believe began with the Second Vatican Council’s Nostra Aetate No. 4, which removed the charge of Deicide (God murder) and the despising of Jesus’ people. Since then, virtually every single major Protestant denomination has followed suit.

			Vatican II, and its subsequent documents, affirmed the continued prophetic, historical, purpose of the Jew AS Jews. They essentially repented of the sins of their Imperial Roman ancestors. So, I’m going to take this as an open door here to simply be myself.
 
Michael Shevack

			After all, it is Judaism that is the spiritual foundation of Christianity. It is Judaism, together with Christianity, that is the spiritual foundation of Islam. The categories-of-thought that propel the entire, progressive, world historical viewpoint–  religious or secular, theist or atheist– are founded upon the justice-driven Hebrew prophets.  Even Marx, a lost Jew, who is still pretty popular in China, taught a variant of biblical prophetic thinking.

			So here are some re-JEW-venation lessons that I believe can save our world (and my people):  

			God comes first. Creation (like our planet) comes second. Human beings and their civilizations come third. This is the order of priority established in the Book of Genesis.

			Even if you don’t believe in God, it would be  impossible to deny your need of air, water, food, and other supplies that you did not bring into existence yourself. Something Bigger is here, deity or not.

			Pollute the air, and your children die of asthma.

			Better respect what’s here, or the Power that made it.

			Your life depends upon it.

			God, Creation, Humankind in that order of importance, can re-JEW-venate  our world.

			It is not the power of government, secular or religion that is of Primary Importance. It is not the power of a nation, any nation, including Israel. It is not the power of a corporation. It is not the power of any mere mortal leader or any cultic group, no matter how powerful.

			We are all, simply, humbly, creatures. Even our national leaders are. (Surprised?) 

			Humility can re-JEW-venate our civilization. And these days, humility can also clean up our cruel sound-byte driven media, that degrades people for ratings.

			The Law for the King is the same as the law for the peasant. 

			Ask King David. He’ll tell you about this, after he had an extra-marital affair in office. (#Metoo!)

			The leader of a country is an equal citizen to anyone else. The law must be obeyed by each, equally, with no special privileges.

			Since Nixon was pardoned, the United States has lost this ancient Hebrew law, which had been rediscovered in the Enlightenment. Now leaders who are felons are pardoned. Government is hi-jacked to favor wealthy and monied-elite. We are falling back to a two part “justice” system, one which favors the upper crust and the other for the commoners. This is George Vth British. But it also Imperial Roman, the same kind of elitism which ransacked Judea, and contaminated Christianity until democracy re-birthed the Hebrew view of equality under the law.

			1. Correct Priorities. 

			2. Humility.

			3. Equality under the law.

			This is how we re-JEW-venate the forces of Good that can prevent the proto-fascism that is resurfacing in the U.S., Russia, Hungary, Holland and many other places.

			Now, if there are some antisemites out there who are feeling afraid, relax! Please don’t worry. These re-JEW-venation principles have been part of Christianity, Islam and Western democratic thinking in virtually every civilized nation for over 2000 years. 

			Fear not.  Jews are not going to “take over”.

This is a call, not quite desperate yet, but a critical call nonetheless:
Will the good and noble religions of the world stand up? Will we stand up together? Will we galvanize our combined well-over 4 billion people? Will we create a blessed buffer against another wave of ancient insanity?
Michael Shevack
You may have noticed as late, the tremendous resurgence of the following phenomena: extreme authoritarian governments, with militant or fascist under-or-overtones; an aggressive push of economic powers against each other and a consolidation of wealth in an elite group with a despised underclass; the exaltation of more “white” culture over more “colored” culture; a push back against feminism, homosexuals; the usurping of indigenous lands and the violation of environment; and a hated religious group that nations are afraid are “taking over”.
Oh, and let’s not forget, ancient, very ancient– an increase in anti-Jewishness, in fact, a 60% increase by some measures.
Underneath this mayhem is an extreme idolatry-of-thought, which become institutionalized from the very moment the Western world supplanted Biblical law with Roman imperial law, somewhere in the Third Century A.D, and laid the foundation of Western Civilization.
The problem, too deep to fully unpack here, is a distortion of Pauline philosophy-somewhat rabbinic in its origin– with its seeming dualism of “spirit” vs. “body”– with pagan Roman imperialism. To the “covenant as to the spirit” vs. “covenant as to the flesh”, is added “Roman” vs. “conquered”, “saved” vs. “damned”. Later on, is added the modern dualism of Descartes’ res extensa (“outer” kingdom of extension) and res cogitans (“inner” kingdom, of thought). This combined with a lot of ancient Gnosticism, from many sources, revered within our scripture and its appendices, created a lethal thought-war between “mind” and “matter”.
Notice the analogical pattern:  The phenomenon rising is a consolidated force of cultic mind. What is being attacked are all the classic analogues of “nature”— women, “gays” (considered pagan, or “from the land), indigenous peoples, ecological or planetary issues, “bodies”. This includes “people of the covenant as to the flesh”, and their “land”, i.e. the Jews.
This is the gasoline, that the Hitler’s match ignited, with a lot of help from distorted Vedic philosophy. It was not happenstance that Hitler, ironically, sought to bring back Nature as God, toppling a feeble, “moral” conscience of Jews and Christians, resurrecting the pagan Roman Empire as his Third Reich. Unfortunately, his god-Nature was tinged with a contaminated, brutal “Darwinism” which equated “survival of the fittest” with providential preference. Evil.
Auschwitz Concentration Camp
Now, these exact same categories of thought, were also present in a more general, and less “religious” context than with Hitler. While in the West we saw the Holocaust, it is not happenstance that in the East, we saw Hiroshima;  the ascendency of human mind over the “mother”, matter.
And, analogously too, after World War II, the world saw, shortly thereafter, a re-balancing of this aggressive power-of-thought:  the rise of all things “natural”: women’s liberation, gay liberation, people of color liberation, ecology, Aquarian Age philosophy, Transcendentalist Eastern gurus.  And, yes, the historical return of the People of Israel to their “land” in 1947.
The Roman diaspora seemed to end. But, it did not. We are in danger, still:
This distortion of Judeo-Christian theology goes to the core of our identities as religious people. We do not proclaim, Gnostically, a radical duality between “mind” and “matter”, or between a good human “civilization” and a “nature”, which is considered “evil” or fallen. We proclaim a God, The Creator, who created Creation to be “GOOD”. This God created the human being to have dominion, but not domination. We have dominion (over life on the planet, and over matter) under God– i.e. respect for the Creator’s Creation. We are entitled to be creative, technological within Reason, God’s REASON, His/Her/Its Logos, or “design specs”. We do not have dominion based upon our own thoughts, self-delusions and self-idolatry.
For Christians– if you do not mind me saying so– as the very foundation of Western Civilization, Christ’s Incarnation implies that any dualism between body and spirit, if it did exist by virtue of some Original Sin, has been obliterated, through his death and resurrection, and ascension. The incarnation is antithetical to this brutal, and indeed, contemporary-ancient-pagan history that is resurfacing, now in a more threatening nuclear form.  Imperial pagan Rome always burned the land! Why not the whole world?
So, I’m calling on all good and noble religions, to stop the return of this endlessly-returning cycle, where “mind” is pitted against “nature”, and the God of History is not the same as the Creator God, but, in fact, superior to it. This still poisoning the blessing of the God of Abraham, who chose Abraham, after the “political idolatry” figured in the Tower of Babel story.
Please hear me, perhaps, a lone voice in the wilderness. I’m calling for a force of love and activated-justice, a spiritual pressure to stop this Gnostic tendency from resurfacing and cutting down the tremendous Life-Force that has been rebuilt since the end of World War II.
I’m calling for the world to once again, save my people, who, in this analogical system are, I fear, doomed. But, as we know from World War II, it’s not just about the Jews.

My mom, my sister and I after the Scientology New Year’s Celebration at Flag
This winter I took a trip to Clearwater, Florida with my family to take Scientology services at the spiritual headquarters of the Scientology religion, known as the Flag Service Organization or simply “Flag”.  I wanted to tell you a bit about the trip itself, as I think it should add a bit of color and insight into the life of a Scientology family.  I’d previously described the trip that we took to Los Angeles so that my wife could partake in Scientology services there.  On that trip I ran child activities so my wife could focus in on her services, and on this trip the roles were reversed.
The Church of Scientology Flag Building in Clearwater, Florida
The reasons why people take trips to Flag are as varied as people themselves. Being both the largest Scientology organization in the world, as well as its most advanced, Flag provides Scientology parishioners with not only same counseling and study opportunities as local churches of Scientology around the world, but also has a vast array of Flag-only services which each have their own particular purpose and appropriate use depending on the person.  For me, my purpose for going to Flag was for Scientology counseling (called auditing), with the intention of reaching the State of Clear.  (see explainer link here on what it means to “go Clear”)
Flag itself is a fairly massive complex of buildings.  The majority of the work that Scientologists do at Flag takes place either at the Flag Building – the home of most Scientology training & auditing spaces, or at the Flag Advanced Org, a building a few blocks away where more advanced services are taken.  This video here gives a good overview of what Flag is and what it consists of:

Flag also provides a number of options for lodging for parishioners coming in for service, including the historic Fort Harrison hotel as well as several others around downtown Clearwater.  My family has split time, staying sometimes in the Fort Harrison, sometimes at the recently-renovated Oak Cove (which has fantastic views of the Gulf of Mexico), as well as staying with my wife’s godsister – a lifelong friend of the family.
The view of Clearwater Beach and the Gulf of Mexico from the Oak Cove
My job as an IT engineer allows me to work remotely, so I scheduled my auditing sessions around my work, and also gave myself time to take frequent outings with the family to the beach, and to also spend time with my sister and mother who have worked at Flag for nearly the last 20 years, and are members of the Sea Organization, the religious order of the church.   And they’re some of my favorite people in the entire world.
My trip to Flag was in two chunks – a few weeks before Thanksgiving on my own, and then I came down after Christmas with the rest of my family.  My dad, who works at the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, DC, had also flown down as well, so I got to not only have a family vacation with my kids, but also my own family as well, which was a treat.
My mom, sister, my father & I having brunch at the Sandcastle religious retreat
The family time I got to spend, and the fresh air I got at the beach was only the icing on the cake, and that “cake” was the amazing Scientology services I partook in while at Flag.  Being that it is a religious retreat, the entire organization at Flag is aligned around making for a perfect, distraction-free experience while one pursues the spiritual goals one’s there for.
I wrote at some length in the article I recently wrote about attaining the State of Clear, what it was that I did in the auditing I did at Flag, and what it meant for me personally, as a husband, and as a father.  I’ll not repeat that here, but to say it was life-changing would be a travesty of an understatement.  The clarity of thought, the absence of untoward impulses and feelings I can’t understand or control and do not want, the love I feel for my family and my friends, it’s just been a fantastic journey for me and worth every second I’ve put into getting there.  So many people in this world feel they have to learn to “cope” with these shortcomings and limitations, and it’s just a miracle to be able to be at a point of causation, confront, peace and understanding about myself.
At Flag, I had the amazing privilege of having my sister supervise my progress to Clear. This picture here was giving my sister the planet’s largest hug immediately after attaining the State of Clear, with family, close friends & Flag staff on hand to witness the occasion. It was an amazing turning point in my life.
That brings me to that very pertinent question I’ve gotten asked, which is: “Is it worth it?”  In this case, I could compare this “vacation” that I took to any number of vacations that my IT-worker friends take on a regular basis.  One could go to New Zealand or Bali rent a sailboat in the Azores or have fun blowing a massive bunch of money on a lavish gambling spree in Macao.  Everyone’s got their own idea of what would comprise a “good time” or the “best vacation ever” and what would be “worth it”.   A lot of these people arrive back to work after a few weeks away, a bit refreshed (or hungover) from the time away from work, but aside from that, not having any particular lasting valuable aside from some great photos.


For me, the most important thing in my life is to be the best dad, the best husband that I can be.  I want to do that for my kids, I want to make sure they have a dad that is present, caring, and supportive.  I have seen other people grow up with parents who are so engrossed in their own messes that they have no time to spend quality time as parents. I’ve seen too many parents that want nothing more than an escape away from the kids.
But having gotten a chance to not only spend quality time in a lovely environment with family and to make myself into a better daddy, that really did indeed just make this the best trip I’ve ever taken.

God designed us as sexual creatures with a purpose in mind. He meant it for good: as a way to know Him more fully. Our sexuality is a window into our Creator; He loves passionately, He designed us to be His beloved bride, and He wanted a way for humans to reproduce and to express their love for the one they have committed their lives to in a unique and special way. 
God wanted married love to have a sexual expression, which separates it from all other love. He designed our bodies with hormones and a sexual nervous system with sexual body parts. He decided to give men a body part to fit within the female body and a female organ that has the capacity to not only give birth to another human being but to receive a man with pleasure. Attraction, sexual urges, and desire are all part of our wiring. When you really think about how our bodies fit together and are drawn toward one another, it is some sort of miracle. Only God could have come up with this master plan. We learn of God’s wondrous story in Genesis 2:
God formed man out of dirt from the ground and blew into his nostrils the breath of life. The man came alive— a living soul! Then God planted a garden in Eden, in the east He put the Man he had just made in it. God made all kinds of trees grow from the ground, trees beautiful to look at and good to eat. The Tree-of-Life was in the middle of the garden, also the Tree-of- Knowledge-of-Good-and-Evil (Gen. 2:7–9).
God took the Man and set him down in the Garden of Eden to work the ground and keep it in order. God commanded the Man, “You can eat from any tree in the garden, except from the Tree-of-Knowledge-of-Good- and-Evil. Don’t eat from it. The moment you eat from that tree, you’re dead” (Gen. 2:15–17).
God said, “It’s not good for the Man to be alone; I’ll make him a helper, a companion” (Gen. 2:18). In other texts it says God will make him a helpmeet, God uses this term several times to describe a woman and many more times to describe Himself. God calls Himself our Help Meet. This shows the female is not less than male, but equal to and different from the male.
So God formed from the dirt of the ground all the animals of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to Man to see what he would name them. (God empowered Man to influence, name, create and act. 
Whatever the Man called each living creature, that was its name. The Man named the cattle, named the birds of the air, named the wild animals; but he didn’t find a suitable companion (Gen. 2:19–20).
What a task God gave to Adam! I believe part of what God was doing here was to help Man develop an awareness of his aloneness. I imagine as Man named the animals, he must have noticed there were two of the same kind—one with male parts and the other with female parts. I also imagine he watched them frolic and mate and wondered where his playmate and partner was. We humans often don’t notice a need until we become aware. God didn’t assign a random task to Adam, but created a life changing event for the dawning of awareness of Man’s desire for a complementary counterpart.
God loves to meet our needs, so He proceeds to put Man into a semi-coma. “God put the Man into a deep sleep. As he slept he removed one of his ribs and replaced it with flesh. God then used the rib that he had taken from the Man to make Woman and presented her to the Man” (Gen 2:21–22).
I can only imagine Man’s thrill at God’s presentation. As a matter of fact, he exclaims, “Finally! Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh! Name her Woman for she was made from Man” (Gen. 2:23–24). Can you hear his joy? At last, finally, he has someone like himself!
He then prophesies, “Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and embraces his wife. They become one flesh” (Gen. 2:24). He recalls the animals and how they are partnered with one like themselves, but slightly different from each other. 
He must have envied how they had one another, a companion, a sexual partner who brought not only pleasure, but offspring. Now God has made him one of these. He is delighted and can instantly imagine how this partner will cause him to change his priorities to make room for her in his life. Then Scripture tells us, “The two of them, the Man and his Wife, were naked, but they felt no shame” (Gen. 2:25).

Geneva. A city proud of its distinction as a global hub for diplomacy and embracing of a motto indicating light after darkness has sadly lost its art for dealing with people in a sensitive and effective way. What exactly has taken Geneva into darkness? It’s new law banning women, specifically Muslim women, from wearing the burkini to public swimming pools. 
Much like the failed attempt by France this year to ban the full covering wetsuit worn by women seeking to swim modestly in public, Geneva is now taking a dive into murky waters to attempt their own ban on the burkini. The claim that the city council has declared is that it’s a matter of hygiene. Yet since the law’s language is targeted towards a ban on the burkini, it then becomes a direct splash towards targeting Muslim women. The argument that the burkini is unhygienic is simply an undercover language for segregation. Specific guidelines have been given for what exactly is allowed in a public pool area and they are clearly prohibitive of any woman or man who wishes to wear a swimsuit that covers their body entirely. Promoters of such laws argue that such laws instill European values, yet these laws are truly far from enhancing the values that Europe espouses.
Banning the burkini falls under the precept in limiting a woman’s right to choose what she wears. Such laws are in many ways oppressive and are contrary to European secular values. Women should be allowed to choose their personal attire and in no way should be forced to accept laws that go against their personal or religious values. Once a city begins to segregate women based on their personal beliefs a slippery slope begins that makes women an outcast rather than an integrated part of society. Eventually, this public ostracization will be enforced in schools, public buildings and other shared spheres of society. Segregation and alienation have detrimental effects on any civilization and further wedge any real chance in promoting respect, tolerance, and equality. 

Women who choose to cover their body should not be viewed as presenting an oppressive display of their physique. In reality, their choice to shun any attire that is overtly revealing in public only upholds traditional standards set by Europeans as a form of decorum of respect and decency.  The burkini is in no way a symbol of oppression and it is appalling for those making the case that it is somehow similar to wearing a swastika in public. This is an extreme and disturbing comparison, to say the least. The swastika is representative of oppression and hate whereas the burkini is simply an option in modest attire for swimming and is no different than wetsuits worn by many swimmers or people who have issues regarding exposure to the sun or other skin conditions. 
Geneva’s city council should consider the words of the worldwide spiritual leader of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community the Khalifa of Islam His Holiness Mirza Masroor Ahmad who has stated that on the one hand Western governments attack Islam indicating that there is compulsion and hardship in it, while on the other side they are guilty of interfering in others personal matters. Laws like the burkini ban claiming to free women are actually imposing restrictions upon them by not allowing them the right to choose their own clothing. Those who see the burkini as oppressive should really begin to tackle the root causes of oppression which lie in discrimination, lack of access to services, and unequal economic opportunities. These injustices against women are prevalent worldwide and banning a woman’s right to her personal attire is a direct form of true and real oppression. 
Furthermore, a legal ban against the burkini is no different than governments that restrict women’s rights. Muslim women must be given the ability to make decisions about their lives and religion and not be banned by this choice. Rather they should be supported and not have any city regulate and limit how a woman expresses her religious beliefs with her outward appearance. This clothing ban is an interference to how Muslim women present themselves while actively participating in Geneva’s society. Geneva should encourage the freedom that Muslim women have made to wear the burkini by allowing them the right to practice their beliefs publicly. The city council is prohibiting women’s rights and needs to look beyond what a woman wears if they truly want an emancipated society. Otherwise, such laws will inevitably force the targeted women to drop out of public view and by having these women hidden, Geneva will promote the oppression and offenses it claims to be fighting. 
Geneva must protect itself from past European failures of ostracizing people to make them feel like outcasts. It should realize that such bans only end result will be a segregated and disenfranchised society. By pretending the burkini ban is about hygiene, Geneva is only fooling itself and enabling discrimination. And sadly by doing so,  Geneva is closing the door on any liberty and light it once proclaimed.

On December 6, 2017 a significant, controversial event shook the representatives of all major world religions: the United States of America recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It looks like a new turning point appeared in the 70-years-long history of the Palestine conflict.

			The key phase of the struggle for the ancient city between Jews and Arabs is usually considered to take place in 1967, when Israeli troops captured Jerusalem during the Six-Day War. Another prominent circumstance happened in 1980 when the Jerusalem Law, a text proclaiming Jerusalem as the “one and indivisible” capital of Israel, was adopted by the Knesset.

			And, last but not least, the United States of America’s recent unilateral recognition  of Jerusalem as capital of Israel is likely to mark a third turning point in the conflict.

			The whole world responded immediately to the recent US move. The Pope, for example, called for ""respecting the status of the city in accordance with UN resolutions"", thus not recognizing it as the Israeli capital only. The leaders of all Christian denominations in Jerusalem, including the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophilus III, called upon Donald Trump to reconsider this dangerous step on the same day that the US President announced his decision. Furthermore, an extraordinary summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), spearheaded by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was immediately held in Istanbul and decreed that the Islamic world regards East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.

It is difficult to overestimate Jerusalem’s significance for any Christian, Jew, Muslim, and for any major political figure. Therefore, it is rather odd to witness no reaction to this announcement from Patriarch Bartholomew, the “first among equals” in the Orthodox world. But this impression is rather treacherous.

			In spite of his title of Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I has long ago lost his right to freely express his opinion and implement his ideas. And this is not a speculation, this is rather a fact: Patriarch Bartholomew has so far kept silent on America's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

			However, can the head of one of the largest churches in the world keep the distance from the escalation of a conflict threatening such dramatic bloodshed among the several religious communities populating the Palestinian soil? Since the US President acted in favor of the Jews, he triggered indeed angry reactions and the aggression of the Muslim community around the world.

			However, His Holiness Bartholomew I has not been vocal in solving the problems of the Muslim community, unless the Muslims in question are Turkish. Turkish Muslims represent indeed a peculiar category for the Patriarch; likewise, the relations between the United States and the Republic of Turkey constitute a very touchy subject for Bartholomew I. And he has no other choice than to keep silent.

			On one hand, should Bartholomew I choose to condemn the actions of President Trump, problems with the Greek American Archdiocese would likely arise. Since it is no secret that the Archdiocese is one of the main “suppliers of donations” towards the Turkish Fanar, Bartholomew I has his hands tied. On the other hand, should the Patriarch support the actions of the US authorities, he would automatically undermine the Fanar’s relation with the Turkish Presidency. And it is prominent that back in 2007 Erdogan, Turkish Prime Minister at the time, explained the patriarch “where he belongs”: the Turkish Supreme Court of Appeal denied indeed Bartholomew I his right to universal status for a reason, referring to the fact that ""The Patriarchate only has the permission to stay in Turkey, is just an object of Turkish law and there are no legitimate reasons for its recognition as universal."" This means that, in the eyes of the Turkish authorities, the patriarch himself is not the spiritual leader of the world Christian community, but only the head of the local community of Orthodox Greeks.

Bartholomew I recently visited Jerusalem, where he received the honorary title of doctorate at the Hebrew University on December 6, 2017, on the same day of the historic recognition of the new capital of Israel by the USA. As he later explained, the title was granted him ""in recognition of the merits in the interdenominational dialogue.""

			There is now a greater need of the interdenominational dialogue than ever before. Nevertheless, Patriarch Bartholomew I did not release any statements on the Jerusalem issue, though he benefits of a certain magnitude in the world politics. Does this circumstance entail that Patriarch Bartholomew's influence in the Christian world is not as strong as it is depicted?

At this time of year, media often ask how Scientologists observe the holiday season. To answer that question, the Church of Scientology International provides the following:
How do Scientologists celebrate the holiday season?
Because the Scientology religion is practiced in 167 countries and territories, Scientologists come from a wide variety of faiths and cultural traditions.
But no matter what their background, they, like most people, gather with loved ones to enjoy the warmth of friends and family and celebrate the joy of the season.
Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard honored the great religious leaders of the past for the wisdom they brought to the world, writing that Scientology shares “the goals set for Man by Christ, which are wisdom, good health and immortality.” It is in this spirit that Scientologists celebrate the holiday season, whether Christmas, Hanukah, Kwanzaa or any other religious or cultural tradition.
Scientologists live by a code which includes: “To use the best I know of Scientology to the best of my ability to help my family, friends, groups and the world.” During the holiday season, Scientologists are especially active in this respect, volunteering in a wide range of endeavors to improve the lives of individuals and the community and bring joy to those who may need assistance.
In addition to regular Scientology religious services, Churches of Scientology provide many special holiday activities for Scientologists and open houses and tours for members of the community.
Scientology Churches and their parishioners also organize and support numerous charitable events during the holidays, such as toy drives, food and clothing collections, and parties for underprivileged children. Scientologists visit nursing homes, orphanages, hospitals and homeless shelters, bringing holiday cheer through gifts and entertainment.
The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International in Hollywood produces Christmas Stories, an annual holiday benefit performance presented in the style of a 1930s radio show with traditional and original stories, songs and skits. 
For nearly two decades, proceeds have benefited the Hollywood Police Activities League’s annual Christmas party for underprivileged children and PAL’s year-round inner city programs for at-risk youth.
In an annual tradition beginning in 1983 when Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard provided a 60-foot Christmas tree as a gift to the people of Hollywood, Winter Wonderland holiday village is erected each year on Hollywood Boulevard as a service to the community. The opening of the village on the Sunday after Thanksgiving signals the start of the holiday season, when Santa arrives in his sleigh—always the final float in the famed Hollywood Christmas Parade—and lights the tree and village. Made possible by the Friends of L. Ron Hubbard Foundation, Winter Wonderland, attracts more than 40,000 Los Angeles residents and tourists to daily live performances by community vocal and instrumental groups and snow banks imported for the season.
Winter Wonderland is also presented for three weeks each December in Clearwater, Florida, as a service to the community and to benefit needy children. The Church of Scientology and parishioners organize and sponsor the Christmas village, with tens of thousands of residents and tourists enjoying Santa, Mrs. Claus’s cookie decorating kitchen, live entertainment by local school, church and professional performing groups, a petting zoo and pony rides.
Winter Wonderland is also an annual event at Saint Hill,  home of Scientology Founder L. Ron Hubbard from 1959 to 1967 and UK spiritual headquarters of the religion since 1959. Created as a public service for the local community, it is open for several weeks in December. Tens of thousands of lights illuminate the Saint Hill landscape. Visitors are welcome to visit Santa in his grotto, pet and feed the reindeer at the petting zoo, ride on Lennie the Land Train, play in a bouncy house and enyoy the ice skating rink.
The Church of Scientology and Community Centre of Dublin, opened in October this year, has organized a Winter Wonderland for the South Dublin community complete with Santa, face painting, creative craft making with Santa’s elves and Christmas funfair rides, Admission is free but in the spirit of Christmas, visitors are invited to bring new packaged toys or make a donation in aid of local charities supporting homeless families.
The spirit of Christmas—peace on Earth and goodwill to all—is a tangible goal that informs the lives of Scientologists around the world throughout the year, as reflected in “The Aims of Scientology” by L. Ron Hubbard: “A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where Man is free to rise to greater heights…May a new day dawn for you, for those you love and for Man.”

Abdu’l-Baha once gave the definition of a Baha’i as “someone who loves and serves all humanity.” Therefore, becoming a Baha’i does not involve a ceremony or particular observance. Baha’is do not engage in rituals or baptism and do not have a clergy.
The path towards becoming one is purely personal, spiritual, and heartfelt. You become a true Baha’i when you start to believe in Baha’u’llah and in the teachings of Baha’i. You simply need to make an individual commitment to follow the teachings of Baha’u’llah.
One who truly desires to join the Baha’i faith goes through an inner process of finding spiritual guidance and wisdom. They discover the Baha’i teachings, explore them, and begin to acknowledge and love Baha’u’llah and his message of the restoration of one world faith and unity of all people. The believer begins to identify with the internal mystical truths and the social purpose of the religion. 
The path of search may take a lifetime for some people; however, others may recognize the truth of the Baha’i teachings instantly. The religion does not prescribe a timeline or right or wrong pathway of search and discovery. The members believe that each person walks a personal spiritual journey and makes their own personal decision. After one as walked the mystical path and has looked inside their soul, he or she is close to achieving complete transformation to a Baha’i.
The physical procedure of becoming a Baha’i and a member of the Faith is effortless and depends on the religious and civil laws of a country. In most countries, you will just sign a Baha’i declaration card that declares your wish to become a Baha’i. Through it you recognize “Baha’u’llah as the Bearer of God’s Message for this Day” and his teachings. You acknowledge the authority of institutions that manage the dealings of the community.
Accepting the Baha’i Faith is entirely voluntary. Once you sign for membership, you will be welcomed by your local Baha’i community and worldwide. You become one with peace, justice, unity and love, the pillars of Baha’u’llah’s Revelation. This brings you great peace, joy, and freedom.

When it comes to religious matters in South Carolina, it is no surprise Christianity dominates. The surprising fact is the religion which follows in popularity is not Judaism or Islam: it is the Baha’i Faith. As per findings of the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, about 18,000 Baha'is practice their faith in the state. The organization conducts its religious census every 10 years.
The expansion of the Baha'i faith began during the 1960s and the 1970s. The Baha'i communities started to increase their strength in the state of South Carolina concurrently with the Civil Rights Movement. Documented history exists of teaching conferences being held in Beaufort, Frogmore, and also at Penn Center, St. Helena Island. The ASARB recorded about 18,000 adherents and about 22 congregations within South Carolina. The religion even has its own radio broadcast station-the aptly named Radio Baha'i, transmitting at WLGI 90.9 FM. This station is located in Hemingway, a little to the west of Myrtle Beach.
The growth of the Baha'i and the Civil Rights Movement are inextricably linked. The leaders of the faith started to make honest efforts to attract African-Americans into the fold from the early 1960s. The rising popularity of civil rights was in perfect tandem with people getting attracted to the core values of Baha'i: oneness of humanity along with embracing diversity.
ASARB
Would you believe Baha'i is supposedly the 2nd largest religion in South Carolina?
— L.F. Owls (@CLindberghGore) August 8, 2017

It was observed that teams of Baha'i, mostly African-American themselves, visited almost every resident preaching a message of unity of all religions, humanity, and God. They proclaimed that Baha'u'llah, the founder of Baha'i, is the return of Christ. Robert Stockton, a historian specializing in researching the Baha'i faith in the United States, said that the response to the message was enthusiastic. People listened closely to what the proponents of the new faith had to say, and since there was no chance to enroll people to the Baha'i faith in the first time, there were promises of a follow-up. Sadly, these follow-ups never occurred. The only consolidation activity which occurred was the setting up of the radio station.
The lack of consolidation means that as in 2017, only 4,500 Baha'is have their correct addresses in the Baha'i database. It is clear that the remaining members are insufficiently active to update the address when they went from one residence to another residence. Thus there is a distinct possibility that the number of Baha'i in South Carolina could actually be higher.

A survey conducted by Public Religion Research Institute has resulted in findings which surpass standard religious identity . Approximately 2,000 Americans participated in the PRRI survey during the first half of 2017. The results showed that 18 percent of Americans identify as spiritual but not religious. Persons who are part of the latter tend to be more educated and younger in age. Approximately 40 percent of those hold a four-year college degree. About 17 percent hold post-graduate qualifications. Their political views tend to be liberal when contrasted with their political peers. About 40 percent of them term themselves liberal. Approximately 27 percent of the U.S. population are neither religious nor spiritual.
A surprising find when it comes to the spiritual but irreligious Americans is they continue to identify with specific religious traditions. Only about 30 percent are spiritual but unaffiliated with a religion. 18 percent describe themselves as a white mainline Protestant. An identical percentage, 18 percent, identify themselves as Catholic. About 13 percent belong to non-Christian religious traditions like Buddhism, Judaism, or Hinduism. Non-white Protestants are only 10 percent. Evangelical Protestants comprise five percent.
PRRI
According to Dan Cox, the Research Director of the PRRI, spiritual but not religious Americans demonstrate more tendencies to assist others. These Americans are much more likely to help someone and do personal favors. This was found by the survey which discovered that 41 percent of Americans have permitted others to get ahead compared to only 30 percent of the non-spiritual Americans. This survey discovered that greater spiritual levels are proportional to better life satisfaction. About 61 percent of those surveyed spiritual but non-religious Americans and 70 percent of spiritual and religious U.S. residents are extremely or fully satisfied with their lives. The same opinion has been said by 53 percent of the religious but not spiritual, and 47 percent of people who are completely free from both spiritual and religious opinions.
The PRRI survey also found that spiritual Americans have a higher probability compared to people with less spiritual leanings to go through inspirational experiences with different kinds of media. About 49 percent of spiritual Americans have reported that they felt inspired, moved, or touched while viewing TV during the time period of the survey. In contrast, approximately 36 percent of the Americans who identify themselves as non-spiritual reported similar experiences.
Fascinating: abt 70% of people who say they're ""spiritual but not religious"" are religiously affiliated. https://t.co/9uZs6E5OBw

Bananas: delicious fruit, Gwen Stefani anthem, and possibly the proof that God exists? Ray Comfort, a New Zealander Christian, has been making this argument for 20 years.
His position is that God created the banana for humans. It is meant to be used by an opposable thumb, is shaped for the human mouth, and is easily identifiable by its color to be edible.

Still not convinced? So are many Atheists. In fact, Comfort’s arguments have been so routinely attacked in the religious debate about Creationism that they have created their own term to describe them: the “banana fallacy.”
But Comfort has not been discouraged. In fact, he has partnered up with Kirk Cameron, former actor and Christian spokesperson, to release a movie about his crusade to prove the existence of God. Titled The Fool it is set to be released to the public in 2018. It happens that Comfort has realized the humor in what he has argued and is now finding different avenues to discuss faith. In the trailer’s intro, he describes himself as “the laughing stock of atheists worldwide.”

The trailer continues on with a montage of notable atheists such as Richard Dawkins, Hemant Mehta (The Friendly Atheist), David Silverman of American Atheists, and a slew of vague complimentary quotes from members of religious organizations. It is unclear if the movie will continue to be about bananas or find different ways to show scientific proof about the existence of God.

A federal judge, Terrence Boyle, has ruled the prison system of North Carolina must recognize humanism as a faith group.  The U.S. District Judge ruled that prison authorities must permit the adherents of humanism to meet and study their beliefs. This ruling was prompted by a case when a North Carolina inmate helped by American Humanist Association (AHA) filed a suit against officials of Department of Public Safety in 2015. The former accused prison leaders violated equal protection and religious establishment clauses enshrined in the United States Constitution by repeatedly rebuffing of the requests of inmate Kwame Jamal Teague. 
The District Judge wrote the prison officials were unable to prove that humanism is different from the religions recognized within the prison system. Boyle ordered North Carolina to change its computer system so prisoners who have declared themselves as humanists are registered as such. The recognition of humanism as a faith group is already present in federal prisons since 2015. 
The judge’s order prescribed that the state prison authorities collect a list of all approved faith groups. The authorities must provide them the required space and time for due study and worship. The order also noted that there are not written standards to define what makes any group a faith group. 
Kwame Teague became an inmate of a North Carolina prison in 1996. He was convicted of kidnapping and then murdering two individuals in a field outside the town of Goldsboro. Two life sentences were handed to him. The 45-year-old became a well-known fiction author when he wrote tales concerning a Dutch “gangster extraordinaire”. He also lobbied for six years to make sure the prison system in North Carolina recognizes humanism to be a faith group. His petition was rejected multiple times as humanism is “a philosophy of life” and not a religious practice, as per the court filings. 
Judge Boyle’s decision was greeted with praise by Roy Speckhardt, executive director, American Humanist Association. He said that this decision enables inmates identifying themselves with humanism to study and discuss values within a group like other religious inmates. The AHA defines humanism as a nontheistic belief system which promotes rational thinking. Humanism also encourages ethical living for the betterment of society.

A Federal grand jury indicted Houston megachurch pastor Kirbyjon Caldwell with crimes of defrauding investors of an excess of one million dollars.  The indictment consisted of a total of 13 counts. Other than Caldwell, Gregory Alan Smith, a financial planner from Louisiana, was also charged with money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Caldwell was once a spiritual advisor to the former U.S. President, George W. Bush. 
Caldwell holds the position of pastor at the Windsor Village United Methodist Church. The megachurch has approximately 14,000 congregants. 
As per the indictment, the 64-year-old Caldwell took advantage of his influence as the pastor of the prominent Houston church to lure vulnerable and elderly investors to the tune of approximately $3.5 million. He was helped in his criminal activities by the 55-year-old Smith. The latter used his position of manager and operator of Shreveport based Smith Financial Group LLC. The two sold Historical Chinese bonds which are not recognized by the current Chinese Government. The issuer of these bonds was the pre-1949 Republic of China Government. These are for all practical purposes worthless investments. 

So sad to hear about Pastor Kirbyjon Caldwell. Prayers for him, his family, and Windsor Village 🙏🏾
— ryancgeorge (@ryangHTX) March 30, 2018

As per the indictment, both Caldwell and Smith did not pay back investors their money but kept them at bay with numerous payback promises. They promised super high return rates and used the money for personal loans, mortgages, and credit card balances among others. The high rates of return were part of the lure. Investors were promised a mind-boggling 15 times the original investment amount. If convicted, both men face considerable time behind federal prison bars. They will also be compelled to return millions and more as compensation. The pastor may lose his Houston home. 
As per the court filings, Caldwell misused money from this fraudulent investment scheme to finance his mortgage. The senior pastor continues to be a limited partner with Houston Texans. The latter is investigating the allegations. Both the accused could spend a total of 20 years in prison with imposed fines at more than one million dollars. 
Dan Cogdell, the defense attorney representing Caldwell, issued a statement saying his client has been falsely accused. The lawyer described his client as a religious leader who has complete trust in not only the legal processes but also his faith. The attorney expressed confidence that his client will be set free.

The Michael Mason directed third movie in the God’s Not Dead series, unimaginatively titled God’s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness is a mellowed down version of the strident religiosity of its two predecessors.  The story, however, continues to be programmatic and based on presumptions.
According to Forbes, God’s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness brought in $2.6 million during its Easter weekend box office opening. In comparison, the first movie in 2014 took home over $9 million in its opening weekend and over $60 million since then. God’s Not Dead 2 brought in over $7 million opening weekend and has earned over $20 million to date.
The Light in Darkness installment is produced by Arizona headquartered PureFlix. The same ministry and media giant has also distributed the movie. The film stars David AR White, who is also the co-founder of PureFlix. The story begins from where the previous film ended. White plays Pastor Dave, a good-natured man of God who is arrested for not sharing sermons with the federal government. The recurring theme of fictional Christian persecution is renewed. 
Video screenshot
The film tries to prove its alleged Christian persecution by depraved secular authorities by putting the church helmed by Pastor Dave in the middle of a state-controlled university campus. The place of worship is thus positioned squarely inside the hot zone of diversity advocates who want to shut down free speech. They are helped by the college board head (the character played by Tatum O’Neal) whose only aim in life is to throw the congregation off the university premises, even as he knows that the church precedes the founding of the university. Minor characters in the film ask vital questions like why Muslims and Jews can voice their opinions known but Christians cannot.

Just watched God’s Not Dead: A Light In Darkness; consider it the best in the trilogy. Good cinematography, acting, directing & editing. David White did a great job in the lead role. The message: love is what the world needs 2 see from the church 1st. Very powerful. Alex Kendrick pic.twitter.com/jnbogR9HEw

The third film picks up pace when a vandal, who goes by the name of Adam (played by Mike C. Manning) throwing a brick which smashes through a window and causes an explosion in the church. The reason for such vandalism? His girlfriend, the devout and beautiful Keaton (played by Samantha Boscarino), has dumped him for not subscribing to her faith. The movie shows that Adam is blaming the church for his shortcomings. The problem with this portrayal is that this depiction is too much preachy, to put it mildly.
The core of the movie is the tempestuous relationship between Dave and Pearce, his lawyer brother (character depicted by John Corbett). Pearce was a Christian who has lost faith post three bad marriages and one triple bypass surgery. The interactions between the two are the least ham-headed acting in this movie. This film, all in all, breaks a new path compared to the previous two films. The feel-good ending remains the same.

There have been several different strategies to addressing gun violence in the United States. Pastor Robert Jeffress, speaking to Fox News, described one of the more popular theories given by conservative religious figures and news outlets. He told Fox that we need more religion in society.
.@robertjeffress: ""@POTUS is the most faith-friendly president we've ever had, and that includes Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush."" pic.twitter.com/EQqMt1KACu
— Fox News (@FoxNews) March 25, 2018

Specifically, Jeffress talked about “a crusade by secularists” and a return to “our religious past” that would create the moral compass needed to stop school shootings like in Parkland, Florida. Rick Santorum has said displaying the Ten Commandments would help create the morality that is missing in students. 
Really? 
The idea that religion solves violence is both tone deaf and brain dead. Religion does not automatically make individuals less violent. There are too many historical examples where religion has been the justification for violence rather than a deterrent: Crusades, Inquisition, Colonialism, Slavery, and a history of Anti-Semitism. Learning about religion did not make people search for peace but gave a greater purpose to bloodshed. The using of religious morals to overcompensate for an erosion in personal ethics is built into our history as a society.

It is also objectively false. The most secular nations are some of the least violent, most happy, and have highest respect for human rights. Some of the most religious societies like Brazil or Mexico have some of the highest murder rates. Of course, correlation is not causation. 

Just because a country is religious does not make it violent. Which is the same reason when we look to the United States I won’t say that the reason the most religious states like Arkansas and Alabama also have some of the highest murder rates it is not automatically connected to faith. Or the fact that the more secular states have a better index for societal health, which includes violence.

The biggest error individuals like Jeffress and Santorum make is they believe pushing Christianity will not increase violence. But they forget there are not only Christians in America. By increasing one particular religious view it can lead to anger or tension between Christians and Atheists, Muslims, Jews, etc. In fact, with the rate of violence against Muslims increasing at an alarming rate the worst thing that could be done is to explicitly support Christian faith in public settings. 
Religion does have some value for decreasing violence, but not meant entirely on morality. Organized religion becomes a way to bind a community together and creates social capital that can bring together different groups. Social Cohesion Theory is based around the notion that the finding of commonalities with others make you more willing to embrace them and less likely to cause undue harm.
Arguing that everyone needs to have religion to be moral is, at best, a knee jerk reaction. It presupposes that individuals do not have any morality and need it from a preferred extremal source. Instead, it may be more effective to think of the methods of violence, like the number of guns or ways that interfaith dialogue can occur to bring divergent communities together. Because if we have learned anything from school, it is that posting a bunch of rules on a wall doesn’t always matter to a group of students.

Rabbi Yuval Cherlow, a well known Israeli Orthodox rabbi, told an Israeli media house that it would be kosher, perfectly alright from the religious point of view, to eat pigs if they are created through genetic cloning. These artificial gene-tweaked pigs could also be eaten by partnering them with dairy products. 
Rabbi Cherlow said that this point of view is true only if the meat being consumed is grown through technological means from pig cells. An observant Jew cannot eat pork products if the genetic material of the source animal is an original one. Surprisingly, the Talmudist did not stress on the distinction. In an interview at a symposium in Bar Ilan University, he said that rabbis should approve cloned meat so that people must not starve. He also cited two other reasons: avoiding the suffering of animals and preventing the incidence of pollution. To buttress his point, he said that when the pig cell gets used and used to synthesize food, the cell’s original identity is lost. It can then be consumed without hesitation. Pork created in this way can be thus consumed with milk. Pork is one of the toughest prohibitions in the Jewish religion. 

The argument for food consumption rule relaxation among devout Jews is not new. Even in 2012, an American rabbi, the Orthodox Rabbi Menachem Genack of New York, said that the burger made from test tube meat could be consumed simultaneously with dairy products. The Jewish religion prohibits eating any meat with dairy products if the meat concerned was taken from an animal which lived prior to it being slaughtered for food. Genack said test tube meat can be regarded as ‘parve’: neither dairy nor meat. This meant cheeseburgers were an acceptable meal option for conservative Jews. 
Genack at that time referred to artificial beef burger production by scientists working at a university located in the Netherlands. There was no mention of pork in his speech and comments. Cherlow is aware of the commotion his opinion could generate. He said that inevitably there will be major disagreements in the Jewish community on the subject of consumption of cloned meat. He said that although there could be ‘merit’ when it comes to prohibiting pork, the Jewish laws related to this specific instance should examine the requirements of humanity as a whole and not as a case related only to Jews.

The march of Europe is clearly secular. A report published by London's St. Mary's University discovered a substantial number of young people in European countries are leaving organized religion far behind.  This survey's respondents were aged between 16 years and 29 years. The report, titled “Europe's Young Adults and Religion,: showed the least religious European nation is the Czech Republic. A staggering 91 percent of Czech respondents admitted to zero religious affiliation. Coming close are Netherlands, Estonia, and Sweden. About 70 percent to 80 percent of the young adults in these three countries regard themselves as “nones” or non-religious. Conversely, Poland shows maximum religiosity. Only 17 percent of Polish young people are non-religious. Lithuania comes second with 25 percent. The author of the report is Stephen Bullivant, the theology and sociology professor at St. Mary's University.
According to Bullivant, religion in Europe was in a “moribund” state. Other than a few exceptions, most young adults do not identify with any religion or practice it. He warned that this will only increase in the future. The professor opined that Christianity as the default European religion is gone and with a large probability of never coming back. This could continue for the coming 100 years.
St. Mary’s University
The data however displayed notable variations. Countries geographically located adjacent to one another could throw up radically different religious profiles. This holds true even if the nations have similar historical and cultural backgrounds. Religious affiliation has gone down everywhere except for Ireland, Poland, and Portugal. Only in those three nations do more than 10 percent of young individuals attend church services multiple times per week.
Bullivant said a large number of Europeans have not passed through the church doors after they got baptized. Cultural religious identities are not being passed from the parents to their children. It simply does not stick to the new generation of young people. The UK statistics were affected by many people emigrating to the island nation. About 20 percent of British Catholics were foreign-born. The academic pointed out that since the birthrate of Muslims is more than the general population, their retention rates are also much higher. Those who practice religion in modern Europe swims against the “nones” tide.

Is it possible to have the right Jesus of salvation, but the wrong model of Jesus for living it out? No matter how implausible it might seem, the Apostle Paul addresses this very concern in II Corinthians 11:1-4: 
“I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness.  Yes, please put up with me! I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. 2.) I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. 3.) But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 4.) For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.” (NIV)
Notice Paul begins by making light of what he is about to say, an indication, perhaps, of his concern for its incredulity, but none-the-less, follows it with an adamant plea for them to hear him out, anyway.
In verse 2, Paul, seeing an obvious need for bringing clarity to the way that God sees them/us as a bride once we are in Christ, then expresses his fear, in verse 3, for our vulnerability, as a bride, for being deceived as Eve was by the serpent.”
The last place we might think deception would come to us is from within the church through its leadership.  Deception is, by nature, subtle and often occurs over long periods of time.  And as we already know from the case with Eve, once we have been deceived we then become deceivers.
And when Paul says “he has promised us to one husband, Christ,” although, he is speaking to the church, both male and female, it is men who have, historically, been its leaders. Making it critically important to our understanding that the vulnerability for both men and women is that for “being deceived as Eve was by the serpent,” and not just women.  Jesus, having fulfilled the role of “last Adam” (I Cor. 15:45), leaves only the vulnerability of Eve for us to be identified with once we are betrothed to him. 
Consequently, a church leadership that doesn’t realize its vulnerability for being deceived as Eve was, in all likelihood, has already been deceived and has now become the deceivers of the very ones God has entrusted to their care.
In verse 4 Paul, essentially, not only confirms the probability that deception will come to us from within the church, he goes on to say that when it does “we put up with it easily enough.” In other words, it is not just a possibility that we can have the right Jesus for salvation and the wrong model of Jesus for living it out, but a probability. 
So, how do we know if we have been deceived? Is there a scriptural litmus test for making such a determination?  Or is it based solely on the fact that we stand on the truth of salvation through Jesus, and as long as we remain faithful to this message deception cannot possibly overtake us? II Corinthians 11:4, alone, contradict this assertion.
After more than 20 years of studying James 1:27, “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, (in order) to keep oneself unspotted from the world,” (DBY) the conclusion I have reached is for this passage being, perhaps, the most critical litmus test by which we might determine the degree of our own deception.
In my recently published book, Spiritual Widowhood, 17 of its 26 chapters are devoted to an almost word-by-word, and line by line, examination of James 1:27 for the purpose of proving this claim. Key to this study is for the more accurate meaning of the word, “religion,” to be understood in the context of worship.  Worship through serving, or the service of worship, as opposed to a worship service.  
Therefore, according to James 1:27, our worship will either be considered by God as being  “pure and undefiled, or impure and defiled: The former bringing restoration, the latter desolation.  Based on 30 years of serving widows and realizing that little has changed in that time for the ways they are cared for by a majority of churches, has led me to conclude that widows remain the most overlooked and least cared for people in the world, today.  Consequentially, when the connection is made between Jesus’ own assessment of the condition of Israel recorded in Matthew 23:38, “Behold, your house is left unto you desolate,” and their guilt for “devouring the widow’s houses,” (Mat 23:14, Mark 12:40), what other conclusion can be reached for the belief that our own house has, in all probability, become a house left desolate?

Several religious organizations have sent public letters and letters to Congress arguing against the new health care bill, whose vote was just delayed in the Senate today. 
A coalition of 14 Jewish organizations led by the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism sent letters to all 100 members of the U.S. Senate urging them vote no on the law. Additionally, Bishop Frank Dewane, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) Domestic Justice and Humane Development Committee, released a public statement criticizing the bill. 
Both criticisms have stated that the bill, which would leave 22 million people uninsured, violates the tenets of aiding the poor and the vulnerable. The Jewish letter made their point clear: “States will face impossible choices prioritizing among people with disabilities, low-income Americans, and children and will have no option but to slash services that are essential for the daily lives of millions.” 
Religious leaders express concern that creating millions of uninsured Americans will also overburden religious organizations that provide medical treatment. “Prayer, pastoral care, and loving friends can’t replace medical care,” said Rev. Carol McVetty, interim executive minister of the American Baptist Churches of Metro Chicago. 
While some religious groups in the past have agreed on overturning the Affordable Care Act, religious groups have been relatively quiet over the health care bill that was revealed after tinkering by Senate Republicans recently.

J.K. Rowling, the author of the highly popular Harry Potter series, has indirectly written about the damage brought by sowing hatred and division towards outsiders. It is natural that Rowling was disgusted by the anti-Muslim rhetoric expressed in the aftermath of the Finsbury Park Mosque attack .
Darren Osborne, reported by police as a 47-year-old white male and a British citizen, drove a van into a crowd outside the mosque. The incident left a man dead and injured ten others. This attack took place during Ramadan, a holy month for all Muslims. Authorities have classified this dastardly attack as a terrorist attack.
There is a marked rise in anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric all over Europe and in western countries. The UK was not immune to such hate. Rowling swiftly commented on the many hate statements towards Islam which were made before the attack. She particularly zeroed on to a particular British newspaper which phrased the news so that it was blatantly anti-Muslim. The celebrated author said the newspaper has misspelled “terrorist” and it wrote “white van driver” in its place. She said it is a perfect time to analyze why and how Osborne was radicalized.
Let's talk about how the #FinsburyPark terrorist was radicalised. pic.twitter.com/Lx1woEaLKL
— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 19, 2017

What many “'right wingers” failed to notice was that Osborne, the terror suspect, was being beaten up by bystanders present in the scene when he was saved by the imam of the mosque. The imam, Mohammed Mahmoud, protected him from people who tried to beat him up and kick his head. Osborne reportedly got out from the van and shouted that he wants to kill all Muslims.
Theresa May, the UK Prime Minister, has described this event as a terrorist attack which targeted the Muslim community specifically. The Prime Minister, in her official statement, asked British citizens to unite.
Rowling pointed out through her tweets that a few media houses did not let up their blame game by blaming the mosque for the attack. The victim shaming was present even though the Finsbury mosque was well known for its role in combating extremism. She also used a tweet from Nigel Farage, the right-wing British politician, for the far right's role in promoting such violent activities. One of her tweets showed Farage standing near for-Brexit advertisement, sowing hatred towards different races. She skillfully pointed out the various methods by which anti-immigration politicians whip up hatred against refugees trudging in from the Middle East.

The United Kingdom will be the first country to accept the anti-Semitic definition as explained by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). The acceptance is being made to manage the rising hatred increasingly being expressed towards Jewish people. This move makes it harder for culprits abusing and harassing Jews to escape punishment. This definition can be used by public bodies, councils and universities. Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, has expressed disgust that anti-Semitism can be found inside UK politics.
Opposition parties have welcomed the move. The Labour Party, which has faced a number of accusations of failing to manage anti-Semitism within its own ranks, said that it is receptive of new definitions to tackle it. The Labour party spokesperson, Jeremy Corbyn concurred and said that the party believes that any behavior or language which displays hatred towards the Jews can be counted as anti-Semitism. This can be as unacceptable or repugnant as any other kind of racism. The British Government will soon publish the response to the calls of the Home Affairs Select Committee for political leaders to do more so that the issue can be managed.
IHRA’s definition of anti-Semitism is:
Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.
The guidance in its detailed form says it will be labeled anti-Semitic to “accuse Jews of being more loyal to Israel or their religion than to their own nations.” Anti-Semitism accusations are also valid if one says that Israel's existence is racist.
There were a number of concerns regarding criticism towards Israel crossing into blatant anti-Semitism. The issue is so deep that Jeremy Corbyn has commissioned a report into this issue inside the Labour Party. These fears were not unfounded as Jackie Walker, the vice-chairperson of Momentum, a group supporting Corbyn, had her post taken away when she questioned the necessity of security positioned at Jewish schools. She also spoke in a disparaging tone concerning Holocaust Memorial Day.

PM Theresa May announced today UK will formally adopt @IHRA_news definition of anti-Semitism. Important step in combating anti-semitism 1/2

Prime Minister May criticized the Labour Party on their failure to stamp out anti-Semitism within its ranks. She decried that such twisted views are being seen in British politics.

In an interview for the Wednesday issue of a Belgian Catholic weekly, Pope Francis called the act of spreading false news a “sin.” The pope condemned the misuse of media by powerful entities to spread fake information for their own vested interests and compared the people who love doing so to those who desire to eat fecal matter, or those who suffer from coprophagia, “that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true.”
Pope Francis has always been very direct about his views and has shared his opinion on matters such as politics and journalism. A few months ago, the pope directly called journalists “terrorists” for spreading fear and hatred at an audience with famous figures from the media. From the pope’s behavior, it’s very obvious that he’s not afraid to address issues directly, without trying to beat around the bush.
This interview is another example of the pope’s radical way of addressing issues.
Pope Francis acknowledged the power of the media as being a very influential force in shaping opinions and empowering people through knowledge and information. However, he expressed his disappointment that this same power has been exploited to spread lies, thereby causing widespread misery and untold suffering among people.
The monarch of the Vatican believes that the media should be absolutely transparent and honest in how they function. He observed that in today’s world, companies and governments are constantly trying to cover up scandals and crimes through media. The pope said that people who work for the media and journalists should resist being used by vested entities and report issues in all honesty, as they are.
Pope Francis compares fake news consumption to eating faeces – coprophagia. Put that in your papers #DailyMail #TheSun #DailyExpress

Pope Francis warned journalists against falling prey to various temptations in their careers. He calls the desire to spread faulty information, to spread lies about someone and to defame someone as temptations in journalism. The pope exhorted journalists to overcome these temptations and to stick to the truth at all times.
“Disinformation is probably the greatest damage that the media can do, as opinion is guided in one direction, neglecting the other part of the truth.” -Pope Francis
The pope’s words were prompted when the issue of the shooting at a pizza parlor in D.C. came up. The incident was a result of false information that was spread by a Trump supporter, Michael G. Flynn, who said Hillary Clinton was using the restaurant to run a pedophilia ring.

			The Vatican has angered the LGBTQ community yet again by reiterating its stand against the ordination of homosexual men as Catholic priests. The sweeping reforms that Pope Francis has been introducing also include a more accepting stance towards people of the LGBTQ community. However, gay marriage and ordination of gay men are still going to remain church mandates that will remain unchanged.

			When Pope Francis said, “Who am I to judge?” in 2013 in relation to gay priests, the whole world, especially the LGBTQ, assumed that the church would be open to accepting the ordination of gay men as Catholic priests. However, the church just released a new document that confirms the church’s non-acceptance of homosexuals into the clergy.

			The church had officially issued a statement in 2005 announcing that gay men were not allowed in the seminary. Today, the Congregation for Clergy has declared that seminaries cannot allow gay men to be priests and that bishops, and rectors of seminaries and other authorities should make sure that no gay men are admitted into the priestly vocations. The document established once and for all the men who have “deeply rooted homosexual tendencies” should not be allowed to be Catholic priests. Seminaries have also been directed to examine the candidates for homosexual tendencies and bar them from continuing ahead on the basis of their judgment.

			The fight to allow gay men to be Catholic priests, however, cannot bear much fruit. The church, in fact Christianity itself, is intrinsically against homosexual behavior. As such, the appointment of gay men as priests would essentially be a refusal to accept the directives of the Bible, thereby rendering the credibility of the Church questionable to both, Catholics as well as non-Catholic Christians.

			The document, dated December 8th, clearly exhorts church authorities that they cannot appoint anybody with “deeply-seated” homosexual tendencies or practice homosexuality. In fact, the document also declared that candidates who as much as support the “gay culture” should not be considered for Holy Orders.

			Although experts suggest that the way the document is worded may leave gaping holes that can be used as loopholes which will allow gay men to enter the seminary, the fact remains that the Church seems as opposed to homosexuality as it always was. The gay community that was hopeful only a few months ago that the Church is moving towards a more liberal stand towards them will be greatly disappointed, especially since it has the approval of the Pope himself.

-Photo: New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia
The Philadelphia-headquartered New Sanctuary Movement has seen 300 churches spread all over the United States openly say that they are willing to offer undocumented migrants sanctuary from immigration authorities after Donald Trump became president-elect of the United States. The Movement has popular support, with the number of supporters to the program rising from 65 volunteers to an excess of 1,000 people from the time of election.
Similar pro-migrant sentiments were echoed by Church World Service. The latter said that about 400 churches all over the United States are willing to open to people facing the risk of deportation. Other than churches, an increasing number of synagogues are also engaged in preventing deportations. About 24 U.S. cities, which include the likes of New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, have declared themselves as “sanctuary cities.” Mayors of these cities will not cooperate with any federal immigration order which could end in deportations. In response, Trump said that such cities will have their federal funding scuttled.
Trump, in the course of his election campaign, has said that he will deport about 11 million migrants who are in the U.S. sans any documentation. After becoming president-elect, the real estate billionaire turned politician said that he has plans to incarcerate or jail about three million convicted criminal migrants.
Trump's pre-election rhetoric did not stop at ejecting undocumented immigrants. He had also pledged to construct a wall along the United States- Mexico border which will bar illegal immigrants from entering the U.S.
The electoral victory of Donald Trump has led to unprecedented support and inquiries from congregations all over the U.S. and they want to join as sanctuary sites. According to Peter Pedemonti of New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia, churches are extremely interested and the present coalition consists of 17 churches. Two synagogues have also joined in. All of them are united to oppose any deportation and also offer sanctuaries as veritable safe havens.

The sanctuary concept is not new. It has found note in the book of Numbers of the Hebrew Bible itself. Modern day places of worship can be considered by enforcement authorities as “sensitive locations.” The Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement regards them as sensitive and prefers to avoid engaging undocumented immigrants at such centers. The list of such sensitive locations includes schools and hospitals along with places of worship.

The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) has reported that a total of four mosques have received letters saying when it comes to the treatment of Muslims, President-elect Donald Trump will follow Hitler's example of treatment of Jews. Of the four mosques, three of them are in California while the remaining one is in Georgia. All four letters were written by hand.
The CAIR said that the letter was identical in all cases and written by hand before being photocopied. The recipient mosques are the Islamic Center of Long Beach, Evergreen Islamic Center located in San Jose and Islamic Center situated in Claremont.
The letter addressed the reader as “children of Satan” and expressed the opinion that Muslims are filthy and vile. The content stated the ancestry of Muslims to be of animal nature and evil. It also accused them of worshiping the devil. It warned that for Muslims, their day of reckoning is imminent.
The photocopied handwritten letter further went on to state that President Donald Trump is the new sheriff in America and he is going to make the United States shine again. The content states that Trump is going to start this shining process with Muslims and urged Muslims to move out of Dodge. The letter ends with a proclamation that it is an excellent time for patriotic Americans.
It is to be noted in this regard that Trump at one time in his election trail had called a complete stop on Muslim immigration to the United States. CAIR has released a statement saying that the letters should be investigated as they can be construed as a religious intimidation. There has been no announcement regarding charges and police have not yet identified the sender.

These letters are a few of the examples of rabid anti-Muslim immigration. This hateful rhetoric is tied to Trump winning the presidency. According to CAIR, Muslim Americans all around the United States were recipients of mysterious robocalls which asked their religious identity. Many are afraid that these calls are tied to the Muslim registry proposed by Trump. Law enforcement were unable to trace the calls. More than 700 anti-Muslim incidents were counted by Southern Poverty Law Center between November 9, the day Trump was elected president, and November 16. CAIR cited data provided by FBI to show that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67 percent, from 154 to 257 incidents, between 2014 and 2015.

			About 4,000 faith leaders from different religions have given their signatures to a letter which urges Congress to keep the Johnson Amendment. This legislation prohibits politics from the pulpit or equivalent commanding stand. President Donald J. Trump has pledged to destroy this law. Trump, during May's National Day of Prayer held in Rose Garden, signed the executive order which forbids the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enforce this amendment.

			The letter states that the signatories are leaders in their respective religious communities and extremely opposed to any kind of action which repeals or weakens the present law that offers protection to houses of worship so that they do not become a part of partisan politics. They point out that changing the Johnson Amendment will threaten the independence and also the integrity of houses of worship. The law forbids houses of worship or any other similar tax-exempt organization to oppose or endorse any political candidate.

			This letter does much more than opposing Trump's rhetoric. A provision was added to a certain House appropriations bill which will make it almost impossible for the IRS to enforce the Johnson Amendment.

			It is of vital importance that leaders of different faiths speak up regarding this matter. This is not simply that the repeal of this particular law will undermine their respective religious institutions, it is also as President Trump claims to act on their behalf when he speaks concerning the repeal of this amendment. Other than this letter, an earlier letter was also previously sent signed by a total of 99 denominational and religious groups, to prove that Trump's support to repeal the Johnson Amendment is the wrong step.

			A broad spectrum of clergy along with lay members, from Methodists and Muslims to individual groups holding metaphysical beliefs, were lead by the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty and the Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Other sponsoring groups of that letter include Catholic, Unitarian Universalist and Jewish organizations. Signers came from all over the United States, from Alabama state to Wyoming. 
This is very heartening development to FFRF, which is suing Trump for saying churches don't have to follow the Johnson Amendment. https://t.co/FYgku63geF

			Other than the faith leaders, about 4,500 non-profit organizations have submitted to Congress their own letter to support the Johnson Amendment. The letter expressed concerns that opening non-profit organizations to endorsing particular political entities will lead to erosion of public trust on these organizations. These will also undermine any action to do any good work in their respective communities.

			An international study conducted by Nature Human Behavior, a journal, revealed that atheists are suspected in greater numbers of doing evil deeds compared to Christians, Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus. The study discovered that atheists are widely regarded as more likely morally depraved. They are also considered as dangerous.

			The study had 3,000 individuals scattered across 13 countries as respondents. The list of countries ranged from secular ones like Netherlands and China to nations predominantly made of religious believers like India and the United States. All countries had populations made up of a mix of Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and the non-religious.

			The results of the study are surprising as even as the world is slowly growing secular, many of its inhabitants, including to the researchers' shock, atheists, too subscribe to the view that people will behave badly unless they are afraid of being punished by the gods. The results clearly display that religious belief is intuitively believed all over the globe to be an important safeguard against immoral conduct. Participants of the study were provided a description of one fictional evildoer who had tortured animals when he was a child. The person then grows up and becomes a teacher. He mutilates and murders five poor people who were homeless. Half of the study group was questioned as to how likely the evil person believed in religion, and other half was questioned about the probabilities of him being an atheist.

			To the surprise of the researchers, the team discovered that people were twice as probable to make the assumption that the depraved individual described above is an atheist. Will Gervais, psychology professor, University of Kentucky, and the co-author of the report, said that it was a shock to see atheists holding similar views. He continued on to say that he suspects this result came from a prevalence of the deeply entrenched religious mores. These hold true for even extremely secular societies as well. People continued to hold the notion that religion could be a moral safeguard.

Two countries buckled the trend- New Zealand and Finland. Only in these two secular countries were there inconclusive anti-atheist prejudice. Atheists were most distrusted in religious countries liken United States and the United Arab Emirates. It is much lower in the secular nations. The authors of the study also pointed out that in a number of countries, atheism can be fatal for people holding such views.

“Every addicted person brings with them a distinct personal history, which should be listened to, understood, loved, and, where possible, cured and purified. We cannot fall into the injustice of classifying them as if they were objects or broken junk…”Pope Francis
Getting high and organized religion. These two constants of human history have been at odds, most notably in the modern world. Most religions have historical roots with adulterant use, yet most religious leaders advocate abstaining from drugs.
Therefore we need to understand that the views on drug use by religious organizations are more complicated than one would think. Some have specific laws, other interpretations, and some religions have no official message about the use of narcotics. 
The answers may surprise you.
Use hashtag #FaithInRecovery to follow our multi-part series.
While The Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion, has a consistent religious doctrine on the use of drugs and moderation of alcohol, it does try a holistic approach to combatting addiction. The Church of England Board of Social Responsibility has supported the decriminalization of marijuana and the easing of penalties for drug laws. 
The Church did stir controversy last year when they used a drug addict to represent Jesus with a crown made of syringes. The Anglican Church used the images to represent the healing change many drug addicts had gone through by converting.

The Baha’i Faith explicitly prohibits drug use: “Beware of using any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor in the human temple and inflicteth harm upon the body. We, verily, desire for you naught save what shall profit you.” Alcohol is also prohibited.
Baha’i scholars state this comes from purity of the soul. They believe the spiritual effect on an individual is far graver than the legal consequences or health effects of drug abuse.

Buddhism does not have direct rules against drug use. In fact, Buddhism doesn’t really have direct rules against any behavior. It offers guidance on how one should try to live their life. Buddhism does argue pollutants should be avoided. The Dalai Lama has stated drug use hurts the mind’s ability to be introspective, which leads to unintended and unguided consequences. 

There is no official doctrine on drugs in Catholicism. The Bible does not directly state “do not smoke marijuana.” The Catholic Church has strongly been against the use of drugs for nonprescription use. Pope Francis has called drugs “evil” and does not support their legalization. His approach, matching his more liberal style, has been to focus on saying “yes” to spirituality. 

There are several lines of Scripture recommending a sober mindset in general. “Do not conform yourselves to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect.” 
How does the Catholic Church match the ideology of saying no to drugs while allowing alcohol in their ceremonies? The answer is moderation. The Catholic Church argues alcohol can be moderated, while most narcotics cannot, which allows the use of alcohol versus other substances. This does not mean it is encouraged. Most priests encourage  sobriety. 
Christianity has the same viewpoint as Catholicism: No substance use, although alcohol is okay in moderation. However, there are Bible passages indicating total non-use: “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith.”

Hinduism has one of the most intertwined connections with narcotics use in its origin. Soma, a drink with psychedelic properties, is directly mentioned in the Vedas (the first Hindu texts). Some images of the god Shiva depict him with a marijuana pipe. 
While some Hindus still use marijuana or psychedelics most Hindus dissuade their use. While there is no direct religious text denying them, leaders declare it hurts the ability to achieve spiritual harmony. Again, the goals of spiritual harmony and drug use are seen as contradictory. 

Islam has a strong stance against the use of any substance, with direct quotations in the Quran about it. “Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer.” Therefore, many Muslims are taught to be completely substance free. Under Islam it is considered to be haram (unlawful). Some Muslims argue the Quran only bans alcohol and if the Quran does not explicitly deny something, it is permissible.

Interestingly some extremist groups like ISIS give their fighters amphetamines and argue it is justifiable because it is being used for a higher authority and has medicinal purposes.
The purity of the body is a consistent theme in most religions. Jainism follows that overarching ethic. Members are instructed to abstain from anything intoxicating, unless for a medical purpose. The pollution of the mind should be avoided to avoid disrupting the state of supreme being called Jina (Conqueror).
Unlike other religions, Jainism does not allow alcohol use. Jainism has a strict diet that is vegetarian and also excludes some vegetables like onions and potatoes. This is based on their principle of non-violence. The goal of Jainism is to escape the cycle of reincarnation. The spiritual effect, or Karma, of violent actions, stops this from happening. Since alcohol involves fermentation, which includes microorganisms, it is not considered vegetarian. 
In Judaism, the body belongs to God, therefore, the body must be treated with respect. While alcohol can be consumed at festivals and ceremonies, like the Sabbath, it must be done in moderation. All other substances are banned. 

Like other Judeo-Christian denominations, total abstinence is not required. Wine “gladdens the human heart.” It just can’t be excessive. Additionally, the physical health of the body is seen as a form of worshipping God.
Jehovah’s Witnesses emphasize the study of the Bible to overcome a substance addiction problem. The code of behavior is based on Proverbs 3:5, 6 – “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”
Mormonism is known for outlawing alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. This comes from The Word of Wisdom, a revelation made by the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. The spitting of tobacco juices during Church meetings caused Joseph Smith to ask God if tobacco use was allowed. The holy response not only included tobacco, but alcohol, hot drinks (i.e. tea and coffee), and meat. Although coffee and tea are banned, it is not because of their caffeine content. Church doctrine does not specifically say caffeine is not allowed.

These restrictions gained more strict compliance after the elimination of plural marriage, arguably to increase the Mormon group identity. 
There is no explicit ruling about drugs. The Mormon Church has stated anything which weakens the body weakens God’s creation and is not allowed. “The spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples.”

Read the previous article in this series:Faith in Recovery Pt. 1: Can Faith Help Battle Addiction?
In Scientology, it is taught drugs are bad and should not be used. Scientologists believe drug residue accumulates in the body and an intense detox therapy is needed to remove them. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, developed a series of technological devices to help recovery from addiction. Therefore, in order to achieve a powerful spiritual connection, drug use should be eliminated. The Church of Scientology supports programs who help counter drug abuse and addiction, including Foundation for a Drug-Free World and Narconon, a drug rehabilitation program. Foundation for a Drug-Free World has a program called The Truth About Drugs, which disseminates drug education information online and around the world. 

Paganism represents a diverse set of viewpoints of worship and personal belief. Pagans generally view alcohol liberally. It is used in ceremonies and the enjoyment of alcohol is seen as an enjoyment of a gift from the Gods.
While some groups (covens) and individuals do use drugs as a way to achieve an increased level of spirituality, it is generally frowned upon. Personal responsibility is emphasized, as well as moderation.
Rastafarianism allows the use of marijuana for worship and as a part of religious rituals.

The variation between different belief systems means there are different variations on the use of drugs. Some religious practices directly involve the use of psychotropic drugs. The Native American Church uses Peyote to have spiritual visions and as a part of their ceremonies. They are legally allowed to do this. Other groups appreciate the influence of alcohol as a part of the natural world. 

Ayahuasca, one of the most powerful hallucinogens on the planet, is used by South American tribes as part of a powerful religious experience. This has gained popularity globally, with thousands of tourists venturing to partake in the drug and ritual.
This religion has an intimate connection with alcohol. Sake, “the liquor of the gods,” is consumed at special occasions, like births or weddings. There is even a holy sake, Omiki, practitioners drink when visiting a shrine. 

Given the high alcoholism rate in Japan and few seeking treatment, it is unclear if this practice condones the use. It may be linked to cultural practices that go beyond the religion.
There is some historical evidence marijuana was used for religious ceremonies, but it was not consumed. 
There are no moral absolutes in Shinto. The main ethical code is to follow Kami (spirits/deities). But even the Kami makes mistakes and are contradictory. Shinto does try to eliminate impurities. This is called Tsumi and stands for pollution or sin. 
While there is no specific mentioning of narcotics, it can be argued they are Tsumi. This would require a cleansing ceremony, potentially using alcohol.
Sikh doctrine is one of the few religions to specifically mention drug use. It is not vague about the prohibition of drugs: “Those mortals who consume marijuana, fish, and wine – no matter what pilgrimages, fasts, and rituals they follow, they will all go to hell.” 

The reasoning is that intoxicants affect your ability to focus on God all the time. “Those who do not use intoxicants are true; they dwell in the Court of the Lord.” 
There is an exception. The Nihang of Punjab, a Sikh military order, used marijuana in meditation. This was banned in 2001 by the ruling body of Sikh clergy. The leader of the Nihang at the time refused to follow the ruling and was excommunicated. Its use for meditation is still continued by some Nihang.
Taoism, like many religions, did use some substances historically. Specifically, hallucinogenic mushrooms were used for Taoist alchemy. However, Taoism does not condone their use. This is not a specific edict. 

Taoism is about creating personal harmony. The addictive nature and intoxicating effect upon emotions and mental abilities is discouraged. “Riding the chase on horseback over the fields drives you crazy when you overdo it.” The focus should be on a purity of conduct.

Interestingly, individuals are adopting principles of Taoism for drug recovery. The practice of meditation to build mental stamina has been linked to aiding in the elimination of addiction. There are parallels in addiction therapy and Taoist teaching. “Only when we are sick of our sickness shall we cease to be sick.”
A common theme in Wicca is the respect for individual autonomy. The focus is on someone’s connection to the natural world. If this comes through a consciousness enhancing substance, then so be it. There is no official rule condoning or denying drugs, beyond the use of some substances in rituals.

Those who celebrate Christian Easter are familiar with the traditions: celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, eating a large meal with family and friends, and the odd combination of eggs, bunnies, and candy. Somehow the latter seems disparate, perhaps another tradition started by the retail industry, but it actually makes complete sense after digging to find the origins of the ritual.
Easter is basically the festival of Ostara. What is Ostara? Well first, it is a pagan holiday that is still celebrated, most notably by Wiccans, on March 20. It was used to celebrate the Spring Equinox, also known as the beginning of the Spring season. 

Ostara was a fertility goddess who was celebrated by the growth of new life. This included the growing of trees and babies. The connection between Jesus Christ’s resurrection and Ostara’s focus on the growth of new life is quite similar. The name “Easter” also comes from “Ostara.” Don’t believe it? Say “Ostara” three times fast. Sounds like “Easter,” right? 
Ostara is not a forgotten deity in mainstream culture. She has become a staple in the new TV show American Gods. Here she is showing off her Spring powers:

Now the bunny and eggs have always seemed odd. But looking back at the Ostara celebration it makes sense. The bunny, because of its high reproductive rate, was seen as Ostara’s sacred animal. She also gave a special bunny the power to lay multicolored eggs. Children would also present eggs to the goddess to as a sign of fidelity. Ostara was so delighted by it she would have her bunny minions return the eggs in baskets to the children. Sounds pretty familiar. 

How did the ritual get adopted by Christianity? First, priests who were trying to convert pagan children would offer money for the eggs, which evolved into the finding of eggs for treats – Easter egg hunts. It also seemed to be a tactic used for conversion. Instead of trying to force an entirely new system of belief, they would modify existing rituals to relate them to Christianity, such as Christmas.
So, if you are celebrating Ostara on March 20 or Easter on April 1, know that there are more similarities than you may think.

If someone told you they were a Wiccan what would be your first reaction? Would you roll your eyes? Make a joke about Harry Potter or being a witch? Do you do the same when someone says they are a Christian?
Wiccans can have a difficult time being taken seriously by mainstream culture. When Wicca is mentioned on news organizations, people snicker or treat it as phony or illegitimate. Watch this segment on Fox News:

Even though Tucker Carlson later apologized, it demonstrates how little respect the organization gets. There are numerous articles online about how to deal with people acting rudely when you mention you are a Wiccan. 
Why does this occur? 
First, when we think of Wiccans we get images of witchcraft, which society has never been comfortable with. We used to burn women as witches and believed them to be engaging in evil acts. The Salem Witch Trials and Spanish Inquisition are parts of our history. Interestingly enough, the claim that Wiccans are devil worshipers cannot be more untrue. The devil is part of the Christian faith, not Wicca and so it is not a part of their worship. 
The media portrayal of witches has also been mostly one-sided. When we think of movies like Hocus Pocus, Witches, or the recent critically-acclaimed The Witch we conjure images of women eating children, turning people into frogs, and casting spells over a boiling cauldron. 

Which is part of the problem. There is something inherently sexist about the portrayal of witches. When you think about male magic users, Gandalf, Harry Potter, or Doctor Strange come to mind. Perhaps the use of magic by women, essentially the ability to change what is the natural order, seems like a dangerous proposition to male-dominated societies.
But it could also be misinformation. Wicca is a relatively new belief system when the phrase was first coined in 1954 by Gerald Gardner. It has no central book and the belief system is defined by the individual. Some worship in groups, called covens, while others worship alone. The central belief in spirituality and the unity of the Divine means that different deities are honored. There is also no inherent rule about proselytizing. Wiccans, as a general rule, do not go out to convert but believe in the spiritual journey being just that, a journey. And one that must be taken by each individual. This means there is less interaction with Wiccans and their communities, even though there are a number of examples of Wiccans being involved in civic and charitable causes.
Part of it could be because of the belief in magic. But most major religions have supernatural elements: resurrection, divine power, people talking to their deities or representatives. Vice President Pence has stated that Jesus talks to him. When Joy Behar of The View called it delusional, there was widespread criticism of her for violating his religious beliefs. This should be the same when criticizing a Wiccan for using spells. Everyone’s personal beliefs should be respected, not just the ones that are more mainstream. 
Wiccans are one of the fastest growing religions in the United States. There has been an estimated growth from 134,000 to 2,000,000 in less than 15 years. It could be because of what the Wiccan faith espouses: love of family, appreciation for both the spiritual and the physical, and respect for the environment. The freedom it entails could be seen as a potent alternative to religions with strict doctrine and sometimes is not always clear. For example, very few Christians follow all the rules of the Bible, including the Old Testament. A television show is on currently about how difficult and archaic it is to follow it in the modern world. 
Respect for other religions does not mean you have to follow them. You can think that they are strange or stupid. Religious freedom is allowing others to practice their faith in any way they see fit as long as it does not cause harm to others or society. And it does mean keeping an open mind because the essence of a liberal society is one that both acknowledges and tolerates the thoughts of others.

The concept of witchcraft has existed in divergent cultures for thousands of years. In China, a new study is demonstrating that the belief not only continues but has huge consequences for rural China.
A witch is labeled a Zhu. They are mostly accused of poisoning others in the village. The vast majority of those that are accused of being a witch are middle-aged women that are the head of the households. A study of 800 households found that 13% or 104 households had been labeled a Zhu.

The consequences of being a Zhu are ostracization from the village. One of the beliefs about Zhu is that it can be passed through the trading or giving of material objects. Therefore, members of the village will not trade with them. Zhu are also believed to poison food or spread misfortune by eye contact, and so social interaction with them is avoided. Since over 80% of rural Chinese never leave their town, the stigma of being labeled a witch can become generational. Since there are over 600 million Chinese that live in rural areas, there could be an untold number of families and women that are affected. 
The study gives two major reasons why the belief in witches still exists. The first is that it is used to point out members of a society that are uncooperative or fit outside the norm. Interestedly, rather than bind a community together it creates mistrust and paranoia that disrupt social dynamics. 
The second reason is the takeover of a matriarchal micro-community by patriarchal institutions. This would explain why female heads of households are targeted. Because female institutions of power could be seen as alternatives to a male system of control for the towns a way to disrupt this is to put these female members outside the community.

It is illegal in China to accuse anyone of witchcraft. This does not seem to change rural town behavior and the study does not show whether legal means are being used to diminish these allegations.

The decision passed by India’s top court last week gave approval to passive euthanasia. This is the practice of withholding treatment that is essential to life for a terminally ill individual. A constitution bench of five judges led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Kumar Misra made the order into law. The bench set some guidelines to the permission of passive euthanasia.
The Supreme Court said that “living will” would be allowed only after permission is obtained from the family of the patient who seeks passive euthanasia. In addition to that, a team of expert doctors would also need to reach a conclusion that the said individual cannot be revived.
Jains believe in sallekhana, the very holy right of fasting to death. According to the Jain religion, the rite can free one’s soul from the endless cycle of birth and death, reincarnation. In the religion, a Jain is allowed to undertake sallekhana if they are suffering from an incurable disease or the devastation of old age. Before they can go through the death fast, they get permission from a senior monk. A Jain is not allowed to go through sallekhana if they have worldly responsibilities like children to care for. During sallekhana, the Jain gives up food and drink.  He or she focuses on prayer and fasting until their death. They then receive a special funeral.
The allowance of passive euthanasia, although controversial, is celebrated in the Jain religion.

A Diksha ceremony was recently held in Mumbai in which 16 men and women took the Jain Vow of renunciation. The ceremony was held at the Shimpoli Cricket Ground in Borivali, Mumbai. These successful individuals, aged between 14 and 45, ten under age 30, gave up all their worldly possessions for a life of severe hardship, that of Jain asceticism.
The ceremony sees the attendance of thousands of members of the Jain community such as Hemant Shah, a 64-year-old newly retired businessman from Canada who works closely with the presiding guru of the ceremony, Acharya Yugbhushan Suri Maharaj (known as Pandit Maharaj). Families and friends were also in attendance to see their loved ones ceremoniously become diksharthis, monks and nuns of Jainism. 
The ceremony kicked off with the closest kin taking all possessions such as jewelry from the renunciants. The final ceremonial rites were performed by the kin and entailed shaving and showering their loved one for the last time, as from then on they would only sponge-bathe.

After this, the dikshar returned to the stage where they were received with joy by the audience. With their shaved heads and white clothing, the sixteen took their vows of renunciation and assumed their new identities. They were presented with new belongings for their new life – a walking stick, a bowl, and a white square cloth to sit on. The Pandit Maharaj gave every dikshar a new title, marking a new beginning and identity. The Jain monks and nuns would travel across cities on foot except in monsoon months, pluck their hair out strand-by-strand (an agonizing exercise called kaya klesh), and scavenge for food.
The millennial Jain monks and nuns have joined the journey of a community of an estimated 16,000 Jain ascetics. They now live on five basic vows (mahavratas): detachment (aparigraha), celibacy (brahmacharya), not stealing (achaurya), truth (satya), and non-violence (ahimsa). They will not hold bank accounts but will be catered for by the Jain community through the organization Jain International Trade Organization (JITO).

For over 2,000 years, the religion of Jainism has attracted millions of followers in India and across the rest of the world. September marks one of the most important festivals of their calendar, the festival of Paryushan. From August 18 – 25, Jains take the time to reflect on their inner being , and engage in fasting to help give them a deeper sense of inner peace.
The festival itself is rooted in India’s agricultural practices centuries ago. After the Indian monsoon season, there was little for the country’s farmers to do during this time and there was also a great number of insects brought by the rains. The rains made traveling by road difficult and Jainism teaches that it is wrong to kill any living creature. People therefore tended to stay in their own villages, and from this the practice of Paryushan emerged. 
During the 8-10 day period, Jains will fast in order to completely focus their minds on soul searching. Jainism is known for its strict rules and moral code, which are extremely difficult to live on a daily basis. During Paryusham, Jains will therefore reflect on their conduct over the past year, ask for forgiveness, and clear their spirit for the future. Materialism is put aside, and Jains instead remember that the attainment of Nirvana is what they should be concentrating on. 
Paryushan is also a time for people to come together and celebrate. Over the course of these holy weeks, wealth and social status are put aside, and Jains come together as one. Jains believe that “All life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence.” During this time, all Jains will focus particularly on upholding the welfare of all living things, and feeling a deeper bond with both their fellow human beings and nature in general. 
Wishing everyone celebrating Paryushana a wonderful journey of self-upliftmentEven those celebrating it for #weightloss
— Saket Tawde (@SaketTawde) August 20, 2017

Many Jains will fast for eight days during Paryushan. Others will only fast for three days, representing the Three Jewels of Jainism, right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. However, most Jains will try to avoid eating after sunset, where more insects may be present but cannot be easily spotted on food. They also avoid root vegetables, since harvesting these destroys the entire plant.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced on March 26 it is in the process of making considerable changes to its abuse guidelines policy. This change was a knee-jerk reaction after scores of women alleged LDS church leaders encouraged them to stay in sexually abusive or physically demeaning relationships. The First Presidency of the Church mentioned in the announcement that the church leaders' hearts and prayers remain with those members who are affected due to this severe problem.
The revised guidelines predominantly deal with how the church's local leaders should manage abuse reports and the one-on-one meetings they have with youth. An important new rule allows children to bring an adult or parent with them during their one-on-one interviews with bishops. Parents until now were permitted to sit in the adjacent room. The label “bishop” is applied to local church leaders in the Mormon church. However, if a youth wants, then that individual could still give the interview alone. 
The new guidelines also state that church members must not be pushed to stay in any situation or a home which to them is an unsafe or an abusive one. Mormon clergy are now instructed to listen to every abuse allegation and not ignore them. They are also not to instruct a member to stop from reporting any kind of criminal activity to the relevant law enforcement personnel. The official statement from the church said that the letter and resource document sent on March 26 is a component of the ongoing effort to teach leaders. The document is the latest version of the 2008 guidelines. The letter was signed by Russell M. Nelson, the church President. There were two co-signers: Henry B. Eyring and Dallin H. Oaks, both Presidents and counselors.
BREAKING: @LDSchurch revises church guidelines on preventing and responding to abuse in the wake of the #josephbishop case. https://t.co/BsD3RWJyO5
— Chris Jones (@jonesnews) March 26, 2018

This announcement came days after a sexual assault accusation was made against Joseph Bishop, the former MTC president. Tiffany Turley, the BYU Title IX Coordinator, said that she appreciates the Mormon church's new emphasis on stopping abuse. She opined that the latest endeavors of the LDS church are more policy emphasis than policy change. Bishop Jim Stone of Provo YSA 138th Ward fully supports these changes. He said that all members must be as comfortable as possible. He also said that although it is good to have a trusted person present in meetings, it is sometimes more comfortable to go alone.

Ongoing debates on net neutrality open the war between the open source, free access advocates, and the private forces or commercial interests present within the web. It was simply a matter of time when one battle spilled over into the net's biblical realm known as '.bible' domain.  A few Bible scholars have accused American Bible Society (ABS) for arbitrarily restricting the usage of this top level domain. The company secured its contract to manage it as an administrator in 2013.
ABS have no similar competition for the .bible domain. It has partnered with several other Christian organizations to be the entity responsible for registering the .bible websites. This task, the company said, is the continuation of its 200-year mission to promote the Bible among the masses.
ABS registered itself as a nonprofit. It takes a different approach when it comes to its role. The .bible venture is representative of the 21st century extension of the continuing advocacy of the Bible and biblical resources. Geof Morin, the senior vice president of ABS for ministry mobilization, said they use the domain to facilitate a trusted online space creation. This would be for those who want to engage with all things biblical. He added that the American Bible Society fully supports the free flow of ideas and information, but the ABS wants the website content located on .bible to harbor a healthy respect when it comes to the Holy Book.
ABS has put together several conditions linked to respect towards Christian religious views and the Bible. The list includes its stated mission to promote Bible community with its causes, perspectives, interests, admirers, positions and supporters.
After a meeting with critics in January where they have expressed concern that the policy restricted the use of non-Christians and secular scholars of '.bible' domain, the guidelines were expanded by ABS to make sure the domain would be available to those wanting to engage with the Christian Scriptures in constructive ways.
The list of critics included John Kutsko, the executive director of Society of Biblical Literature. The latter is the biggest and the oldest learned society engaged in the Bible's critical investigation. The Society has approximately 8,500 members, with a major chunk of them being scholars. Marc Zvi Brettler, a professor of Jewish studies at Duke University said, “The Bible has never belonged to one group alone. Its internet namesake shouldn’t either.”

The woman was ambushed by a man and a woman wielding samurai-style swords as she was leaving her car. Her driver was also attacked by non-life threatening injuries. The attackers have turned out to be her brother, Shigenaga Tomioka, and his wife. Shigenaga killed his sister then murdered his wife, before committing suicide.
In a case of bitter irony, the Shinto shrine, one of 82,000 sites around Japan, was established in the 17th century to worship the god Hachiman, the god of martial arts and war. 
What was the motive? A long-standing family feud about control of the shrine. Female priests are rare in Japan. Only about 10% of the Shinto shrines have female priests. Usually, the priesthood is passed from father to son. Shigenaga was originally the head priest of the shrine but was fired in 2001, possibly for financial difficulties. The feud was extreme enough that Shigenaga had sent death threats to his sister and Nagako had sought help from the police.  
The Tomioka Hacimangu shrine is a considerably famous Shinto shrine, with a long-standing connection to the family. It is closely linked to sumo wrestling and has been recently visited by the royal family. 
It is unclear if there was a recent event that caused the attack and if suicide was part of the plan. It was clearly planned out given that the assailants had been laying in wait for the victim.
There has not been a statement from the site nor the family.

Japanese social media went aflutter when one person posted a photo of a large poster installed at the Koura Grand Shrine  located in Fukuoka, Kyushu. At first glance, the Shinto shrine appears to solicit applications for male shrine maidens. This is unusual as although shrines frequently hire part-time groundskeepers and sales assistants, especially during the peak holiday season, hiring male shrine maidens are unheard of. There is a cultural aspect to this hiring-it is believed this action brings with it good luck.
The sign at the Koura Grand Shrine informed the reader that it is recruiting shrine maidens and without any gap, male staff. The absence of punctuation made many readers assume that the shrine wishes to appoint a male shrine maiden with a love of cross-dressing. This is not a far-fetched idea as a number of shrines cater to anime fans with phone accessories made in the shrine maiden moe-style. It is natural that almost an equal number of the audience were excited and perplexed.
Mikos has generally served as shrine mediums, shamans, ritual dancers, and spirit mediums. They are involved in religious duties independently of affiliation with any specific shrine. During Japan's past, they used to travel around the country performing what was then thought of as magic. They assisted in religious prayers. The Mikos are often unmarried virgins serving as vehicles for the divine revelations. Their present role in 21st century Japan is much fewer. Their duties are mostly confined to helping the male priests. They also clean the temple compound and sell amulets at shrine shop. Women can apply and train to be a Shinto priest. No special certifications are needed for this job.
The more logical section of the Japanese public was quick to point out the obvious: the advertisement was most likely for hiring shrine maidens and also male workers for part-time positions. Some of the more grammatically correct among them went to the shrine's web page. Their suspicions were soon confirmed. The shrine has actually advertised for two posts.
Anime fans are disappointed as they will not see any guy tooled up in Miko apparel in 2017. The idea, however, has now germinated inside their heads and thus there are hopes for future developments. Whatever happens, those who want to see themselves in priestess wear could buy online from traders who know exactly what customers want.

Milan Fashion Week, Gucci’s show was one of the weirdest displays one could imagine.  Some models walked the ramp while carrying their amputated heads, while others had baby dragons with them. There were even models who had third eyes, which is extremely strange from the Italian luxury designer brand.
If you thought those were the only accessories that seemed out of place, you should have taken a look at the headwear. Models were seen wearing turbans, babushka headscarves, and hijabs. Sikh organizations and commentators criticized the Italian brand for using their religion’s traditional headpiece inappropriately.
Avan Jogia, the Canadian model and actor, posted a tweet regarding the recent fashion show that took place, “could you not find a brown model?” He posted his tweet along with a white model wearing a blue turban.
Yo.. @gucci … I mess with you guys… but this isn't a good look for you… could you not find a brown model? pic.twitter.com/INqxwrfB0t
— Avan Jogia (@AvanJogia) February 22, 2018

Even though Avan isn’t a Sikh himself, he wasn’t happy with the way Gucci used religious turbans as a fashion accessory. After seeing his tweet, several others joined in, calling Gucci “irresponsible” and “offensive.”
The Sikh Coalition civil rights group from New York posted the following tweet, ""The Sikh turban is a sacred article of faith, @gucci, not a mere fashion accessory. #appropriation. We are available for further education and consultation if you are looking for observant Sikh models.""
One Twitter user, kingkang3211 had an interesting opinion about Gucci’s take on the turban. He said that even though Sikhs are proud to wear turbans, they face discrimination due to the headwear. He was displeased over the fact that Gucci didn’t use a Sikh man to be one of the models for the turban, even though they had the option.
Wearing a turban as a Sikh makes me smile, privileged & truly honoured. People across the globe battle issues & get bullied because of it. @gucci used the beautiful turban as a fashion accessory, the question remains why a Sikh man couldn’t model for them? We have so many Singhs pic.twitter.com/obqZcZPDcz
— kingkang (@kingkang3211) February 23, 2018

Another person, gurpycolors said that Gucci should have used the turban appropriately. The user made a statement that Sikhs get discriminated for wearing turbans. However, when worn by a white person, it gets accepted and becomes fashionable.
This is unacceptable and offensive @gucci. Wearing another religions article of faith is not fashion, its appropriation! Sikh men are profiled and discriminated against every day for wearing a turban, yet when you put in on a white person, it’s suddenly fashionable and cool?!?! pic.twitter.com/UD0wWjaju5
— Gurpy Colors o(:) (@gurpycolors) February 22, 2018

Harjinder Singh Kukreja, a restauranteur from India, took to Twitter to inform Gucci that turbans are not meant to be fashion accessories as they are religious items. He said that the models wore the turbans as hats, unlike Sikhs who tie the headpiece meticulously.
Recently, a Sikh man was a victim of a racist attack when an attacker ripped his turban and commented, ""Muslim go back home.&quot
Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, in a press release explained the bizarre fashion show. According to Gucci, their latest collection draws inspiration from Donna Haraway’s cyborg philosophy. The show attempts to be on the “abnormal” side by using cultural symbols on models. Regardless of the philosophy, the Sikhs were unhappy with Gucci’s decision.
At this point I’m convinced Gucci and LV are low key EXO stans 🤭 #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #Exol

The Mayor of Hoboken, Ravi Bhalla, has revealed that death threats were issued to him. The threats targeted his family as well. Bhalla is only three months into his Mayorship. He discussed on the subject of threats through a statement that was given by his office post a security breach at the City Hall in Hoboken on February 15. The police subsequently investigated this incident. No one was hurt. The City of New Jersey contacted the Joint Terrorism Task Force to do a thorough check over the existing security procedures. Bhalla said the incident, combined with death threats made to him and his family confirmed the need to take security as a serious issue.
The statement by Mayor Bhalla of Hoboken begins with the sentence that the incident which happened at the office of the Mayor on February 15 is being investigated by Hoboken Police Department. According to eye-witnesses and as per the always watchful eyes of the office cameras, a yet unidentified person entered the City Hall building a little before eight in the night. The person entered via the entrance on Newark Street around eight in the night. He was passed through the metal detectors. The individual told security personnel that he intends to take advantage of the restroom facilities.
Since it was after office hours, the building was thinly populated. Jason Freeman, the Deputy Chief of Staff, was the only person from the Mayoral office present at that time. Mayor Bhalla still had not reached his office after attending a community meeting. Deputy Chief Freeman spied that person throwing a bag in the direction where the desk of the administrative assistant was. He and the individual made eye contact. The person then fled from the office of the mayor. The police were subsequently called for by Freeman. The incident is currently being investigated by the police.
The office of the Mayor was trying to implement the recommendations given by the task force for both physical change and procedural changes so that security can be improved in the City Hall premises. Hoboken law enforcement declined to respond to media questioning about the incident. Mayor Bhalla, in his email, said that it was not possible for him and his office to release further information as a number of active investigations are presently underway by multiple law enforcement agencies.

Gurjeet Singh just thought he was picking up another Uber passenger. He ended up having a gun pointed to his head after a male passenger demanded to know what country he was from and being told he “hated turban people.”
Mr. Singh is just one of many American Sikhs who have experienced hate crimes. Since 9/11 the number of attacks against Sikhs has vastly increased. Many Sikhs have reported feeling a general state of unease and feel that their life is threatened.
The reason male Sikhs are targeted is that they are religiously mandated to wear turbans and are not allowed to trim their beard. This has created mistaken identity where individuals think they are targeting Muslims but are actually attacking Sikhs. It spiked the greatest the month after 9/11 where there were over 300 reported instances of attacks on Sikhs. 
While the sheriff is looking for the suspect and Uber has suspended his account he continues to remain at large. The fact that Mr. Singh, a religious leader in his community, was a victim of religious violence is appalling. The fact that it occurs because of a general confusion over Islamophobia is depressing. A majority of Americans have stated that they know nothing about Sikhs. There are over 25 million Sikhs in the world and over 1 million in the United States.
There has been no plan put out by the Trump Administration to combat violence against Sikhs.

Valarie Kaur, an experienced interfaith organizer and a lawyer by profession, holds the belief that love can be more than a personal and intense feeling. She says that other than bonding two humans together, it is also a potent force for delivering social justice. To buttress her argument, Kaur shows the examples of Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi. She claimed that all three utilized love to fuel their social movements.
The campaign of #ReclaimLove. Kaur claims is “cultural intervention”. The purpose of this action is to unite a fractured America. She said that 2017 was a year of executive orders given without thought. There were bans on Muslims, hate crimes, pipelines, border walls, and cuts to the budget. For people who love justice, this is the time to exhibit resistance through love. If no resistance is given, then loving peaceful Americans will either burn out or be the same thing which they want to resist in the first place.
For Kaur, her activism began a number of years ago. She experienced deep personal pain when Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed in the course of a hate crime after the terrorist attacks on September 11. Sodhi was a close family friend. This injustice pushed the California native Kaur to find out ways of increasing solidarity and interfaith understanding. 
Kaur on February 14 teamed up with a number of other like-minded activists to start a particular social media effort. She hopes that this will encourage individuals to get back love and use it as a good resource in an increasingly polarized world. She has taken the assistance of others who like her wants to subdue to a horrific rise of hate and white nationalism during the Trump presidency. Prominent individuals in this group include Van Jones, the CNN host who also founded #LoveArmy, the activist organization, the Women’s March, and the Our Three Winners. The last is a foundation made in honor of three Muslim students shot dead during a Chapel Hill shooting spree in North Carolina, 2015.
Kaur’s efforts have found lots of support in Social Media. The hashtag #ReclaimLove has been posted with art, pictures, videos, and music. It has only one everything override topic: how can love be reclaimed as a public ethics? If this is done, love becomes a revolutionary force. New sign-ups are being sent as a social media kit.

Preet Didbal, as the newly anointed Mayor of Yuba City, created history as the town's first Sikh woman to hold this office.  Sutter County-the place she was elected from- has one of the biggest community of Sikhs in the United States. The religion has its origins in the Punjab region of India.
When the event is seen on the basis of religion, Didbal's appointment was not a big deal. The U.S. has a number of Sikh mayors. In fact, December saw another Sikh mayor, Ravi Bhalla, being elected in Hoboken, New Jersey. Didbal is, however, the pioneer among Sikh women to be elected to a Mayoral position. According to the Sikh Coalition, about 500,000 Sikhs reside in the United States, and the event of a Sikh mayor is a momentous decision for them. Jaydeep Singh, a member of the coalition, said he was happy to see a person who looked like him hold public office in the U.S.
Didbal was born and raised in Yuba City. She was the daughter of farmers who emigrated from India during the latter part of the 1960s. She was the first member of her family to complete her higher studies and gain a college degree. Didbal also did get her masters. She was also the first city council member as a Sikh woman in 2014.
Didbal is candid about her past. She readily talks about picking peaches in the fields with her parents. There were also confessions about overcoming the various cultural barriers encountered by the women in the Sikh community. It was at this time during the media interview that the subject of her being raped when she was a young woman came up.
Didbal did not allow the trauma of rape to affect her career. She studied hard to get a bachelor's qualification and then a master's of business administration (MBA) to get a succession of jobs.  The first job was at Department of Corrections administered by the state government. She then got a posting at State Compensation Insurance Fund. In 2014, she got elected to Yuba City council. She is now 49 years old. The mayoral post is elected every year by a council staffed by five members.
#RepresentationMatters Preet Didbal, a rape survivor, wants to use her position to bring women together. #INSPIRED https://t.co/IMqoFtAWew
— Michael MacRae (@MichaelJMacRae) December 10, 2017

When asked about what she will do now as she is mayor, Didbal said that pensions continue to be her biggest concern. She wants to foster increased economic growth. The roads will be expanded from the present two lanes to four lanes.

The spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, has canceled all travel for the rest of the year. This has made Buddhists nervous.
Representatives of the holy man have stated that it is more about exhaustion then it is about his health. However, the Dalai Lama has decreased his country visits for the past three years and is 82-years-old. 

There are some real dangers to Tibetan Buddhism of the Dalai Lama having a decreased international presence. The Dalai Lama’s public exposure and charismatic personality has been a boost to conversion to Buddhism all over the globe. In addition, he has spent much of his public exposure to advocate for the independence of Tibet from Chinese rule. China took over Tibet in 1959, forcing the Dalai Lama into his exile since. 

This could have two effects. It could stop the pressure for China to give any autonomy to the Tibetan people. Even more frightening is the possibility of violence occurring. Many Tibetans have threatened violence if China does not give more rights. Some experts believe the Dalai Lama speaking out against violence has been the main reason why it has not occurred. If the Dalai Lama decreases public appearances or becomes ill it could be a catalyst for a possible uprising in Tibet.
Only time will tell how the decreased travel schedule will affect Tibet Buddhism. Although, foreign leaders have traveled to see the Dalai Lama, meaning that he could to petition for political changes while able to rest.

Pali language specialist and renowned Buddhist scholar Steven Collins passed away  on February 15 in New Zealand. The 66-year-old was leading a seminar during that time. It has been ascertained his death was due to natural causes. Collins was an illustrious academician: he was a Chester D. Tripp Professor in the Humanities. He also chaired the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations multiple times after he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1991. He was also a member of the Divinity School's associate faculty.

Collins' peers were fulsome in their praises. Whitney Cox, chair and the associate professor of South Asian Languages and Civilizations, holds the view that the departed academic can be regarded as one of most distinguished historians when it comes to the present crop of academicians. He held great erudition in premodern Southern Asia.
Other than academics, Collins was also popular in personal life. Cox said, “He was perhaps the single most sheerly intelligent person I’ve ever known, a great citizen of the University, and a wise and compassionate teacher and friend.” The recently deceased academic was described by many as a loving father, grandfather and as a devoted husband. He was a fan of John Coltrane and Miles Davis. His soccer loyalties stood with Tottenham Hotspur.
Desperately sad news about the sudden demise of titan of Buddhist philosophy, Steven Collins.
— Gary Donnelly (@babblist) February 16, 2018

Daniel Arnold, the associate professor of Divinity School of the University of Chicago, recounted a “transformative” realization when he read Selfless Persons at the time he was in graduate college. He later went on to be a colleague of Collins. Arnold considered him as a friend. “I will miss many things after his tragically untimely passing. May all who of us who learned from his exemplary intellectual engagement strive to continue bringing something of this lost clarity of thought to a world badly in need of it,” said Arnold.
Collins leaves behind his wife, also an academician and children along with grandchildren.

A fire has blazed through Lhasa’s Jokhang Temple , with the flames licking the gilded roof. It is also reported that the fire was swiftly brought under control. As per existing reports, the health of the population was not affected by the fire. The exiled Tibetan Government said that the main chapel, a 1,300-year-old structure, was unaffected. The central part of the Jokhang Chapel has a number of Tibetan artifacts of high cultural value. One of them is Jowo Sakyamuni, a statue built into the life size of Buddha when the latter was 12-years-old.
Jokhang Temple is one the most important and sacred sites in Tibet. The temple witnesses many Buddhist pilgrims prostrating in front, a tradition which began in the seventh century.
Chinese social media showed the roof engulfed by large flames. The blaze happened when most Tibetans were busy celebrating Losar, the Tibetan festival celebrating the new year. Festivities began February 16. The cause of this fire remains to be ascertained.

Chinese authorities already imposed a censorship on the news. News of the fire and related to it online are being scrubbed by Beijing. This is as Tibet's political status continues to be a sensitive issue. Travelers to the region face extreme bureaucratic hurdles. News concerning the region is frequently subjected to censorship.
Prime Minister Lobsang Sangay of the Tibetan government-in-exile expressed relief that the fire did not spread to the Jokhang chapel. He is presently in Japan visiting the country. He, however, urged Tibetans who continued to live in Tibet to be alert during big public gatherings. This precaution must be followed especially during occasions like Losar. He said that it is compulsory to put in sufficient safety measures at holy places like Jokhang. The Tibetan minister for culture and also religion, Ven Karma Gelek Yuthok, said that he cannot comment much as he still has to get reasons as to how the fire started, the government-in-exile minister said that it is disturbing for him to see any number of tragic accidents which take place near the Jokhang temple premises.

An apology was made to China by the vehicle maker Mercedes-Benz for quoting the Dalai Lama in a promotional Instagram post.  The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader is deemed dangerous and reviled by Beijing. 
Mercedes-Benz deleted the post and issued and apologized through its official Weibo post. The Mercedes-Benz reaction shows that foreign companies are becoming increasingly wary of any damage done to their reputation if they misstep on any sensitive political issue.
The reason for all this heartburn was a promotional hashtagged “MondayMotivation” Instagram post. The post featured a white car manufactured by the company and a quote from the Dalai Lama that read, “Look at the situations from all angles, and you will become more open.” It exhorted the reader to look at any situation from multiple angles. An individual will become more open if this is done.
Mercedes-Benz is not the only company to fall afoul of the Chinese authorities. Beijing has earlier strongly criticized Marriott, the luxury hotel chain, and the Zara fashion brand, along with a number of other companies for terming Hong Kong and Taiwan separate countries in its promotional materials and websites.
Foreign brands are desperate to woo the increasingly prosperous Chinese consumer. However, many Chinese buyers and regulators are found to be willing to challenge the selling brands over what the Chinese Governments regard as inappropriate.

Germany's Daimler issues 'full apology' to China over Dalai Lama https://t.co/9J4CyC8VbF

Daimler AG, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, did not mention the Dalai Lama in its apology. Simonette Illi, the spokeswoman for the company in Beijing, said that the company has not heard anything about the issue from the Chinese authorities. In their statement, the company promised to take action to deepen the knowledge about Chinese culture and its values.
When reporters asked Illi whether Daimler will design international marketing brochures with Chinese sensitivities in mind she said, “What we are striving for is that, as we are a globally active company, we establish an understanding for cultural tolerance.” 
The Chinese Government rejects all accusations concerning human rights. It does not brook any external interference in its affairs. Ironically, Beijing demands governments of other nations to bow to the Chinese diktat.

Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, the detestable, egotistical weatherman in Groundhog Day. The 1993 film shows Murray repeatedly experiencing a single day multiple times. Although the movie belongs to the comedy genre, a substantial number of religious scholars regard the film as a kind of below-the-surface Buddhist classic. They believe the film depicts the endless loop of death and consequent rebirth. Connors breaks the cycle via personal redemption. The metaphor can belong to any religion, Buddhism, Christianity or even in secular thought. The concept can be applied to how a person spends his or her every day.
It is not surprising that Groundhog Day has become a cult classic. It is a movie which makes people laugh and a movie that provides snapshots of life’s many meanings. Critics knowledgeable about Buddhist philosophy have described the movie as “Buddish.” Harold Ramis, the director of the film coined this term. According to him, this one word summed up his entire belief system. He was influenced by Buddhist concepts as one of his close friends and mother-in-law were Zen Buddhists. He described the religion as a simple and memorable one, with no requirement of articles of faith. Buddhism, he claims, is totally humanistic from every way. 

According to Dan Arnold of Divinity School, although the concept of having repeated chances towards life could seem like a blessing, the “Samsara” concept in Buddhism could actually be nearer to punishment. The philosophy professor of religions pointed out that in the Indian religious sphere, continuous rebirth is a problem that should be solved. The idea is that the rebirth concept is actually suffering.
In Groundhog Day, the sarcastic Phil Connors repeatedly wakes the same day. Phil, a groundhog, and the weatherman’s namesake sees the man’s shadow, and scurries back into his burrow, implying six weeks of winter to come. Connors get frustrated by going through the same day. He desperately wants to go somewhere and find new circumstances. His escape strategies included different scenarios. The character goes after sex, and sometime later that gets boring too. Engaging in crime comes next and that also becomes boring. All other options, drinking, suicide, and therapy were also explored. 
The film mirrors Buddhist practices. In real life, we follow near identical schedules. Although the routine is the same, each moment is unique. It is important to note that Phil Connors breaks the samsara cycle when he does not try anymore. This enables him to enjoy true participation and true enjoyment. Every moment of his day becomes meaningful.

An elderly woman who once escaped the Nazis ended up murdered in her Paris home due to anti-Semitic sentiments. The body of Mireille Knoll, 85, was discovered on March 23 inside her 11th Arrondissement apartment. She was stabbed to death. The killer then tried to set fire to her apartment. As per the statement released by the Paris prosecutor, anti-Semitism was the motivation.
Two men have already been caught and jailed in this case. They were handed a list of preliminary charges which includes murder for anti-Semitic motives, robbery, and property damage. Francis Kalifat, President of CRIF, a Jewish group, said the elderly woman was stabbed a horrific 11 times.
Of the two men arrested for the attack, one of them is her neighbor, a man 27-years-old. He was previously incarcerated for sexual assault. He had attacked the daughter of the domestic helper who Knoll employed in her residence. The other attacker is a 21-year-old homeless man with a history of violence. The police have not released their names due to legal restrictions. Both of them are indicted on charges of voluntary homicide due to the supposed or even true religion of victim, and theft compounded by three circumstances. The last charge is degradation of others’ property through dangerous means. 
Knoll’s death and the supposed motive behind her murder is beyond tragic as she escaped persecution during the Nazi occupation of France. She was a child in 1942, when the French police, who were then cooperating with the Germans, gathered up thousands of French Jews and gathered all of them into Velodrome d’Hiver, the cycling stadium. All of them were later slaughtered at Auschwitz.  Knoll’s mother could only escape with her daughter as she was a citizen of Brazil. 
For France, this horrific incident is the latest of many anti-Semitic crimes. Sarah Halimi, a Jewish elderly woman was murdered in 2017 by a man who shouted an Islamic chant prior to pushing her out of the window. The anger of French Jews towards this 2017 crime prompted the French authorities to swiftly classify the murder of Knoll as a hate crime. The 2017 crime was labeled anti-Semitic only after many months of legal struggles. 
There have been marches in support of Mrs. Knoll and against anti-Semitism across France.

British Jews are reacting to the latest incident of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party. The incident also witnessed Corbyn express his regret for apparently showing his support for Mear One, who crafted an anti-Semitic mural in 2012. As per Jewish leaders, the row over this mural is simply the latest evidence that the Labour Party is incapable of contemplating anti-Semitism. The reason is that the party is so much ideologically attached with a far-left view of the world which is naturally hostile to the mainstream Jewish communities.
The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews urged their supporters to put on a show of solidarity. The event will take place outside Parliament as the Labour MPs hold their scheduled weekly meeting. Corbyn will not attend the meeting. 
The mural at the center of the storm depicts a cluster of white businessmen along with Jewish financiers playing a game, believed to be Monopoly, on a board. The board game is being played on the backs of people. The mural also includes another feature, subsequently removed by the Tower Hamlets Council after it received numerous complaints, where an activist held a banner. The banner had a sentence which read: ""The new world order is the enemy of humanity.""
Corbyn commented on the Facebook account of Mear One, whose real name is Kalen Ockerman when the artist revealed that his work is scheduled to be whitewashed. The 2012 comment read that the artist is not alone in this predicament. The Labour Party chief pointed out that Diego Viera's mural was destroyed by Rockefeller as it had Lenin's picture.

Other than the mural, Jonathan Goldstein, chairman, Jewish Leadership Council, and Jonathan Arkush, president, Board of Deputies, claim that Corbyn is friends with Hamas and Hezbollah. They also cited his opposition to extradition of Raed Salah, the controversial Muslim cleric.
Jeremy Corbyn was right to apologise over the mural. Labour is also right to crack down on anti-Semitism wherever it manifests (and it *must*).
The attempts to smear Corbyn personally with anti-Semitism are also wholly false. Read this by @joseph_finlay > https://t.co/i21C67WjqE

Russian ice cream company has attracted the wrath of the Jewish community, especially in the Tatarstan region of Russia, after the launch of its latest product. Located in Naberezhnye Chelny, a city which is 600 miles away from Moscow, the Slavitsa-based company announced that it is expanding its range of products, by releasing a new ice cream cone.
However, the company’s decision didn’t go well with the Jewish community, who were on the receiving end. The company’s latest ice cream cone uses an Israeli flag on its wrapper, which is drawing a lot of negative publicity. On top of that, the company named their new ice cream “Poor Jews.”
The leader of Naberezhnye Chelny’s Jewish community, Leonid Shteinberg, wasn’t happy with the company’s new ice cream cone. He told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty he found the ice cream cone to be racist because of its name. He also asked for intervention to stop the sale and production of this demeaning product.
Shteinberg was shocked by the fact that the company went ahead with the decision to name its product “Poor Jews.” He asked the company, “…where did they ever see a poor Jew?”

The city prosecutor made a statement that it will look into the complaints officially. The office will launch an investigation to see if the company used the Israeli flag and name legally.
In the company’s social media post February 28, they described the product as prune and chocolate flavored ice cream with peanut toppings. 
“Trying all this tastiness, it turns out that he is not so ‘poor,'” the post proclaimed.

However, this isn’t the first time this company has found itself in hot water. The company made the headlines in 2016 after it produced an experimental batch of chocolate ice cream, known as “Obamka” or Little Obama. The company used the image of a boy with dark skin on its cover. 
The company was also in troubled waters after it chose to name of its ice cream as “Khokhol,” an ethnic slur used in Russia for Ukrainians. The product also used the colors of Ukraine’s national flag on its wrapper.

Meghan Markle is getting ready to tie the knot with Prince Harry.  According to Daily Mail, Meghan Markle attended a private ceremony held at St. James’s Place, in London. Present at the ceremony was Prince Harry, her fiancé, and Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
Justin Welby conducted the baptizing service, which lasted for 45 minutes, allowing Meghan to join the ranks of the Church of England.  The service took place in the evening, at Chapel Royal, St. James’s Palace. The Archbishop used River Jordan as the source for the holy water to baptize the American actor.
Although the Kensington Palace hasn’t made an official statement, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, the Duchess of Cornwall were present at the private ceremony, as the crown’s representatives. They organized a small dinner to honor Meghan for her decision to get baptized. However, Queen Elizabeth II wasn’t at the ceremony. Also, Kensington Palace hasn’t made an official statement about the attendees for the event.
Meghan formed a strong bond with Welby after the Archbishop guided her about the sacraments and rites of the Church of England.
Even though it wasn’t necessary for the American actor to undertake baptism, she went through with it anyway. Her decision to be a part of the Anglican faith shows how much she respects the Church of England’s head, Queen Elizabeth II.   
Two days after her baptizing ceremony, she stepped out with Prince Harry, making a public appearance in Birmingham. The duo was greeted by a large number of fans while wearing navy coats. The happy pair has been making various public appearances, after the announcement of their engagement. They also spent Christmas with the royal family, with the likes of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, her husband. 

Both of them were in Birmingham for launching an important project to mark the auspicious International Women’s Day. The project aims to inspire young women to strive towards careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
Prince William, Catherine, Prince Harry, and Meghan attended an event on February 28, to talk about the Royal Foundation’s future.
At present, Meghan has a lot on her hands, due to the wedding preparations. She is expected to continue working hard on empowering women and girls residing in the UK after her marriage.

WRN: I noticed looking at your 10-year reflection on your site you’ve mentioned as technology is changing you’re still noticing some of the same issues with church marketing. What are some of those specific changes in technology you’re referring to and what are those issues you are still noticing?
Brad Abare: Good question. The technology I was referring to is in the broader scope of technology, in the last 10 or 15 years whether it’s mobile technology, the fact that we can have everything in our hand. Whether it’s social where everyone is connected to every other person on the planet. We feel closer. More access than ever before. 
That is what I meant, on the technology side of things. Its availability and accessibility. The downside of that is we have some of the great problems we have particularly seen in the last couple of decades. Communication, in regard to churches, meaning we continue to assume that technology is going to solve the problem of getting our message across or getting the point across or helping people understand X, Y, Z. It’s really just helped get the message more complicated and more nuanced and more frustrating because we have more ways to do it, but less is getting through. That is the disconnect and concern in that context. 
“It’s really just helped get the message more complicated and more nuanced and more frustrating because we have more ways to do it, but less is getting through.”
WRN: What population have you found to be the hardest in communication? Is it current members that might have lapsed? Bringing in new members? Which group is the hardest for churches to communicate to generally?
BA: It is all over the place. There are churches that do better than others in different populations: some do better with insiders, others do better with outsiders. Usually, they are not as good at the opposite. Communicating to the congregation, communicating to members, some of the issues there, the issue here is that they assume everyone gets it because they send it out on a Sunday or send it out on a church bulletin, or we send it out in an email newsletter, or our Facebook group. That is a problem. 
With communicating to outsiders we get discouraged by thinking that we have to outdo or overdo what other churches are doing, or more to the point of competition, its often leader time, shopping with the Christmas season, or Sunday sports. It is appealing to the hole of the heart, that everyone is searching for something more meaningful and churches are trying to break through the clutter and the noise beyond the discount coupons and referral for a friend stuff. 
“Churches are trying to break through the clutter and the noise beyond the discount coupons and referral for a friend stuff.”
WRN: You emphasize different marketing channels like Social Media or Email. How do you help someone who is not tech savvy to improve communication for their church? What advice do you give them using those strategies or do you recommend a completely different path?
BA: When they say they are not tech savvy I actually love that. I think it adds a lot less complexity to the situation. And it depends on who they are trying to reach. If they are trying to reach 25-35-year-olds they are probably not able to reach them without some element of digital communication in their strategy. Chances are pretty good if they are not tech savvy they have other people in their church who are not tech savvy who they should probably buckle down and try to reach. The churches that are digitally savvy often miss the people who aren’t. This is what goes back to the uniqueness and beauty of churches – there are so many options, so many variations, so many colors and stripes and lots of different ways to do it.  So just because someone is not tech savvy, that is not a deal killer, but it does mean they are going to have to work a little harder to walk the block and be engaged in the community. Definitely not just from a desktop computer or laptop.
WRN: What if they say they are tech savvy but not complicated? Or is it unique to each situation?
BA: Depends. Are they focusing on church growth? Growing the number of their parishioners? Trying to grow the engagement of the current congregation? Are they trying to reach out to the neighborhoods around them that are not members, but are of different socioeconomic status and need help with food or clothes or rent? Who are they trying to reach and what are they trying to do with that? Just like any marketing communication, whether traditional or for churches there is no “one size fits all.” 
WRN: What have you found to be the most popular need of those who seek out your help?
BA: Because of the nature of our organization and whose behind it we are definitely contacted by those that are not complicated but are not afraid. They don’t have the sophistication or digital communication or marketing communication done online or social media, etc but they are not afraid. They are trying to figure out what should I do? What could I do? What could be done? 
The ones who are sophisticated don’t need us. They are the ones that are writing books on it. They are the ones that are probably volunteering with us or are on the board. They are trying to give back. That would be more the people that are helping and serving.
WRN: What is the common feedback that you see from working with people?
BA: It is certainly encouraging. It helps keeps us going. We are all volunteers. None of us take paychecks or salaries from this and so we continue to volunteer and be a part of it because of the churches that we help. From everything from the small churches that feel we have given them a lift from the resources and materials or books or training to the moderately sized church whether its 400-500 members, but they don’t have the have the sophistication or ability to hire out. It is certainly encouraging and very grateful.
“None of us take paychecks or salaries from this and so we continue to volunteer and be a part of it because of the churches that we help.” 
WRN: Has there been a time, based on feedback, that you have implemented and changed what you have done?
BA: The training events. For a long time, we had resisted training events. We were certainly not against training. We just felt that we were not the ones to go into that kind of product offering to speak because there are a lot of good ones and great people offering those advantages. So we just offered support. We continue to have people coming to us asking for training events because we are not a personality-driven thing. We are not a big mega church thing, a small church thing, or a denomination thing. 
We come from a neutral playing field and really provide some robust training. We have done that for the last four years, selectively. The price point is a little higher because we want to make sure the people attending really want this and we try to keep the groups small, about 20-25 people. 
WRN: Has anyone expressed concern that this might dilute the message of religious doctrine by using marketing techniques? That the message and the story should speak for itself. As you say on the site, the Bible has the greatest stories ever told. 
BA: Absolutely. That even continues today, but less and less when we started in 2004. There has been a progressive slide in that regard. That said, it is still certainly a palpable concern and I have it too, as one of the founders because the second it starts to feel slimy or slick or packaged or too complicated then I’m wondering “am I missing the message?”  The story of the Gospel in the Bible is not overly complicated. It did take the technology of its day and there are certain principles of going where the people are. Let’s love people generously. These are messages that are still relevant today. I just think there is a lot of competing for the attention and affections of people and churches need to know how to inspect and redirect it.
“There is a lot of competing for the attention and affections of people and churches need to know how to inspect and redirect it..
WRN: Are there any techniques in traditional marketing you find less effective or more underhanded that should be avoided?
BA: I would probably steer clear of direct response line of marketing in the sense of how to get as many people to look, click, or come. That type of an approach is certainly not what I would apply in the church context. I understand in the marketplace there is a place for it, that infomercial, middle of the night kind of appeal. “Call now, supplies are limited.” That is the kind of marketing and kind of approach. Too many churches try that approach. And it works because it taps into the emotions that are heavy in all of us of fear, of isolation. All the stuff that anyone can play on. And then when your service and product can solve that pain for me I will want you. And some churches are guilty of that too.
WRN: So you mean clickbait?
BA: Or it could be “God has amazing plans for your life. Order my book to learn how.” Or “we know the secrets, so come to our marriage classes this weekend.” It is one thing to make it available, it is another thing to market it and be a little bit gimmicky.
WRN: Are there particular techniques you find especially effective?
BA: The churches that get their congregation actually doing what the church says that they do are the churches that I see as most effective. The churches that say “we love our community, we are a place in the community, and we engage our community.” You can tell pretty quickly if they believe that a lot. If you find people that are actively involved in surrounding community, in the schools, in government, in all of society that keep a community running. That is where I see the most effective communication and attracting more and more of the people that can perpetuate that. 
“The churches that get their congregation actually doing what the church says that they do are the churches that I see as most effective.” 
WRN: So engagement is the metric that should be used?
BA: Absolutely. I would argue that is probably on the top five things. The latest study is that is what pastors want. That local engagement. If that could be the metric rather then the butts in pews or how much money is donated. I understand why we continue to do that. If we only measure butts or dollars we are missing that. Engagement is what we should be measuring of the help of the congregation. 
WRN: Where should people start on your homepage?
BA: If you go to ChurchMarketingSucks.com and if you look at the very top that says “read this first,” that is the starting point. It has the popular and preferred information.
WRN: Is there any other advice or information you want to share with people who want to improve their communication or an audit they should be giving to themselves to see if they need external support?
BA: The one question that I would lead with, with a nod to Peter Drucker, is what is your church doing and how is that going for you? It is a very simple question, but its very hard for people to answer. “Well we do everything: we do outreach, we do services, we do fund-raising.” Well, what are you really doing? What are you really trying to see happen? And how is that going? And if they can really answer that if the communication can come around, if the messaging can come around, if the pastor/sermons can come around to continue that support what it is what they are trying to do then I think that is a great way.

There is a controversy about the marriage of Prince Harry of Great Britain to American actress Meghan Markle. This is not Meghan Markle’s first marriage. This could be an issue for the Church of England, where remarriage is not allowed unless in “exceptional circumstances.” 
This does not seem like a problem for the upcoming royal nuptials. In addition, Meghan Markle will need to be baptized into the Church of England because she was raised Protestant.

Even though the couple has kept their relationship private, Meghan Markle’s biracial background, her first marriage, and being American, has caused tabloid journalists to be brutal in their depiction of her, causing Prince Harry to make a rare public appeal for decency and respect for her privacy. 
This will be the first marriage of a member of the royal family to a divorcee in 81 years. The previous was the famous marriage of the Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee to King Edward III, causing him to abdicate the throne. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has already approved the marriage and said it is consistent with church doctrine.

If the first weekend of the NCAA tournament felt like an eternity to you, you’re not alone. While a shocking number of upsets led to the elimination of many top NBA prospects, there’s still plenty of action left to watch and intriguing players on scouts’ radars. Though teams aren’t judging guys off of one or two great games, March can be extremely valuable when it comes to perception, and being seen by the right team at the right time can make a big difference.
Without any intense overreactions after the first weekend of March Madness, here are three players who helped themselves and three who didn’t.
Height: 6'6"" | Weight: 180 | Age: 19
There’s arguably no prospect who’s had a more individually impressive last two weeks than Gilgeous-Alexander, who led Kentucky to an SEC tournament title and wins over Davidson and Buffalo to make the Sweet 16. Back in November, he looked tentative and unprepared to run a team. Now John Calipari can’t afford to take him off the floor. His arc has been a total sea change: over his last 10 games dating back to Feb. 17, he’s averaging 18.1 points, 5.2 rebounds, 6.6 assists, 1.7 steals and just 2.3 turnovers, while shooting 51.2% from the field and making 11–21 attempts from three-point range. His stellar play predates the tournament, and to be fair, slicing up lesser opponents out in Boise this week should have been expected. There’s a sneaky case for the 19-year-old as the most intriguing point guard prospect in the draft, and at the very least a lottery-caliber talent.
Where Trae Young and Collin Sexton thrive off scoring the ball, and within systems that play heavily through them, Gilgeous-Alexander’s patient game sits on the opposite end of the spectrum. At 6’6”, he plays a unique, unselfish brand of offense centered on his innate ability to change speeds and directions with the ball in his hands. He’s become more aggressive going to the rim, where his long strides and ability to find gaps in the defense help split the difference with his lack of explosiveness. Though his jump shot is still in question, it doesn’t hurt that he’s been making them, and quality free throw numbers help support his case to sustain a productive clip from three long-term. A Final Four run could be in the cards for Kentucky, which faces Kansas State on Thursday and as the No. 5 seed is the highest-ranked team left in the South Regional. Each win is another opportunity for Gilgeous-Alexander to keep it rolling.
Height: 6'5"" | Weight: 195 | Age: 18
Smith was an unknown recruit when he arrived at Texas Tech as a freshman last year. Now, he’s firmly on the NBA radar, turning heads over the course of the season with his athletic feats and disruptive defense. He’s an essential piece for the Red Raiders, and after posting 18 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in a win over Florida, Smith is forcing the issue a little bit when it comes to his draft case. Right now he’d probably be an early second-round selection. Stranger things have gone down thanks to the glare of March.
Though he’s certain to be a project if he comes out and needs time to develop his offensive skills and defensive technique, there’s something to be said for players turning pro when their athletic upside effectively eclipses the worth of the sample size (read: how long) teams have to figure them out. Smith’s main tools are his explosiveness and instincts for blocking shots and creating turnovers. He struggles to create his own looks off the dribble and is almost entirely reliant on teammates. He turns 19 later this year and has barely played high-level basketball. But think about Hamidou Diallo, who stayed at Kentucky last season instead of leaving for a likely late first-round selection, returned to school and got exposed. For Smith’s actual development, it’s probably good for him to stay in school, but for his draft stock, it could break either way. The Sweet 16 is another chase for him to showcase his upside.
Height: 6'5"" | Weight: 205 | Age: 20
After Norvell redshirted last year, it became apparent early this season that the 6’5” freshman sharpshooter is far and away the most talented member of Gonzaga’s backcourt. And while he should be considered a name for the 2019 draft and beyond, his late-game heroics against UNC-Greensboro and a ridiculous 28-point, 12-rebound line while playing 39 minutes against Ohio State haven’t gone unnoticed. The Chicago native has come a long way in a short period of time, and brings essential dimensions of floor-spacing, athleticism and toughness for the Bulldogs.
Gonzaga runs an egalitarian style of offense, but shots have gravitated toward Norvell, who has a sweet lefthanded stroke, can attack closeouts off the dribble and is especially dangerous off the catch when the play swings back to him on the weak side. He’s got a projectable body and can function with or without the ball in his hands. Don’t heap massive expectations on him too soon, but keep an eye on him as the spotlight increases. Between Norvell, Rui Hachimura and Killian Tillie, the Zags have a solid trio.
Height: 6'2"" | Weight: 180 | Age: 19
Young actually played fine in Oklahoma’s first-round loss to Rhode Island, but as Jake Fischer detailed last week, the NBA’s perception of his potential is a departure from what the court of public opinion has suggested all season. He had an unspectacular February, which was predictable as Big 12 teams got second looks at him and gameplanned to take him out of his comfort zone. But the NBA is asking other questions, too. How much of his late-season swoon was due to the physical rigors of the season? Can his slight build handle that? There were also times he appeared to check out mentally. The mid-to-late lottery feels about right for Young, who’s now in competition with Sexton and Gilgeous-Alexander to be the first point guard drafted. Don’t obsess over the lows, but consider what it might take to replicate his peak production, and the situation is a bit more complicated.
Height: 6'10"" | Weight: 215 | Age: 19
To be clear, we’re not piling on Porter Jr. for wanting to come back and close out the season. It’s nice that he cares, and the move may not impact his draft slot much at all. But most expected him to return sluggish and out of shape, and that’s exactly what happened. He managed 16 points against Florida State in an early tournament exit, but didn’t look mobile at all and shot just 4-12 from the floor, though he did grab 10 rebounds. It’s less about the numbers than the fact that some of his weaknesses were laid bare. He has a bit of a loose handle, isn’t exceptionally explosive and doesn’t play a ton of defense—and all those things were true pre-injury. The cat is out of the bag in terms of where he’s at, and it’s fair to expect his individual workouts to be carefully curated after we know the lottery order. All 30 teams have now seen what the situation is, and some are skeptical as to why he’d even risk his health. Maybe none of this matters. But the overall level of doubt doesn’t feel promising.
Height: 6'5"" | Weight: 205 | Age: 21
NBA scouts are by and large way down on Trier, who despite his impressive efficiency and shooting splits managed to hurt himself this season by failing to re-orient his selfish style of play. Trier shot 62% on twos, 38% on threes and 86% from the stripe, and while he tallied up assists, they often came as a byproduct of game flow rather than any degree-of-difficulty creation for others. His bad habits were on full display in Arizona’s shocking loss to Buffalo, as he opted to chuck threes and stop the ball on many occasions and failed to make a positive impact. If he wants to play like that in the NBA, his window of opportunity will shut quickly. One bad game can’t break a player, but it can certainly reinforce opinion over their shortcomings.

Monday, March 12, 11 a.m. CT, start of the NFL’s legal tampering period, in the downtown Chicago office of agent Mike McCartney:
Indianapolis calls. Colts want free-agent center Ryan Jensen.
            Tennessee calls. Jensen.
            Kansas City calls. Jensen.
            About 11:10, the first Kirk Cousins call. It’s Arizona GM Steve Keim.
            Denver calls. Cousins.
            Miami calls. Jensen.
            The Jets call. Cousins.
            Tampa Bay calls. Jensen.
            Minnesota calls. Cousins.
            It’s after 2 now, and McCartney has missed about 50 calls and texts.
On and on it went, for Cousins and Jensen and other free agents or trade targets in McCartney’s Priority Sports group—defensive tackle Haloti Ngata, quarterback Josh McCown, quarterback Trevor Siemian. Another client, Jags linebacker Paul Posluszny, was verging on retirement. After 48 hours of phones and texts and four-hour-sleep nights, McCartney went to the chiropractor Wednesday.
“You’re a wreck!” the chiropractor said, seeing and feeling McCartney all knotted up.
“You have no idea what I’ve been through the last two days,” McCartney said.
Anything in the NFL is old news if it happened 90 minutes ago, so covering something four days ago is so … ’90s. But indulge me. The Kirk Cousins story is still fresh to me, with lots of unanswered questions (Did the Jets get played? Was the fix in a month ago? Did the Broncos really not make an offer?) about the richest per-year contract in NFL history.
I’ve found the agent for Cousins, Mike McCartney, to be an honorable man in my dealings with him over the years. All of us in this business have to judge the people we come in contact with and make decisions on how much we trust them. Whenever McCartney has told me something, it’s been the truth. He mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that he’d been keeping a journal on the Cousins negotiations, going back to the Washington days; he continued last week, when things got intense. So I asked him if he would run me through the Cousins sweepstakes, starting at 11 a.m. CT last Monday, when the NFL allowed agents and teams to begin negotiating. In an hour and 50 minutes on Saturday, he gave me his version of the events that led to Cousins’ three-year, $84-million fully guaranteed contract. A couple of things he would not discuss: He would not disclose any offers except the one that won—Minnesota. And though McCartney characterized the tenor of his talks with each team, he would not divulge privileged conversations with negotiators for any team.
At the beginning of the process, McCartney said, he and his staff produced a book for Cousins that detailed the seven teams he felt might be interested in Cousins once it was clear Washington was not going to make him a serious long-term contract offer: Arizona, Buffalo, Cleveland, Denver, Miami, Minnesota and the Jets. This winter he and Cousins had discussed in detailed phone calls each team—how close it was to competing for a title, who would coach him, the style of offense, the lifestyle of the area. And on Monday at 11, he wasn’t positive how many teams would call, but he had a good feeling that at least four would. He told each one to make its best offer. This was not going to last long. At the beginning of the process Monday, McCartney felt strongly that any of the four—Cards, Broncos, Jets, Vikings—could win. But he and Cousins, before any formal bids came, felt that probably Minnesota and the Jets had an edge. (More about that later.)
This process, McCartney decided, was going to be a silent auction. One offer per team. That would be it. Then a visit or two to a team (Cousins said he wanted to meet the coaches he’d be working with before signing anything); then a decision. “Kirk was not going to sign before he met the coaches and got a feel for the culture,” McCartney said.
It was a curious decision by McCartney. Cousins had waited more than two years for this chance to be on the open market. Now it was going to be a sprint? “I never used the words ‘silent auction,’” McCartney said Saturday, “but that’s what this was. I made it clear to each team that if they held back, it was going to hurt them.”
Two reasons McCartney wanted to do it this way: Because several teams had quarterback needs, he knew if one or two teams sensed they were out, Cousins’ market could deflate quickly. Teams are pragmatic; the fans want their GMs to shoot for the moon, but in this game of quarterback musical chairs, if one team had only one other quarterback it really wanted—Denver and Case Keenum, for instance (which was the truth)—and learned it wasn’t the front-runner, there’s a good chance it would exit quickly.
And a fully guaranteed deal was going to be a high priority. Surprisingly, this wasn’t a big problem with the teams wanting Cousins. “There will be no discounts,” McCartney said.
The pitches were strong, without many upsets. Arizona pushed its strong core of young premier players (David Johnson, Chandler Jones, Patrick Peterson). The Jets pushed their $100 million in cap room, the fact that offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates would continue the kind of system and game-planning that Cousins knew from Washington, and that he’d be a franchise quarterback in the biggest market in the league. The Vikings felt they had everything in place to win multiple titles except a premier quarterback—plus a new facility and a new stadium.
Denver? The Broncos didn’t make an offer. This went to McCartney’s reason for making this a silent auction: Denver liked Keenum, didn’t want to pay in the neighborhood of $30 million a year guaranteed for a quarterback with so many other prominent players to pay. It came down to this for John Elway: Keenum for $10 million to $12 million per year less than Cousins, and the Broncos knew near the start of the legal tampering period they could get Keenum. Ten hours into the period, Denver had reached agreement with Keenum on a two-year, $36 million guaranteed deal.
McCartney understood Elway’s approach—Elway didn’t want to be left at the altar. McCartney did think, What harm would it do to make an offer? But Elway liked Keenum a lot, and felt he couldn’t wait until Thursday or Friday to see if he’d get Cousins.
Meanwhile, McCartney found time to discuss the three offers with Cousins that afternoon. There were no others. They prioritized Minnesota, because the Vikings were amenable to making Cousins the highest-paid quarterback in the game, fully guaranteed, at about three years and $84 million, and they were the closest to winning now. But Cousins was firm that he wouldn’t sign until he met the coaches and staff—he did not know offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, and didn’t know quarterbacks coach Kevin Stefanski well. The Jets were two (thanks to Jeremy Bates, and, presumably, a higher offer), Arizona three. McCartney and Cousins had several conversations about all of the teams. But one point McCartney wanted Cousins to realize about the two teams was this: The Vikings were closer to winning right now, with a talented young base and the kind of team that could win when Cousins didn’t play his best. The Jets didn’t have as good a supporting cast, and so Cousins might have to be more of a team-carrier there. And in New York, there wouldn’t be the kind of patience there’d be in Minnesota if Cousins struggled.
McCartney did say last week that Cousins didn’t take the biggest deal, so that implies that the Jets offered more money than the Vikings. In fact, the Broncos felt sure that the Jets would be the highest bidders of the four teams.
At about 8 or 9 p.m., McCartney called the Vikings to tell them they’d be Cousins’ first visit on Wednesday night and Thursday, with no promises. By later that night, taking advantage of the two-hour time difference between Chicago and Arizona, McCartney told Keim that he couldn’t guarantee him a Cousins visit, and if he had to move on, he’d understand. On Tuesday at 9:15 a.m., McCartney called the Jets. The Jets wanted to be assured they’d get to make their case to Cousins one-on-one.
“That was a tough phone call,” McCartney said. “They were clearly frustrated. They wanted to be guaranteed a visit. I told them I couldn’t guarantee a visit, that if he goes to Minnesota and loves it, he could sign. They were not happy about that. I understand, but I told everyone all along what the rules were, and we abided by them.”
That set up a strange-bedfellows kind of conversation. The Jets’ veteran quarterback fallback was Josh McCown, a McCartney client. The Jets had to position themselves to make sure that when the music stopped and the musical chairs got filled, they’d still be able to get McCown—at least. By later that morning, Tuesday, they were talking McCown with McCartney. But Buffalo also was seriously interested in McCown, so the Jets put their best contractual foot forward there and ensured they’d keep the trusted veteran who played so well last year, at 38. McCown to the Jets, one year, $5 million signing bonus, $5 million salary. At 39, he’d make the most money of his well-traveled NFL career.
McCartney knew now that the visit by Cousins was vital—because they might not have great options if for some reason Cousins hated something about the Vikings. Minnesota sent its plane to Atlanta, where Cousins was spending time with his in-laws, Wednesday at the start of the free agency period—4 p.m. ET. Accompanied by Vikings GM Rick Spielman, Cousins and his wife, Julie, and son, Cooper, flew to Minneapolis to join a contingent of 13 for dinner Wednesday night, including owner Mark Wilf, coach Mike Zimmer, Spielman, DeFilippo and wife, Stefanski and wife, tight end Kyle Rudolph and wife, and wideout Adam Thielen and wife. Independently, Cousins’ mom and dad came in to help babysit Cooper and experience the moment, and that night McCartney got a call from Don Cousins. The Vikings had left two Cousins jerseys—Vikings purple, number 8, with COUSINS on the back—in the parents’ hotel room, one for dad and one for mom. “That’s the first time I ever got a jersey from a team,” Don Cousins told McCartney.
While Cousins was flying to Minnesota, two important things happened. McCartney worked out the final wrinkles in the contract; there would be no-trade and no-transition-tag clauses in the three-year deal, fully guaranteed. But McCartney couldn’t accept it without Cousins’ nod. Also while the plane was in the air: Spielman told Cousins the Vikings were finalizing a trade for Trevor Siemian of the Broncos. During the negotiations, McCartney had stressed to the Vikings how important a helpful backup quarterback would be to Cousins. What a coincidence—McCartney represents Siemian. Late Wednesday, Siemian was officially a Viking.
At 8:15 p.m., between the appetizer and the entrée, Cousins saw a text from McCartney, still in Chicago. The agent wanted to know how dinner was going.
No reply.
An hour passed. Two hours.
At 10:37 p.m., Cousins texted back: “It’s going very well. Had a great dinner. Grateful for the opportunity.”
No red flags, McCartney knew; Cousins would have told him if there were. McCartney got on a plane Thursday morning for Minneapolis, and met Cousins at the Vikings’ facility. At 2:30 p.m., the long, strange trip of Kirk Cousins’ rise to being the highest paid player in NFL history was complete. He signed his contract.
“How awesome is this?” McCartney said to Cousins.
“This is great,” Cousins said, beaming. “I am so thrilled.”
“It took a lot to get here, bro,” McCartney said.
It took two-and-a-half years, and contentious negotiations with Washington, and the football world telling McCartney and Cousins, the former fourth-round pick, that they were nuts for not taking Dan Snyder’s millions. Again and again. Understandable. Now Cousins was the richest player in NFL history, and McCartney could finally unclench. His chiropractor would approve.
“Was it worth it?” I asked.
“Hard to answer,” McCartney said on Saturday, taking a break from NCAA tournament viewing. “I do know he’s the face of a franchise in a great situation, on a team that has a chance to win the Super Bowl. I always told him, ‘I want you to be in a place where you look forward to going to work every day, you love the quarterback room, you love the culture, and your family loves where you live.’ I think we found that.”
Now it’s simple. Now all Kirk Cousins has to do is be great.
Before we analyze the winner and loser in the big weekend Jets-Colts deal (there is neither, by the way), I’ll make one prediction: There’s a good chance the Colts aren’t done trading yet. After dealing from three to six, I could see them moving down one more time before the April 26 first round. GM Chris Ballard said as much to his team’s website Saturday, and I can add a confirmation to that. Ballard’s going to try.
This deal: Indianapolis traded the third overall pick to the Jets for a first-rounder this year (sixth overall), two second-rounders this year (37th and 49th overall) and a second-round pick next year.
It’s pretty easy to say the Colts routed the Jets, getting three second-round picks to move three measly spots. But they’re three giant spots if you want to be assured of getting one of the top quarterbacks in this draft.
The earliest we’ll be able to make an educated guess on the outcome of the deal is in mid- to late-2019, when we’ve seen the quarterback the Jets pick play pro football, and we know if making that deal was worth Indy’s haul of four picks in the top 50, or whatever Colts GM Chris Ballard turns them into.
Two recent deals must be studied for precedent here:
• In 2012, Washington traded three first-round picks and a second-round pick to the Rams for the second overall pick. Immense payment to move up four spots. In fact, on the Draft Trade Value Chart that some teams use (not religiously), Washington gave up 5,490 points of draft-pick value and acquired 2,600. But that was the price they had to pay to move up for Robert Griffin III. Griffin, of course, was a bust. So you’d think the Rams killed Washington on the trade. But with the trade of linebacker Alec Ogletree to the Giants this month, the Rams have only defensive tackle Michael Brockers left from the mega-trade with Washington. They made terrible use of the picks. If possible, considering so many dashed hopes, this was a trade that hurt both teams.
• In 2016, Philadelphia traded first-, third- and fourth-round picks in 2016, a first-round pick in 2017 and a second-round pick in 2018 to Cleveland to acquire the second overall pick in the ’16 draft, and a fourth-rounder in 2017. That first-rounder turned into Carson Wentz, who appears to be a franchise quarterback. Cleveland? It’s not over, but it’s not looking good so far. The five picks from Philadelphia have so far turned into 10 picks, and of the eight players the Browns have chosen so far, only one of them—safety Jabrill Peppers—appears to have a chance to be a top-flight starter. The highest pick, wideout Corey Coleman (15th overall, 2016) has been wholly unimpressive. Cleveland has the fourth and 64th picks this year to try to make this trade pay off.
That’s why it’s folly to say the Jets overpaid. What New York has done, in the wake of losing Kirk Cousins to the Vikings in last week’s free-agency derby, is settle for its second-best quarterback option. The Jets have assured themselves of one of the top four passers in the draft—either Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen or Josh Allen. My money’s on Mayfield, who could go from the pride of Norman to Broadway Baker.
The pressure on GM Mike Maccagnan? Immense. This could be it for him, his last chance in his fourth season to construct a winner. He blew his first shot at a quarterback of the future, taking Christian Hackenberg in the second round in 2016. Hackenberg has not played a single snap in either of the last two 5-11 Jets’ seasons, which is some indictment of him as a football player and of the management that drafted him. The Jets have been uber-focused on trading or drafting a quarterback since the start of the college football season last fall, and now that they’ve traded four usable pieces to move up to get one, Maccagnan simply has to get it right. This will be the Jets’ most important draft pick in years.
Ballard got a lot of “attaboy” calls/texts over the weekend, and rightly so. I had one GM tell me his team has about 70 players on its draft board rated as starter-quality, which strikes me as about right judging how teams have told me they’re judging this draft.
STARTING PLAYERS IN THE 2018 NFL DRAFT INTERLUDE. Interesting question. Queried about how many starting-caliber players they felt were in this draft, six scouting people or GMs over the weekend came back with these figures: 35, “40 to 50,” “about 70,” 73, “75-ish,” 83 and 111. I asked because I wanted to figure out whether it made sense for the Colts to try to trade down one more time.
ASTERISK TO STARTING PLAYER INTERLUDE. One of those teams said if you considered “situational starters” like third corners or slot corners, slot receivers or slotback/receiver types like Christian McCaffrey, he’d add 32 players to his team’s total. 
The Colts very much need to maximize this draft. It’s likely their roster is the weakest in the rising AFC South. Ballard knows he needs quantity in this draft. That’s why if he could turn the sixth pick into something in the 10 to 12 range and add another second-rounder, I believe he’d do it. At six, he’d likely have a chance at pass-rusher Bradley Chubb or guard Quenton Nelson. At 11, let’s say, he’d have a chance at a desperately needed rangy linebacker like Roquan Smith or Tremaine Edmunds. A second trade would mean Ballard would have turned the third overall pick into five players who would have a chance to start from this one trade alone.
Colts’ picks in the top four rounds now: 6, 36, 37, 49, 67, 104. If I were Ballard, I might trade down from 6 to Buffalo at 12 if the Bills would deal the 53rd overall pick and maybe the 96th pick as well—seeing that the price for a quarterback is more of a premium. But of course, this is probably a night-of-the-draft deal, because the Bills would have to see a quarterback they’d want here.
It’s such an inexact science, and the Rams’ and Browns’ hauls from their big deals show it’s great to get the picks, but you’ve got to be smart enough to use them well. As much as Andrew Luck’s return is the story of 2018 for the Colts, a very close second is what Ballard does with his five starter-caliber picks in the top 70 (as of this morning) in April.
Free agency is a tortuous process, because even when you think you’ve made a great deal, you’ve got this feeling deep down: What if the money spoils this guy? Or what if we’re overrating him after a small sample size?
So take this with caution, Bills Mafia. But your general manager, Brandon Beane, had a good week, from my view of it. To recap: He got the first pick in the third round for a quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, he was clearly ready to move on from; Beane also paid interesting young quarterback A.J. McCarron for two years what the Jets paid Josh McCown for one ($10 million); and Beane gambled that coach Sean McDermott can make talented but meh defensive tackle Star Lotulelei (five years, $50 million) shine again. At the same time, Beane was trying to keep his promise to owners Kim and Terry Pegula: fix the bloated salary cap he’d taken over 10 months ago. He’d do it, he vowed, after two seasons, and so part of his decisions this year included pinching pennies so he could clean up the cap by the opening of the 2019 league year.
I spoke with Beane on Friday afternoon about the big decisions he and coach Sean McDermott had made.
MMQB: You got Cleveland to take all of Tyrod Taylor’s salary, and got the first pick in the third round. How?
Beane: “We wanted to find a spot for him, not to just put him somewhere. We were open and honest with him and his agent. Sometimes these situations can get salty, but here, everybody wanted to do the right thing and not be confrontational. Getting the 65th pick was huge. Patience was the key. I am very happy how it worked out for the Bills and for Tyrod, and the financial part was a part of it. When it’s all said and done, we’re going to have about $45 million in dead money this year. That was part of my plan—to eat all of it, or as much as we could, this year.”
MMQB: You waited out the quarterback market, from the looks of it, and got McCarron for good value—two years, $10 million.
Beane: “We did due diligence there. Every dollar we spend there is a dollar less we can spend somewhere else. We didn’t want to get into chase mode. We had different guys we thought would fit, A.J. being one of them. One word we heard over and over from people who had coached him or known him. like Hue Jackson: competitor. That was music to my ears. He’ll fit here.”
MMQB: Star Lotulelei for medium defensive tackle price—was he a target from the beginning?
Beane: “I was part of the crew that drafted him in Carolina. One word for him: selfless. Luke Kuechly will rave about Star, because he allowed Luke to run free. For us, I believe Star can be a two-and-a-half-down player, playing some third downs.”
MMQB: Looks like you have the ammo to move up in the draft again and get one of the quarterbacks. Will you trade again?
Beane: “The truth? Most of these quarterbacks I’ve only spent 15 minutes with. [At the combine, each team can meet with prospects for a maximum of 15 minutes per player.] I haven’t spent enough time to have an opinion about any of them yet, honestly. I actually sent a little note to our [scouts] yesterday. We got six weeks to get our board together. I am not there yet, knowing if we can or will move up again. I want Sean to get to know all of them. We’re just keeping an open mind. Where we’re at, we’ve got the picks, we've got the draft capital. I’m not ready to pull the trigger.”
Cleveland left tackle Joe Thomas, one of the great players of his day at any position, will formally announce his retirement today after playing every Browns snap for 10-and-a-half seasons—from the time he was drafted in 2007 to the afternoon in October when he snapped a tendon in his arm and was lost for the remainder of the year.
But it’s not his torn triceps driving him away from football, or the prospect of a cushy TV job for FOX or ESPN, though both are knocking at his door, and he’s a candidate for a three-man booth at one of the two networks this fall. It’s his left knee. Four knee surgeries have left him with a bone-on-bone situation in the knee. It got so painful in the past couple of years that at times it was intolerable to even stand at practice—so he spent practices inside the trainers’ room. The knee was so bad that Thomas considered an experimental procedure that would have inserted baby cartilage in the knee. The knee was so bad that the only way he was able to play the first seven games last year was pre-season Platelet-Rich Plasma injections that made the pain in his knee tolerable.
The fact that Thomas was a Brown for his entire career, even though he had one legitimate chance to join a Super Bowl contender (Denver), is impressive enough. The fact that he played through the immense knee pain and never missed a snap until he tore his triceps last year should be enough to earn him a statue in Cleveland.
When Thomas speaks today, I don’t expect him to concentrate on the negative—the knee pain that required him to take so many pain-killers over the last few years, or the fact that in his last 10 seasons, the Browns never had a winning record. (In fact, if Thomas makes the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he’d make it having played on teams with a .287 winning percentage. It’s believed that would be the worst of any player or coach to gain Hall entry.) I think, knowing Thomas some, he’s more likely to crack a few jokes and try to make those in the room feel they’re not at a sad event. Rather, they’ll be at a celebration of one of the greatest Browns in modern Cleveland history.

I don’t know what to say but that was a thorough butt-whipping.”

“If you go back and look at the schedule, generally we got one of the worst NFL games each week. You’re trying to make something sound interesting and exciting that isn’t. For me, part of it was just the way the booth was set up the last two years. It was really geared around Jon Gruden. That’s not unusual, TV really is an analyst-driven medium. Jon had a particular set of skills that he did really well, and foremost among them was analyzing the play, breaking down the play. Here’s why they ran that play, here’s why it worked, here’s what this guy did or didn’t do. It was really football heavy, X-and-O heavy, and I think most play-by-play guys, all play-by-play guys, would’ve felt like a bit of a bystander.”

“When I got suspended for the season in 2012 over the alleged bounties in our games, it was a big shock to all of us. There was pressure from people in the league and the league office—I’m not going to say who—to fire me. Mr. Benson was resolute. ‘We’re not doing that,’ he said. ‘He doesn’t deserve that.’”
—New Orleans coach Sean Payton, in his column on the late Tom Benson for The MMQB on Friday.
That’s a “wow” to me. But Payton said that, yes, more than one person of influence wanted Benson to fire him.
When I think of a career comp for Trevor Siemian, who was traded from Denver to Minnesota on Thursday, I think of Ryan Fitzpatrick. Siemian may not end up as experienced as Fitzpatrick, or with as long a career, but they remind me of each other—bright, humble, excellent students of football, good-enough arms, good teammates as backups.
So I did a little research on their similarities, and it turned out a bit … well, “eerie” is probably the best word to describe the comparison:
I
The Saints have a sleep room in their football facility in Metairie, La.
As Sean Payton explained in his column for the The MMQB after the death of owner Tom Benson on Thursday, Benson was a generous sort for all things football, and, well, let Payton tell the story:
“Lots of coaches in the NFL periodically will sleep one or two nights in the office. With Mr. Benson, the challenge was getting the sleeping bag rolled or the couch folded up prior to him walking down the hall in the morning. He hated our offices looking sloppy. So he ended up footing the bill in 2016 for a high-tech sleep room at our facility—climate-controlled, built-in chargers for phone, blackout shades on the window and door. No more excuses for a sloppy office. The coaches loved it.”

The Dolphins issued this news release last Thursday, on the second day of the league year:
MIAMI – The Miami Dolphins today announced they have acquired center Daniel Kilgore and a 2018 seventh-round pick (227th overall) from San Francisco in exchange for a 2018 seventh-round pick (223rd overall).
Do you find anything odd about it?
Kilgore, the Niners’ starting center last year, was traded to the Miami Dolphins for improvement of four slots in the middle of the seventh round of the draft. The last round.
That is as close to a negligible return as anything in NFL history.
Kilgore was acquired for 1.3 points of draft value on the NFL Draft Value Trade Chart, made famous by the Cowboys around the time Jimmy Johnson took over as coach/trader in 1989. The 223rd pick is worth 2.3 points; the 227th pick is worth 1.0.

From “The MMQB Podcast With Peter King,” available where you download podcasts.
This week’s conversations: “Tom vs. Time” producer, director and cinematographer Gotham Chopra, former Browns and Eagles executive Joe Banner, and Nicki Jhabvala, who covers the Broncos for the Denver Post.
• Chopra on whether he thinks the Patriots’ Big Three (Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, Robert Kraft) is on the verge of a split: “... I mean, it’s an 18-year marriage, and it’s been an incredibly successful run, but there’s a lot of intensity and a lot of pressure, and a lot of big personalities. And Tom is one of them. That hasn’t been easy, and I find it interesting that by the end of the season, that all kind of faded away, because when you get to the end of the season, no matter what is going on, everyone sort of gets on the same page and focuses. Again, they had another incredible run. And that’s what he says at the end—is like, this is a very different offseason for him. And I think, that’s not necessarily what happened during the season. It’s the fact that he’s got three growing kids, a wife who’s like, ‘You know, I’ve kind of been putting stuff on hold for a while, and I wanna go out and do my thing now too.’ And so Tom’s juggling a lot of things, and I think that’s basically what he says at the end: I gotta recalibrate. I have to find that conviction again. I think he will, but, you know, this idea that he’s going to play for four or five more seasons… I mean, this is just me, the guy who’s been around him for a while now. I just have a hard time envisioning that, to be candid. But we’ll see. I do think that these next few weeks and months are a critical time for him.”
• Chopra on whether he has doubts that Brady will play in 2018: “No. You know, I’ve seen Tom’s process, and I think there’s very little doubt that he will eventually, this season, find that thing that will get him back and really amped for next season. This past year was very unsatisfying in terms of how it ended, and so I don’t necessarily envision him leaving that as the last taste to hold onto.”
1. I think these are my 2018 (Very Early) Free Agency Awards:
Three Best Decisions
• Cornerback Patrick Robinson (four years, $20 million) to the Saints. Robinson resuscitated his career in Philadelphia last season, becoming one of the best slot corners in football and starting the Eagles on their way to the NFC title-game rout with a pick-six interception. I like the contract much more than Tennessee paying the flawed Malcolm Butler $12 million a year. Robinson started 12 games in the slot and seven games outside for the Eagles. Versatile piece for Dennis Allen in the rising New Orleans defense.
• Running back Jerick McKinnon (four years, $30 million) to the Niners. A little rich, but McKinnon’s just 25, he blocks, he’s very physical for a 5'9"" back, and he can catch; he had six, six, seven and 11-catch games last season. Kyle Shanahan already installed him as his starter.
• Defensive tackle Muhammad Wilkerson (one year, $5 million) to the Packers. He was a $10-million-a-year player two years ago, and he screwed it up, and now he’s got a season to save his career, on a one-year prove-it contract, with a chip the size of a boulder on his shoulder. I like his chances to reward Green Bay.
Three Worst Decisions
• Arizona giving quarterback Sam Bradford one year and $20 million … with $15 million guaranteed. This is the way I would have made this deal, if I were Arizona: $5 million in bonuses and base salary, $1 million bonus for every start. If Bradford’s healthy, he earns $21 million. If not, he doesn’t eat up valuable cap space. And if Bradford finds a better deal elsewhere, let him go. I really like Bradford as a player, when he plays. But that’s the rub. He’s 19-19 over the past five years, and has missed more starts (42) than he’s made (38). I like the player, but not the contract.
• The Patriots letting left tackle Nate Solder get away. All the rest of the free-agent defections from New England are forgivable. Not this one, not with a slow quarterback who will play the 2018 season at 41.
• Kansas City giving wideout Sammy Watkins three years and $48 million. He’s had one 1,000-yard season out of four in the NFL, and no 10-touchdown seasons, and he caught 39 balls last year in an extremely wideout-friendly offense with the Rams. My jaw hit the floor when I saw this money.
2. I think—gut feeling—that Buffalo will try hard to move up in the first round to the Giants’ spot at two. Now that the Jets pick third, the Bills know there’s a good chance the top three picks will be quarterbacks. How can Buffalo risk waiting until four and, presumably, dealing with Cleveland to move up? Dangerous.
3. I think this is a really fun offseason, one of the best of the 34 NFL offseasons I’ve seen in my years covering the league.
4. I think this is an interesting history lesson: Exactly 25 years ago this week, NFL free agency dawned—and I was on a plane with Reggie White covering it. 
5. I think the Giants will go quarterback at two, but as one NFL GM told me Saturday: Just imagine the Giants taking Saquon Barkley. They’d have Odell Beckham, Evan Engram and Saquon Barkley. Wow! Respectively, they’d be 25, 23 and 21 years old.
6. I think Deadspin’s Dom Cosentino did a good job putting the Richard Sherman contract into perspective the other day. There were many hatchet jobs done on the deal—among them a surprise critic in the highly respected Joe Thomas, who said Sherman got “absolutely crushed” by the 49ers—that most saw as Sherman, representing himself, getting ripped off by the Niners. It’s true that Sherman’s deal, with only $3 million fully guaranteed, is fair game for scrutiny. A few points to make:
• A couple of things Sherman told me eight days ago in his only interview before the Niners introduced him at a press conference seemed significant. He really wanted to negotiate his own deal, in part for the experience of it. And take this for what it’s worth, but he said he wanted to be fair to the Niners, coming back from Achilles surgery, and to be sure that he earns the money he makes as a 30-year-old cornerback.
• If Sherman is healthy for 16 weeks and on the Niners’ active roster and plays 90 percent of the snaps, he’ll earn $10 million in 2018.
• One of the criticisms was over playing time. San Francisco pays Sherman a $1 million bonus if he plays 90 percent of the snaps on defense this season. Ben Volin of the Boston Globe called that 90-percent figure “insanely high.” Why? In the eight games before Sherman snapped his Achilles in 2017, here were his per-game numbers, per Pro Football Focus: 82 snaps played out of 82 plays in game one, 49-49 in game two, 73-73 in game three, 58-60 in game four, 74-74 in game five, 59-59 in game six, 71-71 in game seven, 60-63 in game eight. That’s 526 snaps, out of 531 Seattle defensive plays. In the first half of his age-29 season, Sherman played 99.1 percent of the Seattle defensive plays. In the previous three seasons, he played 98.8 percent, 98.3 percent and 97.8 percent. How, exactly, is it “insanely high” to have an incentive threshold of 90 percent to earn an extra $1 million?
• Think of the word “incentive” and the word “bonus.” This $1 million clause protects the team in case Sherman isn’t healthy enough or good enough to play every week at something near his previous level. And isn’t that what an incentive clause should be? If Sherman does what he’s done in the past, he’ll make the money. If he doesn’t, he won’t. I do not understand what is wrong or unfair or insane with that.
7. I think the Bengals should wave good-bye to Vontaze Burfict, in the wake of the news that he’s appealing a four-game PED suspension. Burfict was more trouble than he was worth two years ago, and he has continued to give the Bengals problems. At some point you’ve got to say to your locker room: Enough crap with this guy.
8. I think the Justin Pugh signing in Arizona makes the core that GM Jerry Reese left for Dave Gettleman with the Giants even worse. Pugh’s defection means that only one of Reese’s 45 picks in the six drafts from 2008 to 2013 is still on the team. (If you guessed Jason Pierre-Paul, you win.) Amazing: The number is 0-for-22 in the last three of those drafts—2011, 2012, 2013. Gettleman’s got a very tough road replenishing a thin roster.
9. I think we absolutely should praise middle linebacker Paul Posluszny, who in 11 years was a great professional, leader and football player. He played 148 games, mostly as the nerve center of the Bills and Jags defenses. Classic player. He could have played in the ’50s, ’80s or today. Not a lot of players can say they sacked Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees and intercepted Tom Brady and Cam Newton. Posluszny can. Good luck to him in retirement.
10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:
a. Story of the Week: by Tim Graham of the Buffalo News, an extended interview with O.J. Simpson, and it’s a very good one. (But what would you expect from Tim Graham?)
b. Simpson on Colin Kaepernick: “I think Colin made a mistake. I really appreciate what he was trying to say. I thought he made a bad choice in attacking the flag. I am a firm believer in doing what you think is right, but I would always stand for the flag.”
c. Congrats to Graham for pursuing Simpson and finally getting him to meet for an interview—even though Simpson put questions about the 1994 double murder off-limits.
d. Cool inside story of the week: by Marc Tracy of the New York Times, on the grand tradition of the Duke basketball team managers.
e. Not to get all Dukie on you or anything, but here’s a good read on what keeps Mike Krzyzewski going, from the great John Feinstein. Lessons in here for everyone.
f. Best story of the week on an athlete we’ve never heard of but we definitely should have: by Lindsay Crouse of the New York Times, on American marathoner/doctor Chris Zablocki.
g. Nice lead by Crouse: “One of the fastest American marathon runners right now is a 29-year-old doctor in rural Connecticut who doesn’t have a coach, doesn’t have a sponsor and doesn’t run with a watch. He trains alone, as long as feels right, with ‘only the trees for teammates,’ he says. In the past seven years he has raced 47 marathons, winning 19 of them.”
h. No Pac-12 teams make it past round one of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. That stuns me. I’m not much of a college basketball fan, but wow.
i. Replay is bad enough in the NFL. It is a killer in the NCAA tournament. It took 11 minutes, 42 seconds to play 8.9 seconds in the Marshall upset of Wichita State.
j. I watched most of Buffalo-Kentucky on Saturday. I love seeing true underdogs plays with ferocity, which is exactly what Buffalo did in a loss. No fear. Tremendous effort in a loss.
k. Coffeenerdness: Never, ever take away the smoked butterscotch latte, Starbucks.
l. Beernerdness: Never, ever stop brewing beer, Four Peaks Brewing of Tempe.
m. This is why Yahoo’s Pete Thamel, formerly of Sports Illustrated, is so good.
n. After the UMBC win Friday night, Thamel got coaches from the low-mid-major America East Conference on the phone. He finished interviewing them after midnight. When I checked my phone at 5:13 a.m. Saturday (I’m a bad sleeper), there was Thamel’s story. Great enterprise reporting. Aimed to speak to five America East coaches after 11 p.m. ET. Went five-for-five. Now that’s some good reporting. Story was live by 2 a.m.
o. Colgate at USF, CBI postseason tournament. I mean, why? Why does a team travel 3,000 miles cross-country, so that 1,339 people could show up in the University of San Francisco’s campus gym to see a 72-68 basketball game on Wednesday night? I guess it’s a free country, but it seems insignificant bordering on wasteful.
p. Very best wishes, Gary Myers of the New York Daily News, on whatever is next for you. Gary’s been a valuable peer and friend over the years, and his Sunday notes column has been a staple for me.
q. You as well, Jim Trotter, a former colleague of mine at SI. Jim leaves ESPN with some great TV stories and experience under his belt, and he’ll be a great addition for someone.
r. Nice week for the president. He fired the Secretary of State of the United States of America—who is only the most single most important person aside from the president in dealing with world affairs—on Twitter before speaking to him. What a great guy, Donald Trump. Firing people, not to mention one of the most important people in the free world, on social media. Then the president fired the former deputy director of the FBI, career law-enforcement officer Andrew McCabe, days before he’d have qualified for his pension, apparently because the president felt McCabe was too close and too sympathetic to former FBI director James Comey. (Also: NBC reported in January that Trump, in a conversation with McCabe, called McCabe’s wife “a loser” when she lost an election for a Virginia state senate seat.) All week, news of the legal fight between porn star Stormy Daniels and Trump over their alleged 2006 affair filled TV shows and the internet and front pages nationwide.
s. Just another week in the life of our country, 2018. Are we planning to wake up anytime soon?
t. Former CIA director John Brennan spoke for all people on the right side of history Saturday, using the president’s favorite medium, Twitter, thusly as he addressed the president: “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”
u. Wish I were that eloquent.
Not sure it’s true, but
            many around league see Jets
            focused on Baker.

The legend of Konate took flight the way many things do in sport these days. 
Via gif.
Actually, in Konate’s case, it started with a series of gifs that came in a flurry on a Monday night in Morgantown when No. 10 Kansas visited No. 6 West Virginia. Sagaba Konate’s first rejection came on a fast break 38 seconds into the game. Less than 30 seconds later, Konate swatted another Jayhawks lay-up attempt away. Then, on a two-on-one fast break, Svi Mykhailiuk tried to posterize the sophomore center who was positioned under the basket and met Mykhailiuk at the rim with a two-handed block volleyball style stuff. Mitch Lightfoot tried Konate two minutes later and he, too, got denied. His fifth of the first half came when KU’s Marcus Garrett soared in from the right wing only to get shut down with another two-handed block.
Kansas players shouldn’t feel deflated. Konate, as the last line of defense to the vaunted Press Virginia attack, has done similar to the rest of college basketball as the Mountaineers roared into the Sweet 16 after blowing out both Murray State and Marshall. His 3.3 blocks per game ranks third in the country. It’s an eye-opening stat especially considering that he is the shortest player among the nation’s leaders in blocked shots.
WVU assistant coach Erik Martin, aka the “Sags Whisperer,” who works with the Mountaineer big men, calls Konate a unique talent. A member of the Cincinnati 1992 Final Four team, Martin said he’s never been around a player with such uncanny timing as a shot-blocker. 
""He’s explosive but we’ve had better athletes,” Martin says, adding that Konate doesn’t have the freak of nature type of athleticism that former Cincy big man Kenyon Martin had. “Kenyon had really elite (explosion). If you blink your eyes he’s really up above the rim. I’ve been around and played all over the world, I’ve never seen anyone who had a quicker jump. Sags isn’t like that. He’s gonna gather himself. He’s bigger than Kenyon and he has huge, strong mitts. I’ve never seen anybody block two-hand shots like that. I wasn’t around with the Bill Russell era. It’s one thing to block a guys dunk but to do it with two hands, that’s just something you don’t see. You know how much confidence you have to have to try and do that? A split second earlier or later and you’re getting dunked on.
""Sags’ blocks are at the rim which you rarely see anywhere because guys are always worried about getting dunked on. He’s figured out a way to meet guys at that time.""
Asked how Konate’s figured this out, Martin traces it back to the sophomore’s upbringing in Mali, Africa. Konate grew up playing soccer and said he only started playing basketball in 2014.
""Last year, a guy from Texas (Jarrett Allen) dunked right on top of Sags,” says Martin. ""It was like ESPN’s Dunk of the Week. It didn’t bother him one bit. Most kids who are raised in America would be (crushed).”
Konate doesn’t get hung up dreading some kind of self-esteem stigma. 
“For me, I just don’t really get into those things. ‘Oh, they’re gonna dunk on me and I’m gonna be on SportsCenter.’ I don’t really care about that,” he says. ""It’s just a mindset. Whether you’re gonna get dunked on or you’re gonna block their shot, it’s out of my mind if they dunk on me. It’s behind me. I got dunked on so many times last year. I learn from it. This year, it’s a lot less.
""That was how I was raised. I grew up with 13 brothers and sisters. It was more competitive. My brother and my dad always told me, the past is the past. You just gotta keep it going forward."" 
Konate has come a long way indeed. 
Like Jevon Carter, who last season won national defensive player of the year honors, Konate came to Morgantown as an unheralded recruit. Like five of his brothers, Konate—one of 14 children—came to the U.S. to pursue education and basketball opportunities. He played at a Class A high school near the Pennsylvania-Ohio border. 
“There weren’t a whole lot of people recruiting him,” says Larry Harrison, the WVU assistant who recruited him. ""He played for a local AAU team, played for a small high school, so he didn’t have a lot of exposure. Wichita State, Penn State recruited him. Pitt just didn’t recruit him. We had friend who went to Walsh College when Huggs (Bob Huggins) was the coach there. He called me and said there was a kid that I needed to take a look at.”
After Harrison returned from watching Konate play, Harrison admitted to Huggins that he wasn’t sure how good the prospect was. But he was big and he was very athletic and they should keep recruiting him.
""In high school he wasn’t blocking shots like this, but now the way he’s blocking shots, it’s become his art,” says Harrison.
Konate’s development is rooted in the same place that many other Mountaineer sleeper success stories are—the weight room. In less than two years, he’s re-shaped his physique and packed on almost 20 pounds. He’s now 258 pounds.
""I remember giving him 30-pound dumbbells and I thought he was gonna drop 'em on his face,” says Andy Kettler, WVU’s strength coach. ""The idea was simple. Teach accountability. Teach him to work hard. Just keep it simple. Take a handful of simple things and build on it.”
Konate now can do single-arm bench press with 115-pounders for sets of 10. Kettler says Konate’s vertical jump also is well over 35 inches.
""My thing to him is he’s 6'8"", not 7'0"". 'You need to become the strongest player in the country so that you can separate yourself against those 6'11"" guys,' because he is our center.”
Fran Fraschilla was calling that Texas-WVU game last season when Konate was on the wrong end of ESPN’s Dunk of the Week.
""That was me,” says Fraschilla. “I was screaming, 'THE DUNK OF THE YEAR! THE DUNK OF THE YEAR!!’” But it just rolled off (Konate’s) back. He has a pride in blocking shots. If you dunk on me, great. It’s very similar to what we remember about (Dikembe) Mutombo and (Patrick) Ewing. It’s not something to show somebody up. It’s more this is my thing. Every great shot blocker has to have pride in blocking shots. It becomes part of their identity. ‘You may score on me but I’m waiting for you to come at me again.’”
Fraschilla also credits Martin—the ""Sags Whisperer"" for also helping develop him into a capable low-post scorer and managing his emotional on-court fire in a young player that has a bit of a temper. 
Fraschilla, who has spent 39 years in coaching and broadcasting basketball, says there are four elements to what he describes as the art of shot-blocking.
• Pride
• Body Positioning
• Timing 
• Instinct
In regards to Konate’s body positioning, Fraschilla has observed that the WVU big man, if he’s not going for the two-handed rejection, always tries to block the ball with his inside hand (the one closest to the rim) depending on which side the offensive player is coming from, to keep his body away and eliminate body contact. From a timing perspective, Konate never leaves his feet before the offensive player does, Fraschilla says. “He has a great ability to stay vertical.”
Despite the penchant for two-handed blocks, Konate never played volleyball growing up.
""My teammates say, 'Sags you block the ball and it goes out of bounds. You gotta grab it or tip it to us.’ I said, ‘Oh, yeah, that sounds really good.’”
Konate says he likes to watch film of Ben Wallace, an undersized post player who became a four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Asked where his timing comes from, Konate says he just doesn’t know.
“It might be natural,"" he says. ""It’s just a mindset.""

Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue has taken a temporary leave of absence as head coach due to health issues, the team announced. Associate head coach Larry Drew will take over in Lue's absence.
Lue will be on a one-week plan to address his health issues and could return to the bench next week, according to David Aldridge of TNT.
""After many conversations with our doctors and Koby and much thought given to what is best for the team and my health, I need to step back from coaching for the time being and focus on trying to establish a stronger and healthier foundation from which to coach for the rest of the season,"" Lue said in a statement. ""I have had chest pains and other troubling symptoms, compounded by a loss of sleep, throughout the year. Despite a battery of tests, there have been no conclusions as to what the exact issue is. While I have tried to work through it, the last thing I want is for it to affect the team. I am going to use this time to focus on a prescribed routine and medication, which has previously been difficult to start in the midst of a season. My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself so I can continue to lead this team to the Championship we are all working towards. I greatly appreciate Dan Gilbert, Koby Altman, our medical team and the organization's support throughout.""
On Saturday, Lue remained in the locker room during the second half of the Cavaliers' win over the Chicago Bulls due to the illness.
Lue is in his third season as the Cavaliers' head coach.
""""It's like losing one of your best players, obviously - the guy who's the captain of our ship, who's been running things the past three years,"" LeBron James told reporters.
Watch James' comments below:

The Cavaliers are 40–29 on the seasons and sit in third place in the Eastern Conference behind the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics.

              Penny Hardaway reportedly agrees to be the next coach at Memphis
            
            
Former Memphis guard Anfernee ""Penny"" Hardaway has agreed to a deal to become the school's next head men's basketball coach, reports ESPN.com.
Hardaway would replace Tubby Smith, who was fired last week after two seasons at the school. The team failed to make the NCAA tournament during his tenure.
According to the report, Hardaway, who has coached in the AAU circuit and led Memphis East High School to three straight state titles, will be introduced on Tuesday.
Hardaway played for the Tigers, then know as Memphis State, from 1991-93 and was named an AP first-team All-American before being drafted by No. 3 overall in the 1993 NBA draft.
The 46-year-old Hardaway played 15 seasons in the NBA with four different teams, most notably the Orlando Magic.
Hardaway was a four-time All-Star and made the All–NBA first team two times while being paired with Shaquille O'Neal in the mid-1990's.

              Three Warriors starters are already out with injuries. 
            
            
Draymond Green joined the lengthy list of injured Warriors stars on Monday night. 
Green exited Golden State’s game against the Spurs in the first half and the team announced that he would not return. ESPN’s Doris Burke said it was a “midsection contusion.”
The Warriors are already without their three best players—Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Curry has a sprained ankle, Durant has a sore rib and Thompson broke his thumb. The fifth member of the starting lineup, Zaza Pachulia, is playing through a right shoulder contusion. 
The injuries don’t stop there, either. Omri Casspi is out with a sprained ankle and four more players are playing through injuries, including Patrick McCaw, who has a fractured wrist.

              UMBC will do all it can to keep head coach Ryan Odom.
            
            
UMBC plans to offer head coach Ryan Odom a new long-term contract that includes a salary increase, athletic director Tim Hall tells ESPN. 
""We need to do within our realm what we can,"" Hall told ESPN. ""We obviously can't do what the Power 5 schools can do, or anything near that. I think at some point Ryan wants to do it on a bigger stage. I'm just hoping it's down the road instead of now.""
Odom's name has surfaced as a possible candidate for coaching vacancies after he led UMBC to victory against Virginia in the first round of the NCAA tournament and became the first No. 16 seed to defeat a No. 1 seed in NCAA tournament history. The Retrievers lost to Kansas State 50–43 in the Round of 32.
Odom, 43, just wrapped up his second season as UMBC's head coach. He went 21–13 in his first season and then 25–11 this season. He previously coached at Charlotte. When he accepted the UMBC job, Odom signed a seven-year deal where he earns $230K per season.
East Carolina is one of the schools that has reportedly been interested in Odom, according to USA Today. 
Sports Illustrated commemorated the historic upset by featuring UMBC on a digital cover of the magazine.

              BBC says that Navratilova and McEnroe's roles are not comparable. 
            
            
In a BBC Panorama report titled ""Britain's Equal Pay Scandal,"" Martina Navratilova says she is ""angry"" over BBC's wage gap between her £15,000 salary and John McEnroe's reported £150,000 earnings for Wimbledon broadcasts.
McEnroe was listed on a list of the network's highest-paid personalities. Navratilova claims that she was told that she was receiving a comparable amount to the men with a similar role.
Here's what Navratilova said in a clip from the show:
""It's hard to really compare exactly because some people work longer days, maybe a few more programs whatever but overall, it was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least £150,000,"" Navratilova says. ""I get about £15,000 for Wimbledon and unless John McEnroe's doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon, he's getting at least 10 times as much money than I am for very comparable work.""
""I mean, it's shocking. If really this happens to me then, you know for it's a part-time job, it's two weeks of my life but for the women that work there full-time, maybe the discrepancy's not that large but it adds up over a lifetime. It adds up to an amazing amount of money. So it's extremely unfair and you know it makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this.""
""John McEnroe makes at least £150,000 - I get about £15,000 for Wimbledon.""Former tennis champion and Wimbledon commentator @martina talks about the pay inequality at the BBC #BBCPanorama pic.twitter.com/qKMUnsypS0
BBC responded with a statement to Panorama that said McEnroe and Navratilova perform different roles on the team and that ""John's role is of a different scale, scope and commitment."" The network added that ""they are simply not comparable.""
The full statement from the BBC can be read below:

The Panorama report estimated that McEnroe made 30 appearances on last year's Wimbledon broadcast while Navratilova made 10.

STORRS, Conn. – Napheesa Collier scored 23 points and top-seeded UConn beat in-state neighbor Quinnipiac 71-46 on Monday night to advance to a 25th straight Sweet 16.
p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Verdana; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000}span.s1 {font-kerning: none}
Azura Stevens added 14 points and Kia Nurse chipped in with 13 for the Huskies (34-0), who found themselves in a much slower-paced game than their 140-52 first-round rout of Saint Francis (Pa.).
But Connecticut was not threatened in this one either. They opened with a 9-2 run and never trailed.
Jen Fay had 12 points to lead the ninth-seeded Bobcats (28-6), who saw their school-record 23-game winning streak snapped.
Quinnipiac got plenty of open looks, but hit just four of 24 shots from 3-point range, including just one of 12 from in the first half.
UConn shot 59 percent, held Quinnipiac to just 17 baskets on 56 shots (30 percent), and led 33-18 at halftime.
A pair of free throws by Stevens gave the Huskies their first 20-point lead late in the third quarter and it was 54-31 going into the fourth.
The Huskies were too big for the Bobcats, who had no player on the court over 6-foot tall.
They outrebounded Quinnipiac 33-21 and outscored them 28-14 in the paint.
It was just the second meeting between the two programs. The first, a 117-20 UConn win, came almost 20 years ago after Quinnipiac made the jump from Division II.
BIG PICTURE
Quinnipiac: Senior Carly Fabbri, the coach’s daughter, finishes her career with a 113-26 record and three trips to the NCAA Tournament, where teams she was on went 3-3. … This is the schools fourth trip to the tournament, all since 2015.
UConn: The win was the Huskies 115th in their NCAA Tournament history against 18 defeats. The 86.5 winning percentage is the best in the history of the NCAA Tournament… UConn’s current 34-game winning streak is the longest in the nation and 12th longest in NCAA history… UConn’s seniors will end their careers undefeated (79-0) in Connecticut, including 32-0 at Gampel Pavilion.
UP NEXT
UConn plays fifth-seeded Duke on Saturday in Albany, New York. The Huskies have not played a game outside the state of Connecticut since their penultimate win of the regular season at SMU on Feb. 24.

Purdue Boilermakers coach Matt Painter reiterated Monday that getting a brace approved is not the issue with Isaac Haas' playing status.

WEST LAFAYETTE — Purdue basketball coach Matt Painter has done his best to bring a dose of reality to the chances that senior center Isaac Haas plays again this season.
The Boilermakers ruled Haas out for the season after he fractured his right elbow in last Friday's opening-round victory over Cal State Fullerton. Painter keeps telling anyone who will listen that Haas can't play basketball with a broken elbow — regardless of whether or not the NCAA approves whatever brace he tries to wear.
But when Painter was asked Monday — half-jokingly, it seemed — about whether some Purdue engineering students might try and come up with a solution, Painter said he heard ""they might be trying to do that.""
The Journal & Courier confirmed that Purdue sports medicine has reached out to Purdue mechanical engineering about working on a solution. Doug Boersma, associate athletic director for sports medicine, declined comment, citing student-athlete medical privacy laws.
However, Painter reiterated that the brace is really the least of Haas' concerns.
JACQUIL TAYLOR: Purdue reserve helped make his Sweet 16 homecoming happen
""He has the best brace you can possibly have on that they didn't approve,"" Painter said. ""So if he has the best brace possible and he can't shoot a right-handed free throw, this brace isn't going to be better. It's just going to be one that's a little bit less (bulky) and it's going to get approved.
""He still has a broken elbow.""

    The Boilermakers senior center on his elbow injury and watching his teammates win their 30th game and advance to the Sweet 16.
    Nathan Baird/Journal & Courier
Painter said Haas will need to have a pin put in the arm when he eventually undergoes surgery. He hoped the 7-2, 290-pound third-team All-Big Ten Conference selection would be healthy enough to participate in the Las Vegas NBA Summer League, held July 6-17.
Painter also expressed concern about the elbow's long-term health should Haas fall on it in competition — and the big man is no stranger to tumbling in the lane.
""You fracture your elbow, it's really hard,"" Painter said. ""It makes for good conversation because he wants to play. I think that's a good sign — that he wants to play.
""I don't think the key is him getting some other apparatus that gets approved by the NCAA. You've still got to be able to shoot a right-handed free throw. You've got to be able to rebound with two hands. You've got to be able to catch the ball.""
Haas clearly could do none of those things while going through warm-ups prior to Purdue's 76-73 victory over Butler",sports

    SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Scott Gleeson looks at five teams that have made improbable runs to the second weekend of March Madness.
    USA TODAY Sports

Then there were 16. 
The first weekend wasn't short on madness, with the No. 1 overall seed, Virginia, getting bounced in the first round by 16th-seeded Cinderella Maryland Baltimore County. 
But now the remaining contenders — or pretenders — are ready to fight in the second weekend for a trip to the Final Four.
Which teams are hottest? Which teams have the best matchup or the most favorable path to San Antonio? USA TODAY Sports ranks the 16 remaining teams in this year's NCAA tournament — in order of national title-winning potential. 
The Blue Devils were firing on all cylinders in Saturday's convincing second-round win over Rhode Island. With Michigan State gone and Kansas not at its best, the seemingly cluttered Midwest Region now feels like No. 2 seed Duke's to lose. Coach Mike Krzyzewski has brought talented Duke teams to the Sweet 16 plenty of times, but rarely has he done so with an unstoppable asset in the form of 6-10 freshman forward Marvin Bagley III. He averages a double-double and injects energy into the rest of the team, which is no normal cast of role players. All-American senior guard Grayson Allen provides the veteran presence, while point guard Trevon Duval has been an X-Factor for this group with his facilitating and timely scoring.

KEY TAKEAWAYS: What Sunday's second-round games revealed
NCAA BRACKET: How 68 teams were trimmed to 16
This team lost four consecutive games during a horrid February stretch to fall out of the SEC regular-season title race. However, they have come on strong in March, starting with an SEC tournament title followed by two impressive wins in the NCAA tournament. The difference has been on the defensive end, where the Wildcats have put the clamps on opponents and made that a priority. 
Coach John Calipari has a mastery of getting teenagers to gel as a unit and play like veterans in this one-and-done era. Against an experienced Buffalo team, it was both the Wildcats' jump-out-of-the-gym athleticism and locked-in defensive effort that made it a blowout. Kevin Knox can score in a variety of ways (three-pointers, jump hooks or floaters), while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has given this group a go-to presence (he had 27 points and six assists vs. Buffalo). With the top four seeds gone in the chaotic South Region, the fifth-seeded Wildcats are the clear-cut favorite.

Villanova found another gear against Alabama in the second round, and has proven it can be one of the most unbeatable teams in this tournament. But the formula to be at that level takes stellar defense and a high percentage of three-point shooting (the Wildcats made 31 threes in the first two rounds). National player of the year Jalen Brunson (19.1 ppg, 4.7 apg) and NBA prospect Mikal Bridges make for a strong tandem, and give this team a significant edge in late-game situations. But it's the role players and glue guys who help this team tick. The most important of those is Donte DiVincenzo, who brings instant offense off the bench and had five first-half triples to fuel this team against 'Bama. Coach Jay Wright has as much, if not more, talent on this roster than he did in 2016 when 'Nova cut down the nets in April.  
Buzzer-beaters, such as freshman Jordan Poole's 30-foot dagger to sink Houston on Saturday, can often coincide with a lucky-to-be-there factor.  That's far from the case here. Michigan has been a Final Four threat since late February, playing its best basketball late in the season en route to a Big Ten tournament championship. Coach John Beilein has the best defensive team he's ever had in Ann Arbor, and that's been wholly necessary to advance to the second weekend. The balanced offense hasn't been fluent, with poor three-point shooting in the tournament (28% in two games) and leading scorer Mo Wagner (14.2 ppg, 7.1 rpg) averaging just 8.5 points a game. Michigan has been one of the least impressive Sweet 16 teams, and yet, its title chances are still higher based on the overall product and net-cutting potential. 
In reality, Kansas has overachieved this season given its lack of size and perimeter shooting. Winning the Big 12 regular season and tournament titles, as well as surviving the first two rounds without a 100% healthy Udoka Azubuike (KU's only true big man), speak volumes for why the Final Four wall coach Bill Self's program has faced the past two NCAA tournaments will fall this year. Big 12 player of the year Devonte' Graham (17.4 ppg, 7.5 apg) makes this team tick. As usual, Graham and Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk will need to shoot well for this team to win. Combo guard Malik Newman's 28 points in a win over Seton Hall couldn't have come at a better time. 
Texas A&M's unexpected drubbing of North Carolina can be credited to two things: UNC's horrid shooting day and the Aggies' imposing front line of Tyler Davis, Robert Williams and DJ Hogg wreaking havoc. Hogg had 14 points off three three-pointers, while the twin towers of Davis and Williams combined for 10-for-12 shooting, 21 rebounds and eight blocks. While other teams need their guards to excel to win, Texas A&M has used a frontcourt formula to win, while limiting two of the best guard-oriented teams in the Dance — Providence and North Carolina.

Clemson wasn't exactly a hot team entering this tournament. But after two extremely dominant performances against New Mexico State and Auburn, that's changed big time. The Tigers' 31-point shellacking of Auburn set an NCAA tourney record for margin of victory. Hot shooting and solid all-around defense are the key ingredients for coach Brad Brownell's group, which has gotten steady production from senior guard Gabe DeVoe (22 points in both NCAA tourney wins). 
The Red Raiders have an active defense and two offensive weapons most teams don't have in do-everything guard Keenan Evans and dynamic forward Zhaire Smith. Evans was clutch down the stretch against Florida, and is a game-changer with his playmaking. Protecting the paint will be a must for coach Chris Beard's team against Purdue, as the Red Raiders coughed up 38 points near the rim against the Gators. Guarding the perimeter is a strong suit, with TTU ranking 14th nationally in field goal percentage. 
Of all the teams from the nation's best conference, the Big 12, West Virginia has been most impressive in two punishing wins against upstart mid-majors Murray State and Marshall. But much of the Mountaineers' dominant performance against inferior teams has been based on that tempo-shifting press coach Bob Huggins' teams perfect. This team forces a lot of turnovers but likely won't have the same type of success against Villanova's guards. All-American guard Jevon Carter frustrated Oklahoma's Trae Young, Kansas' Graham and Texas Tech's Evans in Big 12 play. Will he have the same success against Villanova's Brunson? WVU will need that and Carter's perimeter shooting to win.
Purdue would be way higher on this list if 7-footer Isaac Haas didn't get hurt, but the way the Boilermakers showed resolve in a Sweet 16-clinching victory over Butler provides promise. That win was made possible by the clutch dagger of veteran Dakota Mathias in the closing minutes, and that type of play illuminates this team's experience factor. Plus, Carsen Edwards and Vincent Edwards are offensive lightning rods that must help this defensively-themed team avoid major scoring lulls. Matt Haarms, Haas' 7-foot replacement (where does Matt Painter get these tall dudes?) might be the biggest X-Factor of the Sweet 16. 
Loyola provides a Hoosiers feel to the Sweet 16 with its floor spacing and late-game heroics (the Ramblers advanced this far off two last-second game-winners, against Miami and Tennessee). But what really makes this team the ultimate threat as a mid-major are its sum-of-all-parts philosophy and team cohesion. There's no superstar, and that's by design. Coach Porter Moser has had two players — Donte Ingram and Clayton Custer —nail buzzer-beaters. And he's got three or four more capable of doing it in another close-game situation. Cinderella luck? Or a damn good system. Why this No. 11 seed can go way further than expected: A defense that ranks in the top five nationally. 
Nevada has presented a split personality in this NCAA tournament: The team that's outmatched and stiff for more than half the game, and the team that's possessed during a monstrous comeback and capable of becoming the worst-seeded team since UConn in 2014 to win the whole thing. Coach Eric Musselman's team has provided two heart-pumping comebacks -- a 14-point comeback overtime win over Texas in the first round and then a thrilling 22-point comeback to oust No. 2 seed Cincinnati on Sunday. Caleb Martin and Cody Martin, 6-7 twins with multidimensional skill sets, give Nevada a dangerous 1-2 punch. One key stat: the Wolf Pack ranks second nationally in assist-to-turnover ratio. Taking care of the ball bodes well for any team in March. 
Freshman Zach Norvell Jr. has been on an absolute tear and gives the 'Zags, much less talented than last year's national runner-up team, a puncher's chance of getting to the Final Four. His 28 points (off six threes) and 12 rebounds were instrumental in helping Gonzaga dump Ohio State in the second round. The mainstay from Mark Few's breakthrough team last year, Johnathan Williams, is a 6-9 forward who can pose major matchup problems. Rui Hachimura's 25 points off the bench against Ohio State showed Few has a bigger arsenal than expected. Free-throw shooting has been a headache for this team, and that will have to change for any more wins in March. 
FSU played exceptionally well in knocking off No. 1 seed Xavier, giving  it the most impressive tournament win of any Sweet 16 team.  Leonard Hamilton's squad dispatched the Musketeers thanks to  an 18-4 run that started on defense and was finished by a determined offense led by vets Terance Mann and Phil Cofer. The Seminoles have the deepest bench of the remaining teams.
At first glance, the ninth-seeded Wildcats don't have the offensive repertoire to compete with Kentucky, and were the beneficiary of catching 16th-seeded UMBC when the Cinderella magic ran out. So maybe KSU would be more respected if it beat top-seeded Virginia to get here. But there was a lot to take from a defensively-sound win over the upstart Retrievers. It showed, ironically, how Kansas State has channeled Virginia with not-so-pretty wins  behind stellar defense and just enough offense. That was the blueprint in the first round against a potent Creighton offense, too. Barry Brown and Dean Wade will have to shoot well for Bruce Weber's team to advance. 
Coach Jim Boeheim's 2-3 zone is not easy to prepare for, and it took all three teams 'Cuse has beaten — Arizona State, TCU and Michigan State — out of their offensive rhythms. But that likely won't be the case against a Duke team that can handle the Orange's length and shoot the lights out. The Blue Devils are used to seeing the 2-3. The reason Syracuse is last here is because of limited offensive options. Only three players can score, and no matter how great the defense is, there's only so much Tyus Battle (19.3 ppg) can do to counter another team's scoring bursts. The No. 11 seed deserves to be in this Sweet 16, but is nowhere near as good as 2016's surprise Final Four squad.

Tight end played his first four seasons with the Detroit Lions

    Insiders Stephen Holder and Zak Keefer discuss the upcoming free agency and NFL draft.

INDIANAPOLIS – Eric Ebron spent four seasons in Detroit, where his career began as a first-round pick  in 2014.
But after the free-agent tight end signed a two-year contract for a reported $15 million with the Colts on Monday night, all he wanted to talk about was Indianapolis.
“I fell in love with the coaching staff and I fell in love with the GM,” Ebron said on a conference call shortly after signing his deal. “That’s what kind of pushed the envelope for me to want to be here. Everyone showed love and a lot of support for my game and my family and the things that I wanted to accomplish. It was something I prayed on and I asked for a symbol, a light, and that’s exactly what happened on this visit. It was a no brainer after that.”
Just like that, the Colts got themselves another target for quarterback Andrew Luck, who could use the help given the Colts’ lack of proven talent at wide receiver. Ebron, 6-4 and 253 pounds, gives the Colts a versatile and athletic tight end who provides options for coach Frank Reich’s offense – a scheme that might make heavy use of tight ends.
Bradley Chubb: What Zak Keefer learned from pass rusher's pro day
More to come?: Options for the Colts among remaining free agents
Ebron was happy to discuss all the possibilities he has in Indianapolis, but he was reticent when asked about the Lions. 
Less than a week after being released, Ebron made it clear he had little to say about Detroit. In doing so, he spoke volumes.
“I really have nothing to put in perspective on what happened there,” he said. “I’m on a totally different team and I have nothing to say about the organization. I’m really thankful for them blessing me with an opportunity to play. But I really have nothing to say about the organization.”
Ebron is coming off a 53-catch season in 2017, the second-most receptions of his career. He also played in all 16 games for the first time in his career. Ebron’s 53 catches last season would have been ranked third on the Colts behind only fellow tight end Jack Doyle (80) and receiver T.Y. Hilton (57).
Ebron was oft criticized in Detroit for dropped passes, but his drops fell sharply last season. The Colts hope  the change in scenery will help that trend continue. 
With Doyle, Ebron and returner Erik Swoope on board, the Colts could have a formidable unit. Swoope will be looking to bounce back after spending last season on injured reserve with a knee injury.",sports

Hall of Famer Spencer Haywood talks about race in a discussion about paying college basketball players.

Hall of Fame basketball player Spencer Haywood told Sporting News that he sees ""a tinge of slavery"" in the treatment of college basketball players.
Haywood, the leading scorer on the United States' 1968 Olympic basketball team, told the website that he agreed with a sentiment expressed late last month by Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy, that there's often a racial component to arguments against paying college basketball players.
""Let’s think about it,"" Haywood told Sporting News in a story published Monday. ""If you have 11 blacks on your team and you are say, in Kentucky, and they’re creating all this wealth but not getting paid? It does have a tinge of slavery.
""It is what it is. It is very racist because they’re not helping the communities where those kids come from, Chicago and Detroit and so on.""

Haywood, 68, spent a dozen years in the league with five different teams and was a four-time NBA All-Star. He is perhaps best known for challenging the league's eligibility rules in court, bringing an anti-trust lawsuit against the NBA that was decided by the Supreme Court in 1971.
Haywood told Sporting News that he see a double-standard in college basketball today because coaches are allowed to move freely, and often receive raises, while players are penalized for transferring schools. He also told the website that he views the NCAA's full scholarship offers to men's basketball players as insufficient compensation, given the television and ticket revenues they generate for both their schools and the NCAA.
""You can’t expect people to continue to work for nothing on a false hope of, 'Well this is about education, we are getting you an education, we will feed you,'"" Haywood told Sporting News. ""It sounds a little like 400 years ago, like slavery. 'Stay in your hut. Stay in that little house. We’ll give you some food. You do all of the work. All of it. And I am telling you that I will take care of you.'""

Gronkowski and Evans were ultimately suspended for one game by the NFL for their actions, but it seemed incredulous that neither was immediately ejected by the on-site officials, who exclusively hold the power to disqualify a player under the current system.
If the new proposal passes, there will be another layer of discipline in play, supported by instant replay reviews.
“We are looking to address what’s obvious to coaches, players and fans,” Vincent said.
The rule could also be used, Vincent added, to identify culprits during brawls. An ejection would not prohibit the league from issuing a subsequent suspension.
Referees sometimes carry the philosophy that rather than ejecting key players — see Odell Beckham vs. Josh Norman, circa 2015 — they would allow the league office to handle the discipline.
NFL owners will meet next week in Orlando, and 24 of them would have  to approve for the new measure to go into effect.
The competition committee is also crafting a rule for consideration that would provide more clarity for what constitutes a catch, including a tweak of the language. And, in concert with increasing efforts to address safety concerns, it's pushing a point of emphasis (which won’t require a vote) that would provide for more protection of quarterbacks or ball carriers when they give themselves up on a play. Another point calls for quicker whistles to prevent unnecessary shots on players halted by a pileup.

    SportsPulse: Martin Rogers believes the World Cup group stage is filled with plenty of drama, potential Cinderella stories and star-studded matchups. So much so you'll forget the U.S. isn't in it.

What if the biggest and most painful upset in United States soccer history isn't the loss in Trinidad and Tobago in October that cost it a World Cup place? What if it is still to come?
If there is one thing that has made the American soccer community feel fractionally better about the men’s national team’s absence from this summer grand global tournament, it is the idea that hosting the event in 2026 is a lock.
The problem is, that it isn’t. Not any longer.
2026 World Cup bid: North American organizers downplay Trump factor
More: Morocco 2026 World Cup bid: $16B for venues, infrastructure
More: Phoenix Rising unveils renderings of proposed MLS stadium
On June 13, a day before the World Cup begins, soccer bureaucrats from around the planet will meet in Moscow to cast a vote. They will be selecting which nation or nations gets to stage the 2026 World Cup, which has boiled down to a fight between a three-pronged bid from USA/Mexico/Canada against an underdog campaign from the North African nation of Morocco.
The triple-headed bid has been an overwhelming favorite since it launched in April but has recently lost ground. According to multiple news media outlets from around the world, several factors have combined to boost Morocco’s chances, at the expense of the effort that would see the U.S. host 60 out of 80 games.
An executive from a national federation with FIFA voting rights told USA TODAY Sports that the North American bid is suffering because it is not seen as equally divided among the three countries, while Morroco has been ""smart"" and ""has an answer for everything."" 
The executive was not authorized to speak publicly and thus requested anonymity.
Other issues impacting North American prospects that are mentioned around the globe include the incendiary presidency of Donald Trump, high-profile gun violence in the U.S., the forceful manner in which U.S. authorities have sought to crack down on FIFA corruption, the fact that the U.S. hosted a World Cup as recently as 1994 and a raft of logistical factors.
The biggest pluses for the three-way bid are rooted in finance. It is widely agreed that a World Cup in 2026 staged primarily in the U.S., with a suggested 10 games going to both Canada and Mexico, would be the most profitable in history.
Infrastructure is not an issue, with world class airports and stadiums capable of comfortably shouldering the burden of a tournament that increases to 48 for the 2026 edition.
But Morocco is effectively playing the role of spoiler, and to this point, is doing it well. For each highlight USA/Mexico/Canada puts forward, it has a convincing counterpoint.
For example, splitting the tournament into three countries is a nice idea that reaches a huge area and fan base. Yet Morocco’s bid implies that such a framework would be unwieldy, and inconvenient for fans. Its focus on extolling the compact nature of a Moroccan-based tournament, where most travel would be by rail or short commuter flight, is no accident.
The U.S. in particular, has a swath of big cities with giant stadiums ready to serve as one of the host venues. Morocco has instead picked its locations to correlate to major tourist sites of historical significance or natural beauty, and is putting forward a more aesthetic and cultural spiel.
Morocco is also making a big play of the fact that it is on the same time zone as Western Europe and Africa, which accounts for a huge chunk of soccer’s global audience and will feature at least 25 teams in the competition.
All things considered, the USA/Mexico/Canada bid is clearly stronger on its merits, but that doesn’t always mean a lot in the weird and wacky world of FIFA. If regional voting packs stick together (Africa has 54 votes) and there is enough anti-U.S. feeling to steer some soccer politicos down a different path, then the tough times for American soccer may continue.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- The New England Patriots are acquiring receiver/returner Cordarrelle Patterson from the Oakland Raiders in a trade, with the teams swapping late-round draft picks, the Raiders announced Monday.
The Raiders will get the 159th overall pick in next month's draft from the Patriots in exchange for Patterson and the 210th overall pick.
Editor's PicksCordarelle Patterson could replace Dion Lewis as top kickoff returnerAs one of the fastest players in the league, Cordarelle Patterson is a wise low-risk pickup for the Patriots' special teams unit.
As one of the fastest players in the league, Cordarelle Patterson is a wise low-risk pickup for the Patriots' special teams unit.
Patterson enters the final year of his contract in 2018 and is due a non-guaranteed base salary of $3 million. He has a $250,000 workout bonus as part of the deal.
This isn't the first time the speedy Patterson has been connected to the Patriots. He entered the NFL as a first-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings in 2013 as the No. 29 overall pick that the Vikings acquired from the Patriots in a trade.
The 6-foot-2, 220-pound Patterson has 163 career receptions for 1,625 yards and seven touchdowns over his career. He has been a dangerous kickoff returner as well, with 153 returns for 4,613 yards and five touchdowns.
The Patriots' primary kickoff returner in 2017, running back Dion Lewis, signed a free-agent deal with the Tennessee Titans.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans are releasing nose tackle Sylvester Williams just one year after signing him to a three-year, $16.5 million deal. The Titans hoped Williams, 29, would adequately fill their void at nose tackle, but he didn't make as many splash plays or command the double teams that they expected. Titans general manager Jon Robinson was willing to cut ties with his signing. Williams was content with the move.

Tennessee GM Jon Robinson isn't afraid to make splashes and already has in free agency. Would the former Dolphins lineman be a cultural fit?
""I'm good. I believe in myself,"" Williams told ESPN in a text message. ""My best football is ahead of me."" Releasing Williams, a Broncos 2013 first-round pick, saves the Titans a little more than $3 million in salary-cap space while carrying a little more than $2.5 million in ""dead money"" salary charge. The release came Saturday because $2.5 million of his 2018 base salary would have been guaranteed if he was on the roster Sunday. Williams, 6-foot-2, 313 pounds, is a bit undersized for the nose tackle position, which may have hurt his ability to get off blocks. The Titans finished fourth in run defense, and Williams played 32 percent of the defensive snaps (11 starts).
This move is particularly interesting because the Titans are expected to host Ndamukong Suh on a visit this weekend after leaving the Saints, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Suh played under Titans defensive line coach Terrell Williams in Miami for the past three years.
The Titans will now need to add more defensive line depth, but they had enough cap space to make the Suh move before releasing Williams and veteran defensive lineman Karl Klug this weekend.

TAMPA, Fla. -- Alex Rodriguez thinks the New York Yankees' ""breathtaking"" offense could break records this season.
Rodriguez arrived at spring training Monday and had high praise for a lineup led by Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius. A-Rod is a team special adviser who has worked with a number of New York's younger players.
""Happy to be back and see so much talent,"" Rodriguez said Monday night. ""It's breathtaking.""
The Yankees added Stanton, the NL MVP after hitting 59 homers and driving in 132 last season, in a December trade with Miami. Judge had 52 homers and 114 RBI in winning the 2017 AL Rookie of the Year Award. Sanchez added 33 homers, and Gregorius went deep 25 times.
""I can't remember a time to see that type of lineup one-through-nine,"" Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez and Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner worked out a deal during the offseason to keep the former slugger involved with the team.
""Love to spend the rest of my life as a Yankee,"" Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez will be joining the ESPN team this season to work on Sunday Night Baseball telecasts.

MESA, Ariz. -- Right-hander Trevor Cahill and the Oakland Athletics have finalized a $1.25 million, one-year contract.
As part of the deal announced Monday, Cahill would get a $250,000 assignment bonus if traded.
The 30-year-old was 4-3 with a 4.03 ERA last season in 14 starts and seven relief appearances for San Diego and Kansas City, which acquired him on July 24. He had a $1.75 million salary and earned a $250,000 assignment bonus but fell short of a $250,000 bonus that would have been triggered by his 15th start.
Oakland drafted Cahill in the second round in 2006 with the 66th overall pick. He made his big league debut with the A's in 2009 and was an All-Star in 2010.
He has a 73-79 record with a 4.11 ERA in nine big league seasons that include time with Oakland (2009-11), Arizona (2012-14), Atlanta (2015) and the Chicago Cubs (2015-16).
To clear a roster spot, Oakland placed 26-year-old right-hander Jharel Cotton on the 60-day disabled list. Cotton is scheduled for Tommy John surgery Wednesday. He was 9-10 with a 5.58 ERA in 24 starts for the A's last year.

Kemba Walker launches a pass to Willy Hernangomez in the corner for a 3-pointer, his 17th points of the night. (0:16)
PHILADELPHIA -- With Allen Iverson watching from a suite, Joel Embiid produced yet another dominant game in a season where the 76ers' All-Star has barely practiced.
Yes, Embiid is another Philly star who sits out practice.
Unlike Iverson, whose complaints about practice are part of his legend, the suddenly sturdy 76ers big man takes extra rest with the full support of coach Brett Brown.
Embiid had 25 points and 19 rebounds and Ben Simmons had a triple-double to lead Philadelphia to a 108-94 win over the Charlotte Hornets on Monday night.
Simmons had 11 points, 12 rebounds, 15 assists and no turnovers for the Sixers, who still have a chance to finish fourth in the Eastern Conference and earn home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
The 76ers have one of the easiest schedules of any team the rest of the season. The Sixers would have to pass Washington and Indiana to grab the No. 4 seed and stave off a potential Toronto or Boston matchup for at least a round.
""Our goal is to make the playoffs,"" Brown said. ""Now, seemingly, we are pretty close to doing that. Now we all get greedy and say, 'Let's get a home court.' And I'm the captain of that new club. And it can only happen if we guard. And that's the message to our team.""
How's this for D?
The Hornets missed 17 of 21 shots in the third (going 1-for-5 on 3s) to crush their chances of stretching a seven-point halftime lead.
""Nothing matters unless we play defense,"" Brown said. ""It's how we set the tone in this program since the day I arrived.""
The 76ers have had countless dark days since Brown arrived in 2013.
The 19-, 18- and 10-win seasons that give birth to The Process have paid off this year, and the Sixers are set to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2012.
They are the favorites in the majority of their games and have become the team that now has to worry about playing down to the level of their competition.
Embiid has led the charge, playing 58 of 69 games a year after playing 31 in his rookie season. He missed his first two seasons with injuries and the Sixers have been judicious with his practice time. Embiid said he works with the medical staff to decide his schedule.
""It's the most unusual thing that I've ever experienced, that he's that capable and that talented to impact a game and be selected as a starter on the All-Star team with effectively not practicing with his team,"" Brown said. ""We're really trying to preserve his health.""
Philadelphia could never really shake Charlotte until late.
Embiid, who had nine turnovers, hit two straight 3s and JJ Redick hit one to give the Sixers a 58-56 lead in the third. Marco Belinelli hit consecutive 3s late in the third to make it 72-64. He hit one more 3 for a 10-point lead to help the Sixers beat their third straight sub.-500 team (New York, Brooklyn).
Embiid connected on one more 3 at the top of the arc to close the quarter.
Embiid made 4 of 6 3s -- not bad for a 31 percent shooter from beyond the arc this season.
""It's not like he's knocking them down, but he had it tonight,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said.
Dario Saric hit a 3 in the fourth for an 88-83 lead and Robert Covington, who scored 18 points, sealed it with Philadelphia's 16th 3 of the game for a 12-point edge late in the fourth.
""Ben was moving the ball, everybody was moving,"" Embiid said. ""That was a great effort in the second half defensively and everybody did their job.""
Kemba Walker led the Hornets, coming off a 124-101 loss to the Knicks, with 24 points. Willy Hernangomez scored 17 points off the bench in just 12 minutes in the first half to help the Hornets lead 56-49 at the break.
TIP-INS
Hornets: The Hornets made all 14 free throws in the first half. ... Hernangomez scored 15 points in the second quarter. ... Jeremy Lamb started in place of injured guard Nicolas Batum (Achilles).
76ers: The 76ers went just 3 for 4 from the free-throw line in the first half. ... The loudest ovation of the night came when Hernangomez missed two straight free throws in the third to win every fan a free fast-food treat.
CRYING FOUL
The Hornets made 24 of 30 free throws and the Sixers went just 6 of 8. Hornets center Dwight Howard, who scored 10 points and had five fouls, ripped the officiating nonetheless.
""I just thought it was crap the whole night,"" he said. ""I thought the referees did a good job of trying to keep players out of the game. ... It's not cool. I think that really got the momentum for the other team. Officiating hasn't been that bad all year. I was pretty upset about that.
""I tried to fight through it. It just kept getting worse. I never complain, I never really say nothing about refs to anybody in the media. But tonight wasn't cool.""
HE SAID IT
Simmons might need Embiid's practice schedule this deep into the season.
""Physically I feel fine, but mentally it's a little draining,"" he said.
BUZZ CITY
The 76ers held ""Barbershop Night"" on the promotional schedule and members of the organization had images of players or team logos shaved in their heads.

James Johnson fakes out Will Barton then drives for the two-handed slam in double-overtime. (0:25)
MIAMI -- They broke the stat system. That's how good Miami and Denver were -- even modern technology couldn't keep up with the Heat and Nuggets.
For 48 minutes, they went back and forth.
And one overtime wouldn't decide it, either.
Finally, after three hours, the Heat said enough. James Johnson scored a career-high 31 points, Kelly Olynyk added 30 off the bench and Miami set a franchise single-game scoring record by beating the Nuggets 149-141 in double overtime on Monday night.
""There didn't deserve to be a loser,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""Guys probably really enjoyed playing in a game like this.""
His guys did, anyway. Olynyk became the second reserve in Heat history to score 30. Wayne Ellington had 23 points, and the Heat made 20 3-pointers -- second most in franchise history.
All that comes with a serious disclaimer. There was no official box score after the game, because the system crashed in the first overtime period and crews were scrambling to determine official numbers long after the final buzzer.
While NBA stat system outages are not all that uncommon, this one seemed more severe than usual, as no official box score had showed up more than two hours after the end of the game.
What mattered most was the score -- one that moved Miami (38-33) into seventh in the Eastern Conference and left the Nuggets two games back of the last Western Conference spot.
""They just executed,"" Nuggets forward Paul Millsap said. ""They got some, I think, fluke plays and a little luck and they're at home, you know. Momentum shifted a little bit.""
Miami's point total was also an NBA season high. Houston and Oklahoma City each scored 148 in games earlier this season.
Nikola Jokic had 34 points and 14 rebounds for Denver (38-33), while Wilson Chandler added 26 for the Nuggets. Jamal Murray scored 23, and Will Barton finished with 22 for Denver.
""There's no stats. The stat machine blew up, I guess,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. ""But the only stat I cared about tonight is that I'm proud of the way we competed, I'm proud of the way we executed, I'm proud of the fact that we gave ourselves a chance.""
Neither team was at full strength. For Miami, Dwyane Wade (left hamstring strain) missed his fourth consecutive game, and Hassan Whiteside (left hip pain) sat out his fifth straight contest. Denver was without leading scorer Gary Harris, sidelined again by a strained right knee that could keep him out several more days.
Denver led 16-5 after 3½ minutes, and that was the only double-digit lead by either side for about the next three hours. It was airtight until the very final moments, almost to an absurd degree.
After one quarter, Denver led by one.
Halftime, Miami led by one.
After three, Miami still by one.
After regulation, tied.
After one overtime, still tied.
""That's as playoffs as it comes,"" Olynyk said.
Back and forth they went all night, two teams that played a one-point game at Denver back in November -- that one not being decided until Dion Waiters' missed jumper as time expired sealed the Nuggets' win. This one had even more fireworks, with the Heat missing shots at the end of regulation and the first overtime before finding a way in the second OT.
Olynyk and Johnson had all 13 Miami points in the first overtime.
""We didn't exactly want it to be like this,"" said Ellington, who rattled home a 3-pointer to start the second OT and put Miami ahead for good. ""But these are the types of games that show your character.""
TIP-INS
Nuggets: Including the franchise's ABA days, all 28 previous Nuggets teams to finish .500 or better made the playoffs. That streak seems in jeopardy now. ... Denver fell to 19-5 in games in which it scores at least 115 points. The Nuggets are now 17-30 when allowing more than 105.
Heat: It was the highest-scoring first four quarters of an overtime game in Heat history. The previous before-OT high was 115 at Golden State on Dec. 1, 2008. ... The previous scoring record was 141 points, done twice. ... A pregame moment of silence was held for the six victims of last week's bridge collapse near Florida International University.
NEVER FORGET
The Heat continue paying tributes to the 17 victims of the shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida. Spoelstra and several players spent their day off Sunday at the Parkland Rec League Basketball Championship, honoring the lives of victims Joaquin Oliver, Luke Hoyer and Alex Schacter by announcing scholarships in their names -- as well as a $500,000 donation.
ROAD TRIP
This seven-game trip for the Nuggets is their longest since a seven-gamer in the 2011-12 season. As if a late-season two-week trip wasn't tough enough, Denver's remaining schedule is brutal; after visiting Chicago on Wednesday, the Nuggets will have 10 games left -- all against teams currently in the playoff mix.

Dave McMenamin says Kevin Love will return from injury under restricted minutes against the Bucks. (1:33)
All-Star forward Kevin Love scored 18 points in his return to the Cleveland Cavaliers' lineup Monday night after missing 21 games with a broken left hand.

Tyronn Lue is taking a break from coaching the Cavaliers to focus on his health. His goal, he told ESPN, is to return in about a week.
Love went 5-for-13 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free throw line in his first game since Jan. 30. He added seven rebounds, four assists and two blocks as the Cavs beat the Bucks 124-117.
""I felt pretty good,'' he said. ""Initially, that first wind is always tough, but even after that I felt like my legs were underneath me and that I could've played a little bit more.''
Love had scans on his hand Monday morning and then went through a full practice before acting head coach Larry Drew officially announced his return.
""I thought he gave us a tremendous lift, I really did,"" Drew said. ""Not only the fact that he made some shots, but that he was pretty active defensively. We try to put a lot of emphasis on our defense but everybody knows when he's out on the floor he's capable of scoring baskets whether he's inside or out. It was just really good to have him back.""
Drew said pregame that Love would be on a minutes restriction. He played 25 minutes against Milwaukee.
Love expressed excitement on Twitter after the game about being back:
Happy to be sharing the court with my brothers again!! Been too long. Never easy to get a W... https://t.co/ZuSSwrvQ9U
— Kevin Love (@kevinlove) March 20, 2018
Love's return to the court was welcome news in the Cavs' locker room.
""First of all just having another body is great for our team,"" LeBron James said. ""Then just his basketball IQ, his familiarity with our system, he fits right back in. And his ability to stretch the floor allows opposing bigs not to just sit and clog up the paint. It's great to have him back.""
Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver, who had been listed as questionable with a foot injury, also returned to the starting lineup Monday.
Love suffered the hand injury in a Jan. 30 loss at Detroit. The initial timetable for Love, who underwent minor knee surgery on Feb. 14 and was forced to miss the All-Star Game five days later, was for him to be out two months.
Love, who underwent surgery on the same hand in October 2009, was averaging 17.9 points, 9.4 rebounds and shooting 40 percent on 3-pointers before the injury.

Not missing a beat from his starring roles with the U.S. Olympic team and Harvard University, Ryan Donato had a goal and two assists Monday night in his NHL debut for the Boston Bruins, who fell to the Columbus Blue Jackets, 5-4, in overtime.
Donato's slap shot at 14:19 of the second period tied the game at 1-1, as he one-timed a pass from Torey Krug.
Donato then got his first career assist on Riley Nash's power-play goal later in the second period, and added another on David Krejci's third-period goal that tied the game at 4-4 just 20 seconds after Columbus had taken a lead.
""During warm-ups, it kind of felt like a dream,"" said Donato, who played left wing on the No. 2 line alongside Krejci and right wing Danton Heinen. ""I didn't really get that warmed up because I was too focused on everything else and just kind of the whole situation.""
Editor's PicksTeam USA star Donato signs with BruinsLeft wing Ryan Donato, who starred for Team USA at last month's Pyeongchang Winter Games, has signed with the Boston Bruins and will play Monday night against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Left wing Ryan Donato, who starred for Team USA at last month's Pyeongchang Winter Games, has signed with the Boston Bruins and will play Monday night against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
He had originally been penciled in for third-line duty, but when right wing Rick Nash was scratched with an upper-body injury, Donato was moved up to the second line and Anton Blidh was recalled from Providence.
""It was so much faster than what I've ever seen,"" said Donato. ""But at the end of the day, it's something you can get used to. When you're playing with great players like that, it's something that will come along fast.""
Coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't pleased with the game result but had no complaints about Donato's debut.
""What's not to like tonight?"" said Cassidy. ""[He was] on the puck, making plays as advertised.""
Donato finished with six shots on goal and played 19:40, third most among Bruins forwards behind Brad Marchand and Riley Nash.
A 2014 second-round draft pick, Donato, 21, is from the Boston area and is the son of former Bruin and current Harvard coach Ted Donato, who didn't score his first career goal until his second game with the Bruins.
Ryan Donato, who signed a two-year contract Sunday, tied for the lead in goals among all Olympians with five goals in five games and led Team USA with six points. Coincidentally, the Bruins honored U.S. Olympians from New England before the game, with Donato taking part in a ceremonial puck drop.
As a junior, Donato led Harvard with 26 goals and 43 points in 29 games this past season and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the NCAA's top player. He became available to sign after the Crimson were eliminated in the ECAC semifinals by Clarkson 5-4 in overtime Friday night.
Patrice Bergeron, out with a broken foot, said he remembers beginning his career playing with Ted Donato.
""Doesn't make me feel any younger. When I was an 18-year-old coming in I was playing with his dad,"" said Bergeron, 32. ""That first year [Ryan] was skating in practice out there as a young kid. Now he's in the locker room and he's gonna be part of the team; it's definitely different.
""Comes from a great family ... his dad was so nice to me from training camp on. I felt pretty lucky to have great veterans like I did, and I'll try to do the same thing for them.""
The Bruins have been hit hard by injuries, with several forwards sidelined in addition to Nash and Bergeron, who was back on skates at Monday's practice and could travel with the team on the upcoming road trip.
Jake DeBrusk has missed the past three games with an upper-body injury. David Backes took 18 stitches to his right leg after being hit by a skate blade Saturday night.
The Bruins, who are second in the Eastern Conference with 99 points, have also been missing rookie defenseman Charlie McAvoy (knee injury) and captain Zdeno Chara (upper-body injury). Another defenseman, Adam McQuaid, left Monday's game in the third period with an injury.

BUFFALO, N.Y. --  Predators stalwart Pekka Rinne briefly stopped to marvel when informed of the elite NHL goaltending company he joined in becoming a three-time 40-game winner -- and after a shutout, no less.
Only six players -- Martin Brodeur and Terry Sawchuk, among them -- had previously done that.
""When you say that, it sounds pretty cool,"" Rinne said, after stopping 35 shots in a 4-0 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Monday night. ""Those guys are legends of this game. They've done so much not only for the game of hockey but for the position of being a goalie. That's great. That's a credit to my teammates, big time, and also my coaching staff.""
Rinne has been nearly unbeatable in winning his 11th straight game and improving to 40-9-4. And the 12-year veteran is carrying the NHL-leading Predators along with him in approaching numerous franchise milestones.
Nashville set a team record by extending its point streak to 15 games (14-0-1). And the Predators won their ninth consecutive road game as part of a run in which they're 12-0-3 in their past 15 to break yet another team record.
""He's unbelievable,"" teammate Ryan Johansen said of Rinne. ""In our opinion, he's been the most valuable player for us.""
The rest of the Predators have been no slouches during a stretch in which they haven't lost in regulation since a 3-1 setback against Detroit on Feb. 17.
Johansen and Mike Fisher scored goals 4:34 apart in the second period. Filip Forsberg and Ryan Hartman then sealed it by scoring in the final four minutes.
First-year Sabres coach Phil Housley could only tip his hat to Nashville, where he spent the previous four seasons as an assistant. Though the final score didn't reflect it, Housley was pleased with how the Sabresm last in the Eastern Conference, held their own against the Predators for mostly two periods.
""I can't fault the way our guys played. I thought they brought their best game,"" Housley said. ""One thing I'd like to see our guys do better is stop in front of the net and start pounding it, whacking at some loose pucks there.""
Then again, Housley is all too familiar with how well Rinne can play when he gets into a groove.
""If we could rattle him early and get him off his game a little bit, that's the time we've got to take advantage,"" Housley said. ""But once he settles in, he's tough to beat.""
Buffalo's Jack Eichel burst up the left side and behind the Predators' defense to drive across the crease only to have his shot stopped by Rinne's left pad four minutes in. Rinne also got an assist from teammate Kevin Fiala, who got his stick out to stop Justin Bailey's attempt to tap in a bouncing puck in the crease.
Rinne kicked out his right pad to foil Nicholas Baptiste's snap shot from the slot 2:30 into the second period. With the game still scoreless, Rinne snapped his glove to snag Jason Pominville's rising slap shot from the right circle.
Buffalo's minor-league call-up Linus Ullmark stopped 28 shots, starting in place of Robin Lehner, who was sidelined with an undisclosed injury.
Ullmark had little chance on Fisher's goal that opened the scoring 12:29 into the second period.
Fisher and teammate Scott Hartnell were both parked in front when Fisher deflected in Mikka Salomaki's shot from the blue line. The Sabres challenged the goal by arguing Fisher interfered with Ullmark. The goal was allowed to stand despite a replay showing Fisher nudged the back of Ullmark's skate in the crease and also got a hand on the goalie's glove.
Housley questioned the ruling.
""I don't know what you call goalie interference anymore,"" Housley said. ""His skate hits Linus' skate, which doesn't allow him to get down into the butterfly and make the save.""
There was no disputing Johansen's goal. Ullmark stopped Viktor Arvidsson's initial shot from the right circle. The rebound fell at Ullmark's his feet where Forsberg chipped the puck to Johansen, who snapped it in the open left side.
Game notes
 Brodeur leads the list of 40-game winners by having done so eight times. Washington's Braden Holtby is the only other active goalie to win 40 games three times. The other three-time 40-game-winners were Sawchuk, Jacques Plante, Mikka Kiprusoff and Evgeni Nabokov. ... Sabres RW Kyle Okposo returned after missing three games with a concussion. ... With 10 games left, the Predators inched closer to matching franchise records for most wins (51) and points (110) set in 2006-07.

Sabres: Host Arizona Coyotes on Wednesday in matchup of NHL's two worst teams.

Donato
(Bruins - C): Goals: 1, Assists: 2



Atkinson
(Blue Jackets - RW): Goals: 1, Assists: 0



Marchand
(Bruins - LW): Goals: 1, Assists: 1

BOSTON --  The Columbus Blue Jackets felt like they were lucky to get a victory in their late-season push for one of the Eastern Conference's playoff spots.
Cam Atkinson scored 2:55 into overtime to lift the Blue Jackets to a 5-4 comeback victory over Boston on Monday night for their eighth straight win, spoiling a splendid NHL debut for Bruins forward Ryan Donato.
""We stuck with it and that's what good teams do,"" Atkinson said. ""It wasn't our prettiest by no means, but we found a way to get two huge points.""
Sonny Milano, Boone Jenner, Thomas Vanek and Artemi Panarin also scored for the Blue Jackets. Nick Foligno and Ryan Murray had two assists, and Vanek and Jenner each added one. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 34 shots.
Columbus moved into a tie with Philadelphia with 85 points, but the Flyers hold the tiebreaker for third place in the Metropolitan Division and the Blue Jackets hold the first wild card in the East. New Jersey,which has the second wild card, is three points behind.
This one, though, may have been the Blue Jackets' ugliest during the current run.
""It just looked like as a whole group we didn't seem to have our legs,"" Columbus coach John Tortorella said. ""The turnovers hurt us, we turned the puck over quite a bit. But give them credit, they just ended up finding a way.""
Atkinson cut in on the left wing and fired a wrister past Tuukka Rask for the game-winner.
""You see it, there's no traffic in front of you, but there's more clear-cut chances,"" Rask said of the 3-on-3 overtime format. ""Even that goal there, it looks like he's going high-stick, but it goes under my hand.""
Donato had a goal and two assists for Boston, which moved a point behind idle Tampa Bay for first in the Atlantic. Riley Nash, Brad Marchand and David Krejci also scored for the Bruins, and Rask finished with 20 saves.
""It kind of felt like a dream,"" Donato said. ""I really didn't really get too warmed up because I was focused everything else.""
The Blue Jackets trailed by two late in the second period before scoring three consecutive goals to take a 4-3 lead.
Just 25 seconds after Nash had given the Bruins a 3-1 lead, Milano redirected Ryan Murray's slap-pass from the right point to pull Columbus within one with just over three minutes remaining in the middle period.
Vanek tipped in a shot from the slot, tying it 5:38 into the third, and Panarin put the Blue Jackets ahead off a faceoff with 8:30 left in regulation.
However, Donato slipped a short pass from the right circle to Krejci, who got the tying goal 20 seconds later while falling to one knee.
Jenner got Columbus on the scoreboard first when he redirected Vanek's pass by Rask 4:15 into the game.
The Bruins scored three straight goals in the second to take the lead. Marchand tied it with his team-leading 31st of the season when he got the puck at the end of a 2-on-1 break, shifted to his right and tucked it behind Korpisalo 5:41 into the middle period.
Donato, a Hobey Baker Finalist after leading Harvard in scoring this season, pushed Boston ahead with a one-timer that slipped inside the near post from the right faceoff circle at 7:28. The leading scorer on the U.S. team at the Pyeongchang Olympics signed a two-year, entry-level contract on Sunday.
Nash's power-play goal increased it to 3-1 as he banged home a rebound from the top of the crease with 3:28 remaining.
Game notes
 Boston F David Pastrnak got his 70th point on Marchand's goal, matching his career-high. ... Bruins F Rick Nash was a late scratch with an upper-body injury. ... The Blue Jackets entered with the league's second-worst power play and went 0 for 2 against the Bruins. ... Local Olympians, including eight from the women's Gold medal-winning hockey team, were honored during a ceremonial puck drop. ... Bruins captain Zdeno Chara missed his third straight with an upper-body injury. ... Columbus D Seth Jones missed his second straight with an upper-body injury.

Doughty
(Kings - D): Goals: 0, Assists: 3



Carter
(Kings - C): Goals: 2, Assists: 0



Staal
(Wild - C): Goals: 1, Assists: 0

ST. PAUL, Minn. --  Jeff Carter's return from ankle surgery has been a big boost for the playoff-hopeful Los Angeles Kings.
Carter scored his second goal of the game with 33.8 seconds left on the clock in overtime and Los Angeles recovered after giving up a two-goal lead to beat the Minnesota Wild 4-3 on Monday night.
""The puck just finds that guy,"" said defenseman Drew Doughty, who had three assists. ""It's unbelievable. It really is unbelievable. Two big goals again for us tonight. He's scored in almost every game he's been in, I feel like, since he got back. He's a goal scorer. He does it every single night, so he did a great job for us there once again.""
Tanner Pearson and Dustin Brown also scored for the Kings, who pulled into a tie with Anaheim for third place in the Pacific Division with 86 points -- and they hold the tiebreaker over the Ducks.
Jonathan Quick made 24 saves for Los Angeles, which appeared headed to a second straight loss until Brown tipped home a point shot from Doughty with 46.5 seconds left in regulation after Minnesota had taken a lead with 2:31 remaining.
""To come back, that's a huge two points for a team that we're quite honestly fighting with for position in the conference,"" Kings coach John Stevens said. ""It had its ebbs and flows for sure, but I thought the guys showed a lot of professionalism in terms of staying with it.""
Joel Eriksson Ek scored for the first time in 13 games to give the Wild a short-lived lead. Eric Staal added his 39th and Zach Parise had his second goal in three games for Minnesota.
Devan Dubnyk stopped 26 shots for the Wild, who are third in the Central Division, four points ahead of Colorado.
""They need points; so do we,"" Staal said. ""But when you have that lead with a minute left, you want to be able to execute and get that job done. Tonight, we didn't and they got the extra one in overtime.""
Pearson scored his 15th with 1:13 left in the first and Carter added his first of the game on the power play in the second. Carter has eight goals and two assists in 12 games since returning on Feb. 24 from surgery to repair a tendon in his ankle.
""I've been in the right place at the right time for a lot of my goals,"" Carter said.
Parise started Minnesota's comeback with his ninth of the season and Staal tied the game with 56 seconds remaining in the second. Staal has 13 goals in the past 14 games.
""Every point you get right now is great,"" Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. ""To get into the next category, the 90 points, is really big. Again, we had the lead with a minute to go and then we didn't do the right things in the overtime.""
Game notes
 Los Angeles F Trevor Lewis left the game with an upper body injury and did not return. ... Kings D Derek Forbort left the game in the first after he was cut near his ear by Zach Parise's skate but did return in the second. ... Per the Elias Sports Bureau, Staal could join Gordie Howe as the only players in NHL history with at least nine seasons between 40-goal campaigns. Staal has his most since scoring 40 in 2008-09. ... Los Angeles C Alex Iafallo was scratched for the first time since Jan. 4, a span of 32 games. Andy Andreoff was in the lineup after being scratched 11 games in a row. ... Minnesota got three assists from its defensemen. Wild defenseman have now accounted for 36 goals and 142 assists this season. Their 178 points from the blue line is second only to Nashville's 181 this season.

Kings: At Winnipeg on Tuesday night.

599,"
By the end of this week, nearly all of the nation's top programs will be well underway with spring football, as powerhouses such as Alabama, Georgia, Michigan and Florida State all get going this week.
It has been -- and will continue to be -- a wild offseason of coaching debuts, quarterback battles and intriguing freshman. Here's a look at the most important players, coaches and questions for each conference this spring.
Players to watch:
Jawon Pass, QB, Louisville: The rising sophomore from Columbus, Georgia, is the leading contender to replace 2016 Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson.
Kenny Pickett, QB, Pittsburgh: His performance in a season-ending upset of No. 2 Miami -- 253 total yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions -- gave the Panthers hope for the future. He goes into spring practice as the No. 1 quarterback.
Chazz Surratt, QB, North Carolina: Surratt showed promise as a freshman but was benched late in the season. He'll have to hold off Nathan Elliott this spring; Larry Fedora needs one of them to improve dramatically.
Coaches to watch:
Willie Taggart, head coach, Florida State: The former South Florida and Oregon coach will try to turn around the Seminoles, who slipped badly in Jimbo Fisher's final season.
Brian VanGorder, defensive coordinator, Louisville: The well-traveled defensive coordinator takes over at Louisville. He's the Cardinals' third defensive coordinator in as many seasons. Nobody said working for Bobby Petrino was easy.
Nate Woody, defensive coordinator, Georgia Tech: The former Appalachian State defensive coordinator takes over a Tech unit that gave up 26.5 points per game and forced only 10 turnovers, fewest in the ACC in 2017.
Newcomers to watch:
Damon Hazelton, WR, Virginia Tech: The Ball State transfer sat out last season under NCAA rules after hauling in 51 catches for 505 yards with four touchdowns for the Cardinals as a freshman.
Derion Kendrick, WR, Clemson: Kendrick, the No. 6 athlete in the ESPN 300, enrolled early and might have a chance to crack Clemson's receiver corps. The Tigers are seeking replacements for Deon Cain and Ray-Ray McCloud.
Bryce Perkins, QB, Virginia: The former Arizona State quarterback, who last season played at Arizona Western College, goes into the spring as perhaps the man to beat. He's the younger brother of former UCLA tailback Paul Perkins.
Biggest spring questions:
1. Can anyone challenge Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant?
Bryant, a rising senior, threw for 2,802 yards with 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 2017, helping the Tigers reach the College Football Playoff. Bryant will probably leave spring practice atop the depth chart, but it will be interesting to see how much sophomore Hunter Johnson and early enrollee Trevor Lawrence will push him in the spring and summer.
Lawrence, the No. 2 prospect in the 2018 ESPN 300, is 6-foot-6 and has a very accurate arm, but he still has a lot to learn.
2. Will Miami quarterback Malik Rosier keep his job?
Like Bryant, Rosier was pretty successful in his first season as a starter, throwing for 3,120 yards with 26 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. Miami won 10 games and played in the ACC championship game for the first time.
But Rosier also struggled with accuracy at times, completing only 44.9 percent of his passes in the final three games -- consecutive losses to Pittsburgh, Clemson and Wisconsin, in the Capital One Orange Bowl. Miami coach Mark Richt has gone out of his way to say Rosier is still the starter, and given Richt's history, it seems unlikely he'd bench a fifth-year senior. But redshirt freshman N'Kosi Perry was one of the top dual-threat quarterbacks in the country in high school, and early enrollee Jarren Williams was the No. 6 dual-threat quarterback in the 2018 ESPN 300.
3. Can Taggart rebuild FSU's defense?
Taggart and defensive coordinator Harlon Barnett have plenty of work to do on defense this spring. The Seminoles lost three starting linebackers and both safeties, including All-American Derwin James.
Juniors Josh Brown, Dontavious Jackson, Emmett Rice, sophomore Leonard Warner and Alabama transfer Adonis Thomas are in line to take over at linebacker. Senior A.J. Westbrook is the top candidate to replace James in the secondary.
Players to watch:
Will Grier, QB, West Virginia: He missed the final two games of the 2017 season because of a finger injury, and he goes into 2018 as perhaps the Big 12's biggest star. If Grier stays healthy, and West Virginia's defense improves, the Mountaineers might be Big 12 title contenders.
Kyle Kempt, QB, Iowa State: The former walk-on was granted a rare sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA -- and he was given a scholarship by the Cyclones. If he continues to develop as a passer, Iowa State might be more than a one-year wonder.
Shawn Robinson, QB, TCU: The dual-threat quarterback started one game as a freshman -- throwing for 85 yards and running for 84 in a 27-3 win at Texas Tech -- and now he's in line to replace Kenny Hill as the starter if he can hold off early enrollee Justin Rogers and Penn transfer Michael Collins.
Coaches to watch:
Kliff Kingsbury, head coach, Texas Tech: Kingsbury saved his job with late-season victories over Baylor and Texas. He'll have to replace quarterback Nic Shimonek, although 10 starters are back from a vastly improved defense.
Jim Knowles, defensive coordinator, Oklahoma State: The 30-year coaching veteran, who most recently did fantastic work at Duke, takes over an OSU defense that ranked 85th in scoring defense (29.4 points) and 79th in total defense (409.3 yards) last season.
Bill Snyder, head coach, Kansas State: The 78-year-old Hall of Fame coach has endured treatments for throat cancer and the sudden death of one of his grandsons over the past two years. Will his 27th season at KSU be his last one?
Newcomers to watch:
Jake Fruhmorgen, OT, Baylor: The former Clemson starter, who sat out last season under NCAA rules, should help a Baylor offensive line that gave up a whopping 38 sacks last season.
Brendan Radley-Hiles, DB, Oklahoma: The four-star prospect from IMG Academy has already created buzz in spring practice because of his versatility. He could bring much-needed athleticism to an OU secondary that greatly needs an upgrade.
T.J. Simmons, WR, West Virginia: The former four-star recruit played special teams at Alabama before transferring after the 2016 season. He'll give Grier another pass-catching option.
Biggest spring questions:
1. Can Oklahoma replace Baker Mayfield?
It was widely assumed that Kyler Murray, who was Mayfield's backup last season, would be the reigning Heisman Trophy winner's replacement in 2018, and that still might be the case.
But will Murray's decision to split his time this spring between football practice and baseball -- he's the Sooners' starting center fielder -- give OU coach Lincoln Riley pause? Murray, who attempted 21 passes in 2017, isn't expected to miss any football practice this spring. But sophomore Austin Kendall might have more opportunities to show his abilities.
2. Will Texas coach Tom Herman choose a quarterback?
Herman couldn't pick a starting quarterback in his first season at Texas, as Shane Buechele and Sam Ehlinger each started at least six games during a 7-6 campaign in 2017. Neither was terrific, but that might have had more to do with their nagging injuries and the Longhorns' inability to block and run the ball consistently.
It figures to be a heated quarterback competition in Austin through the offseason, and Herman might take a more hands-on approach in the play calling to get things going. Ehlinger's running ability might make him a better fit for Herman's style; Buechele has shown flashes of production, especially during his freshman season in 2016, when he threw for 2,958 yards.
3. Who replaces Mason Rudolph at Oklahoma State?
Rudolph threw for 4,904 passing yards -- more than any FBS quarterback in 2017 -- and leaves a gaping hole in OSU's offense. The two scholarship quarterbacks on campus, former walk-on Taylor Cornelius and sophomore Keondre Wudtee, combined to throw 13 passes in mop-up duty last season.
They'll compete for the job this spring, but Hawaii graduate transfer Dru Brown and incoming freshman Spencer Sanders will join the competition this summer. A two-year starter at Hawaii, Brown passed for 2,785 yards with 18 touchdowns in 2017. Sanders was the top-rated high school quarterback in Texas in 2017, with 5,225 yards of offense and 70 touchdowns at Ryan High School in Denton.
Players to watch
Brian Lewerke, QB, Michigan State: Last season, he became the first Spartans quarterback to throw for more than 2,500 yards and rush for more than 500 yards in the same season. If he's as good in 2018, the Spartans might be a Big Ten title contender.
Jeffrey Okudah, CB, Ohio State: The No. 1 cornerback and No. 7 overall player in the 2017 ESPN 300, Okudah is in line to replace starting cornerback Denzel Ward, who left early for the NFL. Okudah and safety Isaiah Pryor might be OSU's next stars in the secondary.
Miles Sanders, RB, Penn State: The Pittsburgh native averaged 7.4 yards per carry as a freshman and 6.2 yards as a sophomore. Now, he has the unenviable task of replacing record-setting PSU tailback Saquon Barkley.
Coaches to watch
Scott Frost, head coach, Nebraska: There might not be more excitement about any FBS first-year coach. After guiding UCF to a perfect season, Frost returns to Nebraska to try to revive his alma mater. Tickets for the April 21 spring game sold out in one day.
Jim McElwain, wide receivers coach, Michigan: The former Florida head coach landed on his feet at Michigan, where he might end up taking over the playcalling. Michigan threw nine touchdown passes in 2017, its fewest since 1975, when it attempted only 125 passes while running the triple option under Bo Schembechler.
Ricky Rahne, offensive coordinator, Penn State: Rahne takes over the playcalling from former OC Joe Moorhead, who left to become Mississippi State's head coach. PSU fans got a sneak peak of Rahne's offense in a 35-28 victory over Washington in the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl, in which the Nittany Lions piled up 25 first downs and 545 yards of offense.
Newcomers to watch:
Adrian Martinez, QB, Nebraska: The four-star recruit from Fresno, California, will have a chance to win the starting job in Frost's first season. He'll battle Patrick O'Brien and Tristan Gebbia for it.
Micah Parsons, LB, Penn State: Parsons, the No. 7 overall player in the ESPN 300, turned heads in the weight room this offseason. He'll probably line up at inside linebacker, and he's wearing LaVar Arrington's famous No. 11 jersey.
Vic Viramontes, QB, Minnesota: Viramontes, the No. 1-ranked juco passer in the country, might be the guy to beat in the Gophers' quarterback competition. He passed for 1,868 yards and ran for 1,346 with 43 total touchdowns at Riverside (California) Community College last season.
Biggest spring questions
1. Will Michigan rebound in Jim Harbaugh's fourth season?
Michigan's inexperience was probably a big reason for its 8-5 slide in 2017, but the Wolverines also need better quarterback play. They're still waiting to find out whether Ole Miss transfer Shea Patterson will be eligible to play this season. If the NCAA awards him a waiver, Michigan might be ready to contend for a Big Ten title.
If Patterson can't play, Harbaugh will have to choose between sophomore Brandon Peters, who started in the Wolverines' 26-19 loss to South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, or redshirt freshman Dylan McCaffrey. Former starter Wilton Speight, who missed most of last season because of cracked vertebrae in his neck, announced in November that he planned to join another team as a graduate transfer. Might Speight be willing to return if Patterson is ruled ineligible for 2018?
2. Who replaces J.T. Barrett at Ohio State?
Ohio State's quarterback situation doesn't seem quite as unsettled as Michigan's. Sophomore Dwayne Haskins looked good as Barrett's backup last season, completing 70.2 percent of his passes with four touchdowns and one interception, and he'll be forever remembered for coming off the bench and guiding the Buckeyes to a 31-20 win over Michigan (after Barrett injured his knee when bumping into a camera on the sideline during pregame warm-ups).
Redshirt junior Joe Burrow, who broke his hand in August, is getting a fair chance to beat out Haskins this spring. Another potential factor: Burrow is scheduled to graduate from Ohio State this spring, so if he doesn't like where he stands in the competition at the end of spring practice, he could transfer and retain his eligibility at another school this coming season. Redshirt freshman Tate Martell is also in the mix.
3. How does Wisconsin rebuild it defense?
With tailback Jonathan Taylor and quarterback Alex Hornibrook returning, Wisconsin has more than enough firepower on offense to contend for its third straight Big Ten West title.
But the Badgers will need a makeover on defense, especially in the secondary, where three starters have departed. Safety D'Cota Dixon is coming back, and Patrick Johnson is the top candidate to start at the other safety spot. Sophomores Dontye Carriere-Williams and Madison Cone are the top contenders to start at cornerback.
Up front, early enrollee Bryson Williams, who spurned hometown Nebraska to sign with the Badgers, might get an early look on the defensive line.
Players to watch
Myles Gaskin, RB, Washington: The star tailback announced he was returning for his senior season after receiving a fourth-round grade from the NFL Draft Advisory Board. He'll enter 2018 needing only 52 yards to break Napoleon Kaufman's school career rushing record of 4,106 yards.
Justin Herbert, QB, Oregon: If Herbert can stay healthy -- he missed five games as a sophomore because of a shoulder injury -- he might be a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender. He threw for 1,983 yards with 15 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2017, and the Ducks went 6-2 with him in the lineup.
Khalil Tate, QB, Arizona: Tate passed for 1,591 yards with 14 touchdowns and ran for 1,411 yards with 12 scores while starting nine games last season. He might be even more prolific under new Wildcats coach Kevin Sumlin, who had great success with Johnny Manziel at Texas A&M.
Coaches to watch
Mario Cristobal, head coach, Oregon: Oregon players lobbied university brass to promote Cristobal after Willie Taggart left for FSU. They responded by losing to Boise State 38-28 in the Las Vegas Bowl.
Herm Edwards, head coach, Arizona State: There might not be a more scrutinized first-year FBS coach, err CEO, than Edwards, a former NFL head coach and ESPN analyst who hasn't coached in college football since he was San Jose State's defensive backs coach in 1989.
Kevin Sumlin, head coach, Arizona: Sumlin could have sat back and enjoyed his $12.4 million buyout from Texas A&M. But he was hired at Arizona, which unexpectedly fired Rich Rodriguez on Jan. 3 in wake of a sexual harassment allegation.
Newcomers to watch
Cammon Cooper, QB, Washington State: The early enrollee set Utah high school single-season records for passing yards (4,726), completions (331) and touchdown passes (58) and might be thrust into the starting role.
Talanoa Hufanga, ATH, USC: The versatile athlete from Corvallis, Oregon, enrolled at USC early and might play a plethora of positions this spring. While he could get immediate playing time on offense and special teams, he'll also get a look at strong safety this spring.
Jack Tuttle, QB, Utah: The three-star recruit from San Marcos, California, is already on campus and competing in spring practice. Utes coach Kyle Whittingham has compared his maturity to a 28-year-old veteran.
Biggest spring questions:
1. What will Stanford's offense look like?
Former Cardinal offensive coordinator Mike Bloomgren left to become Rice's head coach, and David Shaw tabbed former Stanford quarterback Tavita Pritchard to replace him. We'll start to find out how many changes Pritchard intends to make, but one thing is for sure: There will still be a heavy dose of Heisman Trophy contender Bryce Love, who unexpectedly returned for his senior season.
Stanford fans might have to wait until preseason camp to get a good look at Pritchard's offense. Quarterback K.J. Costello will miss the spring because of a hip injury, backup Davis Mills is out because of a knee injury, and former starter Keller Chryst transferred to Tennessee. The only quarterback available for spring practice is walk-on Jack Richardson.
2. What will Chip Kelly do at UCLA?
The former Philadelphia Eagles coach has returned to college football, and the rest of the Pac-12 is anxious to find out if his offense will be as potent as it was at Oregon. Will it look the same, or will there be new wrinkles? Unfortunately for Kelly, Bruins quarterback Josh Rosen left for the NFL. Last year's backup, Devon Modster, is more of a drop-back passer, so Washington graduate transfer K.J. Carta-Samuels (who is expected to arrive later this month) or incoming freshman Dorian Thompson-Robinson, who doesn't arrive until this summer, might be better equipped to run Kelly's high-flying spread offense.
3. Who's replacing Sam Darnold at USC?
Highly regarded incoming freshman J.T. Daniels, the Gatorade National Player of the Year, is graduating a year early from high school and will enroll at USC this summer. He threw for 12,014 yards, 152 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in three seasons at Mater Dei High in Santa Ana, California, which is where former Trojans stars Matt Barkley and Matt Leinart played.
It's hard to imagine Trojans coach Clay Helton throwing Daniels into the fire as a freshman, but Daniels probably didn't reclassify so he'd have to sit on the bench in 2018. Unless Matt Fink or Jack Sears blows Helton's socks off this spring, Daniels figures to have a chance to compete for the job in preseason camp.
Players to watch
Jerry Jeudy, WR, Alabama: Departed star Calvin Ridley was the only Alabama receiver who caught more than 15 passes last season. Jeudy averaged 18.9 yards per catch, and he and CFP National Championship Game hero DeVonta Smith will have to play bigger roles in 2018.
Kam Martin, RB, Auburn: Martin had limited action playing behind star Kerryon Johnson and Kamryn Pettway in 2017, running for 453 yards with two touchdowns. The former Baylor signee will have to carry a bigger load after Johnson and Pettway left for the NFL draft.
D'Andre Swift, RB, Georgia: As a freshman, Swift ran for 618 yards with three touchdowns in limited action behind stars Nick Chubb and Sony Michel last season. With Chubb and Michel departing, he becomes Georgia's bell-cow back this coming season.
Coaches to watch
Steve Ensminger, offensive coordinator, LSU: Ensminger was a surprising choice to replace former LSU offensive coordinator Matt Canada, who was dumped after only one season. If Ensminger doesn't figure out a way to turn around LSU's offense, Tigers coach Ed Orgeron might be in trouble.
Chad Morris, head coach, Arkansas: The former SMU head coach will begin installing the fast-paced, spread offense that earned him a sterling reputation as Clemson's offensive coordinator. He might want to spend a little time fixing the Hogs' defense, too.
Jeremy Pruitt, head coach, Tennessee: The former Alabama defensive coordinator faces an uphill climb at Tennessee, which floundered under former coach Butch Jones. The good news: There's nowhere to go but up. The Vols went 4-8, 0-8 in the SEC last season, the first eight-loss season in school history.

Justin Fields, QB, Georgia: The No. 1 overall player in the ESPN 300, Fields enrolled early and will compete with returning starter Jake Fromm this spring. Fromm threw for 2,615 yards with 24 touchdowns as a freshman, leading Georgia to a 13-2 record, SEC title and its first appearance in the CFP.
Jonathan Giles, WR, LSU: Giles finished fourth in the Big 12 in receiving as a sophomore at Texas Tech in 2016, hauling in 69 catches for 1,158 yards with 13 touchdowns. The Tigers have to replace four of their top five receivers from last season.
Saivion Smith, CB, Alabama: The former LSU player, who spent last season at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, got a head start by enrolling early and practicing with the Tide before the Allstate Sugar Bowl. He's one of the top candidates to start in the secondary, where Alabama must replace every starter.
Biggest spring questions
1. Who will win Alabama's quarterback job? 
Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban faces a difficult decision in choosing between incumbent Jalen Hurts, who is 27-2 as the Tide's starting quarterback, or sophomore Tua Tagovailoa, who came off the bench to lead Alabama to a 26-23 overtime victory over Georgia in the CFP National Championship. Saban told ESPN's Chris Low last week that he isn't against using a two-quarterback system this coming season. New offensive coordinator Mike Locksley and quarterbacks coach/associate head coach Dan Enos will have a lot to evaluate this spring.
2. How much of an impact will Texas A&M's $75 million coach have? 
Texas A&M lured Jimbo Fisher away from Florida State with one of the richest contracts in college football history, and the Aggies probably don't want to wait very long for a return on their sizable investment. The Aggies lost only six starters from last season, including star receiver Christian Kirk and safety Armani Watts. One of Fisher's biggest priorities is deciding on a quarterback; he's one of the better quarterback coaches in the country. The Aggies have been unsettled there since Johnny Manziel left in 2013. Nick Starkel and Kellen Mond both started at times last season.
3. Is Georgia here to stay? 
The Bulldogs won their first SEC title since 2005 in coach Kirby Smart's second season. They'll have to replace much of their defense, which ranked No. 6 in FBS in both scoring defense (16.4 points) and total defense (294.9 yards). Along with replacing star linebackers Davin Bellamy, Lorenzo Carter and Roquan Smith, Georgia also lost defensive tackle Trenton Thompson, nose tackle John Atkins, cornerbacks Malkom Parrish and Aaron Davis and safety Dominick Sanders. Young players such as safety Richard LeCounte III, linebackers Walter Grant and Monty Rice and nose tackle Julian Rochester will have to become bigger contributors.
Players to watch
1. Tommy Kraemer, G, Notre Dame
The 2015 Gatorade Player of the Year in Ohio is among the candidates to take on a starting role on Notre Dame's offensive line, which must replace All-Americans Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey. Kraemer is versatile enough to play either guard or tackle.
2. A.J. Richardson, WR, Boise State
Richardson had a pretty good junior season with 33 catches for 494 yards with two touchdowns in 2017. But he'll have to be even more productive with star receiver Cedrick Wilson (1,511 receiving yards) and tight end Jake Roh (nine touchdown catches) departing.
3. Chris Robison, QB, FAU
The Oklahoma transfer is in line to replace former starter Jason Driskel, who retired from football to become an engineer. Robison will battle FSU transfer De'Andre Johnson, who missed most of last season because of blood clots in his arm, for the job this spring. If Robison wins the job, he'll face his former team when the Owls open the season at Oklahoma on Sept. 1.
Coaches to watch
1. Sonny Dykes, head coach, SMU: The former Cal coach was hired to replace Chad Morris at SMU, and he coached the Mustangs in a bowl game only nine days later. The result was predictable: Louisiana Tech blasted SMU 51-10 in the DXL Frisco Bowl. Morris was slowly bringing the Mustangs back, and Dykes should benefit from a replenished roster.
2. Clark Lea, defensive coordinator, Notre Dame: Lea was hired as Notre Dame's linebackers coach before the 2017 season and was promoted to defensive coordinator after Mike Elko left for Texas A&M. After dramatic improvement last season, the Fighting Irish probably won't make many changes in their scheme.
3. Kalani Sitake, head coach, BYU: The Cougars slipped to 4-9 last season, and they're 13-13 in Sitake's two seasons. BYU needs to find an identity on offense -- legendary quarterback Ty Detmer was fired as the team's offensive coordinator in November -- and there won't be much time for growing pains this coming season. BYU plays three of its first five games on the road: at Arizona, at Wisconsin and at Washington.
Newcomers to watch
1. Jovon Durante, WR, FAU: Durante caught 59 passes for 709 yards with seven touchdowns in two seasons at West Virginia before he was dismissed from the team. He transferred to FAU and sat out last season. The Owls need him to emerge as a big-play weapon after losing Kalib Woods and Kamrin Solomon.
2. Brady White, QB, Memphis: The Arizona State graduate transfer will battle David Moore, Brady Davis and others for the starting job this spring. The Tigers are replacing Riley Ferguson, who became the first Memphis quarterback to throw for more than 4,000 yards in a season in 2017.
3. Zach Wilson, QB, BYU: Wilson, the runner-up for Mr. Football in Utah, enrolled early and is getting a chance to compete for the starting job this spring. Incumbent Tanner Mangum is still recovering from an Achilles injury, and Beau Hoge has been plagued by concussions in the past.
Biggest spring questions
1. Can Josh Heupel keep UCF's momentum going? 
Yes, the Knights are taking a break from their ""national championship"" celebration to conduct spring practices. Heupel, a former offensive coordinator at Oklahoma and Missouri, takes over for Scott Frost, who took every UCF assistant with him to Nebraska. At least Frost left behind quarterback McKenzie Milton and 13 other starters. The Knights will have to replace top pass catchers Tre'Quan Smith and Jordan Akins, as well as star linebacker Shaquem Griffin and cornerback Mike Hughes on defense.
2. Who's going to replace Quinton Flowers at USF? 
USF coach Charlie Strong has to replace Flowers, who was one of the most productive players in the FBS last season, passing for 2,911 yards with 25 touchdowns and running for 1,078 yards with 11 scores. Flowers guided USF to back-to-back seasons with at least 10 wins; the Bulls had never won more than nine games in a season before 2016. Junior Brett Kean, who attempted 11 passes last season, is battling sophomore Chris Oladokun (one pass attempt in 2017) for the unenviable job of replacing Flowers.
3. Can Houston's Ed Oliver contend for the Heisman? 
Oliver is probably the best player in the country, regardless of position, and he already has announced that this coming season will be his last at Houston. He's expected to be a top-five pick in the 2019 NFL draft, and it's never too early for the Cougars to start touting him as a Heisman Trophy candidate. Oliver, who won the Outland Trophy as the sport's top interior lineman last season, has 39.5 tackles for loss in two seasons.

Waltrip retired from full-time racing after the 2009 NASCAR season but has continued to compete as a part-time driver. His relationship with Aaron's represents one of the longest-running corporate partnerships in the racing industry.
""I can reflect on my career with a lot of emotions and one company that has been there for me is Aaron's,"" said Waltrip.  ""I started working with Aaron's almost 20 years ago with some commercials and six Xfinity Series races when I had a team behind my house.  We have been together ever since and it makes my heart smile thinking about all the great things we did together.""
Next week Aaron's plans to debut a video showing the first of Waltrip's ""Top Five Aaron's & Waltrip Racing Moments"" selected from the past 17 years as partners.

Sorenson driving for Premium Motorsports at Daytona: Reed Sorenson will return to Premium Motorsports in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, fielding the second car for the two-car operation during the Daytona 500. In the midst of a busy offseason that saw the organization move its race shop to Mooresville, North Carolina, team owner Jay Robinson confirmed to Frontstretch that Sorenson will pilot the #55 car beginning with the season-opening Daytona 500 next month, with more races possible, dependent on sponsorship. During the 2016 season, Sorenson competed in 28 races for Premium Motorsports in the Cup Series, with a best finish of 22nd at Daytona International Speedway in early July. Though Sorenson will be competing in the #55 car, it is the #15 car that has a guaranteed starting position into all 36 races after Premium Motorsports' purchase of the charter from HScott Motorsports, which shut down over the off-season. The organization decided to keep the number 15, getting rid of the #98, which attempted to qualify for 33 races in 2016, 29 with Cole Whitt. Lee Leslie will sit atop the pit box of the #55 car. Having no ties with any manufacture, the team will run Toyotas at the four superspeedway races in 2017, moving to Chevrolet in the other 32 events. Robinson was hesitant in naming a full-time driver for the #15 car, but revealed he has found a driver for Daytona that will be released at a later date.(Frontstretch)(1-23-2017)
Michael Waltrip says he will run 2017 Daytona 500 UPDATE: two-time Daytona 500 winner Michael Waltrip was asked if he would be racing in the Daytona 500 this year (2017) and tweeted back: ""Yes!  In the @AaronsInc @ToyotaRacing #Camry"".

UPDATE: looks like Waltrip will run the Daytona 500 for Premium Motorsports, probably in the #55 Toyota.  Images of the chassis were posted at Spraker Racing's Facebook page along with ""Just finished rule updates and had NASCAR recertification done for Premium Motorsports Monster Energy Cup car driven by Michael Waltrip"".

Jeffrey Earnhardt and StarCom Racing have parted ways after a frustrating start to the 2018 season.
Earnhardt, the 28-year-old grandson of Dale Earnhardt and nephew of Dale Earnhardt Jr., was 33rd in the NASCAR Cup Series standings five races into the season.
After a promising career-best 21st-place finish in the Daytona 500, Earnhardt posted finishes of 34th, 31st, 35th and 36th in the next four races. He is the lowest in points of any driver who has run all five races, and the team is 36th in the owner standings.
We want to thank @JEarnhardt1 for his time with SCR, we have mutually agreed to move in different directions at this time. It was a pleasure working together & we wish success to Jeffrey & his team. Stay tuned this week for more information on who will be at the wheel of the 00!
— StarCom Racing (@StarcomRacing) March 19, 2018
""I want to thank StarCom Racing for the opportunity to pilot the No. 00 Chevrolet,"" Earnhardt said. ""We are working hard on our sponsorship package and long-term plans, which unfortunately means taking a pause behind the wheel to take care of that business.
""I can't thank Robert Stanners and the VRX Simulators group enough for getting our season started, and continuing to support my racing career. We anticipate that there will be some exciting news to be shared within coming weeks.""
Earnhardt and the team, which is run by former driver Derrike Cope, had hoped they could grow together. The team fielded a car for Cope in two races last year and leased a charter from Richard Childress Racing for the 2018 season. Earnhardt, the son of Dale Earnhardt's eldest son, Kerry, lost his ride in December when his team co-owners Joe Falk and Curtis Key ended their partnership.
Earnhardt has 83 career NASCAR Cup starts.

602,"
FONTANA, Calif. -- The 2018 Martin Truex Jr. didn't look like the 2017 Martin Truex Jr. for the first four races of the season.
He had relinquished the throne as the most dominant driver to Kevin Harvick, who won back-to-back-to-back races following the season-opening Daytona 500.
Truex could see him in those races, he just couldn't catch him.
The Furniture Row Racing driver didn't have to catch Harvick on Sunday, as he started on the pole, was ahead of the Harvick crash on Lap 38 and used a strong, long-run car to lead 125 of the 200 laps to capture the Auto Club 400.
Truex's margin of victory -- 11.685 seconds -- was the largest since 2009, as the final 68 laps went green at Auto Club Speedway.
Editor's PicksTruex Jr. wins Fontana for 1st victory of seasonMartin Truex Jr. has cruised to victory at Fontana, claiming the first win of the season for last year's NASCAR Cup Series champion. Defending-race-champ Kyle Larson finished second.
Martin Truex Jr. has cruised to victory at Fontana, claiming the first win of the season for last year's NASCAR Cup Series champion. Defending-race-champ Kyle Larson finished second.
""I don't really worry about who's winning, who else is fast,"" Truex said. ""Obviously, the 4 [of Harvick] has been quick. They've got a great team. Kevin is an awesome driver. They had it going on the last couple weeks.
""As we seen today, we can put together a run like that, as well. I think most of all it feels good, we're able to find that speed we've been looking for the last couple weeks. Like I said, we've been close, but not quite close enough. We knew we were off a bit, so it wasn't a surprise that we weren't winning.""
Harvick's wreck came when trying to side-draft Kyle Larson batting for third on Lap 38. Yes, Lap 38.
After he got out of the car, Harvick admitted he tried for too much too soon. He had the best long-run car in practice Saturday but started 10th and just got impatient with 22 laps left in the stage.
""That's my fault for coming down the race track right there and trying to side-draft, and then as we touch it, just came back up the race track,"" he said. ""I was just trying to get a little too much right there.""
Harvick made the mistake thinking about potential points for winning a stage. With each stage win, a driver earns a playoff point that can carry through the first three rounds of the postseason and can mean the difference when it comes to advancing.
But with the accident and 35th-place finish resulting in Harvick's falling from first to eighth in the standings -- Truex out-pointed him 60-2 on the day -- he potentially cost himself the regular-season title. Drivers in the top 10 in the regular-season standings earn points on a 15-10-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 scale.
""I wasn't surprised that we were racing that hard, or he was racing me as hard as he was to try to hold me off,"" Larson said. ""He had pitted a lap before me. ... He was just trying to hold me off, race me hard to maybe burn my stuff up, then he could stay in front of me, not have to worry about me 10, 15 laps later, when he would be better than me.
""I was actually having a lot of fun racing like that because this place is really cool, you can just kind of go wherever.""
Larson admitted he was frustrated when it first happened.
""I was pretty amped up on the radio there right after just because I felt like at the time maybe he let his frustration build and kind of just ran into me down the backstretch, wrecked himself,"" Larson said. ""I thought he would be mad at me or something like that, which I knew I didn't do anything wrong at the time.
""A couple minutes later, they let me know he was taking the blame for it on the radio, which was nice. I was able to chill out some.""
Larson rebounded from that accident but couldn't overcome everything thrown at him Sunday. Truex won by avoiding mistakes and bad luck that plagued the three drivers who theoretically could have competed with him Sunday.
Kyle Busch might not have had anything for Truex on the long run, but his fate was sealed when his team accidentally loosened the car up on a pit stop with an adjustment instead of tightening the car. He finished third behind Truex and Larson.
""We weren't going to have anything for the 78 [of Truex] regardless, I don't think,"" Busch's crew chief Adam Stevens said. ""Could we have stayed ahead of the 42 [of Larson]? Probably. I just don't think we had anything for the 78 today.
""[That mistake] happens a couple of times a year. It happened twice last year. It just happens. ... It was just one of them things. It had no bearing on us winning the race. Did it have a bearing on second to third? Probably. But who gives a crap at that point?""
Larson didn't feel the wreck ruined his day, as he drove through the field a couple of times, including once from a self-inflicted loose wheel following a pit stop. He also had a strange part break -- the outer half of a bridge duct on the right front-brake caliper came off and got stuck between the wheel and the hub on a pit stop.
Crew chief Chad Johnston said it was either a part failure or the team damaged it when changing tires.
Truex -- who had finishes of fifth, fourth and fifth in the three races Harvick won -- had no such issues. That wasn't always the case last year, when various issues kept him from winning double-digit races and ""settling"" for eight victories and the title.
If his team can continue to improve, well, y'all saw how 2017 went.
""After the beginning of the season there, watching Harvick run away with everything, I wasn't sure where we were at,"" Furniture Row Racing owner Barney Visser said. ""I wish he would have not had the problems he had today and we could have run him again.
""We had something for him today. We won't know for a few weeks here where we're at.""
Last year, Truex virtually guaranteed himself a spot in the championship round, earning 53 playoff points in the regular season and 16 more in the first six playoff races.
""Winning the regular season for us last year, it's a big confidence-booster,"" Truex said. ""Honestly, it means a lot to a team. It's so difficult to do, to win. ... It's a huge accomplishment to win the regular-season points. It's so difficult to come to all these different race tracks, be consistent week after week, deal with all the things that racing can throw at you.
""It's something that, absolutely, we're looking forward to doing that. Like I said, we've got the consistency so far, which has been really good. Hopefully, we can continue that.""
Harvick never got a chance to race him. Why race so hard so early?
""It's a race,"" he said.
Maybe winning four in a row is too much for anyone to ask.
""It's not too much to ask,"" Harvick said. ""That was just a dumb mistake on my part, so it wasn't too much to ask. The race car was there. It was just a mistake.""

Neymar's spell at PSG, which began in August, has been a rocky and interesting one. There's been some highs that include dashing performances and a couple more lows than most probably expected. The latest reported development from Neymar's stint in Paris is a massive pay raise request.
According to The London Times, Neymar wants $1.39 million per week ($72.28M yearly wage) to stay at PSG after meeting with club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi in Brazil, where the player is recovering from foot surgery that is expected to keep him out until May. 
It's just one event in a long line of them since the Brazilian departed Barcelona for France.  Here's all that has happened since he arrived and what this means for both the player and the club:
Neymar has seemed to clash a bit with PSG star striker Edinson Cavani when it comes to the penalty kick and free-kick duties. It caused a bit of tension in the squad and really it seems like more of a headache than anything else, nothing any manager would want to deal it.
Take a look at the early season issue:
The biggest bit of news was Neymar's injury, which occurred in late February against Marseille. The player ended up having surgery to fix a fracture in his pinkie toe, and it even raised concerns as to whether he would be fit for this summer's World Cup in Russia. 
It was a huge blow to PSG's season when it came to the hope of conquering Europe. See below. 
PSG was returning home to face Real Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League round of 16 tie set for early March, and that's when he got hurt against Marseille and missed out on the second leg. Without him, PSG couldn't overcome the 3-1 deficit from the first leg and was eliminated from the competition in a year where it looked like as good of a contender as any team in the tournament. 
On top of this, there's the financial demands with reported interested from Real Madrid. And it feels like something PSG will have to put up with if they want to keep him. It isn't ideal having your highest-paid player demand more money, but it's something that isn't uncommon in the sport throughout the world, especially Europe.
Neymar's move to PSG for $273 million comes without a release clause, according to a lawyer who represented the deal, per AS. And his contract is believed to be in the region of $45 million per season.
So without a release clause, if he were to leave, it would have to be on a free transfer with an expired contract or an agreed upon transfer fee between PSG and another club.
In the end, we'll have to see if this move is ever worth it for the Parisian club. There have been a few headaches, but the production has been there. He has 28 goals in 30 games for the club and has looked every part of one the world's best players. 
If he does end up moving to Real Madrid for a much higher price than they paid, then it would be some good business. But for all the drama, and reported demands, if Neymar doesn't guide PSG to Champions League glory, it will feel like a move that was never really worth it in the end.

On the same day we saw teammates fight each other in France, we've got another crazy scene, this time between two coaches in Mexico. Former Mexico national team manager Miguel Herrera, now with America, and Toluca manager Hernan Cristante got into a heated exchange near the middle of the field during Saturday's Liga MX game. The tensions between the two rose to the point that Cristante grabbed Herrera by the neck. Take a look: 
Mientras tanto en la Liga MXHerrera vs Cristante 😱 pic.twitter.com/7BWwQK9s6C
Talk about losing your cool. And the words that followed weren't nice. Herrera has a reason to be upset because nobody is supposed to put their hand on another during the match, especially managers. 
A strong punishment should be coming for Cristante for that throat grab, but he's probably feeling lucky that Herrera didn't use his super powers to destroy him.

The recipe for success in any team sport is, undoubtedly, teamwork. And the recipe for disaster? Getting into fights with teammates in the middle of the game. And that's what happened to Auxerre in their 4-1 loss to Quevilly Rouen in France's second division on Saturday. Check it out as Mickael Barreto and Pierre-Yves Polomat come to blows after a little back and forth:
BİLGİ | Dün akşam Quevilly Rouen - Auxerre karşılaşmasında Auxerre takımında forma giyen Polomat ve Barreto ikilisi maç içinde birbirine girdi. Maçın hakemi her iki oyuncuyu da kırmızı kartla cezalandırdı. #Ligue2 pic.twitter.com/b1Ne5SOqPZ
Goodness me. There goes the locker room. I have a feeling this clash wasn't over who grabbed the last croissant at breakfast. Both deservedly got red cards, and they'll probably get a further suspension for that. 
It all seems to stem from some sequence in the match that they didn't agree on. It could have been about defensive marking, poor execution together in the final third or one claiming they had UMBC beating Virginia in their bracket . 
On the bright side, opportunities for bench players!

With the stacked UFC 223 card approaching on April 7 in Brooklyn, New York, we're entering what's shaping up to be an exciting time of the year for the UFC. As we roll through 2018, the news and rumors within the mixed martial arts world are steadily coming in, and we at CBS Sports are here to keep you updated on some of the biggest headlines making the rounds. Let's have a look at some of the biggest stories for Monday, March 19. 
Knockout artist Francis Ngannou was unsuccessful in his quest to take the UFC heavyweight championship away from Stipe Miocic at UFC 220, so now he's on a road back to title contention. To get back to being the No. 1 contender in the division, Ngannou will have to dispose of some big names along the way, and it certainly seems there are some nice options on the table in that regard. 
Can't get enough UFC? Subscribe to my podcast In This Corner with Brian Campbell where we break down everything you need to know in the Octagon.
Two top heavyweight names have already called for the chance to face Ngannou next. Mark Hunt recently told Sporting News that he would like to get into the Octagon with the Cameroon-native on the Hawaii card in August, while the always-outspoken Derrick Lewis has been clamoring to face Ngannou as well. As it pertains to Lewis, Ngannou seems to be very much up for that. 
Derrick  has been talking some of his sh*t while I was off . Can someone please let him know that I'm here now, so if he really wants me, he should send his manager to deal with @ufc
But, what does Ngannou want? Who does the former title challenger see himself getting into the Octagon with if it were up to him? Well, as he told Ariel Helwani on ""The MMA Hour"" on Monday, he would love to see Brock Lesnar make his rumored UFC return so those two can step inside the cage to do battle. 
""Please Brock, come back, come back my friend. We need you here,"" Ngannou said. ""We need you to put the fun in this division. I need you to give me that f------ fight I've been waiting for for a long time, I've been dreaming for."" 
Again, if he wants another shot at the UFC heavyweight title down the road, then Ngannou will have to start picking up some wins over established names. It's clear that he does have some good options on the table -- with his personal option maybe being the best one in terms of establishing himself once again as a legitimate threat in the division.

Fabricio Werdum has been on a quest to earn back the UFC heavyweight championship that he lost to current titleholder Stipe Miocic, and to this point, he has seemed on track to earn a shot down the road somewhere with wins in his last two fights.
Well, that quest came to a screeching halt on Saturday at UFC London as Werdum was finished in the fourth round by up-and-coming prospect Alexander Volkov. With Werdum busted up a bit after three rounds of action, Volkov seemed poised to pounce in the fourth, and that's exactly what he did. 
So while Werdum's heavyweight title hopes took a serious hit, everyone was issued a formal introduction to the young prospect Volkov. At just 29 years old and now with a win over the 40-year-old Werdum under his belt, there's undoubtedly a new contender to get excited about in a UFC heavyweight division that has been lacking star power as Miocic has torn through everyone put in front of him. 
THAT. IS. IT.@AlexDragoVolkov gets the biggest win of his career at #UFCLondon! He stops Werdum in round 4! pic.twitter.com/YMSFE7udiq
The monumental win over the legend Werdum moves the former Bellator MMA champion Volkov to 4-0 in his UFC career, so it won't be long before UFC president Dana White starts taking questions on when the youngster will get a shot at the UFC heavyweight championship.

There are only a few fights that fans of the UFC believe absolutely must happen at some point in the near future, and one of those bouts is a women's super clash between featherweight champion Cris Cyborg and bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes. But as time goes on, it seems there's a delay in making the fight happen in some form or fashion, and one of the women involved seems to be at the end of her rope. Let's have a look at this as well as some of the other UFC news making the rounds for Friday, March 16. 
The women's featherweight champion seems to be the one growing impatient as the fight fails to become set in stone. In the wake of the announcement that Nunes' next fight will take place on the UFC 224 card in Brazil on May 12 against Raquel Pennington, Cyborg released a lengthy statement to MMA Fighting in which she specifically stated that should Nunes not accept a fight on the UFC 226 on July 7 card in Las Vegas during International Fight Week, then she will not invest anymore of her energy in trying to make the fight happen. Furthermore, Cyborg then went on to explain that if Nunes changes her mind and absolutely wants the superfight to go down, then she will have to place herself in the featherweight division to prove herself before she receives a title shot. 
Seeing as there was a period of time where Nunes was the one heavily clamoring for this showdown, you can see where Cyborg's frustrations come from. At one point, Nunes was very adamant about stepping into the Octagon with the polarizing Cyborg, and then that vigor just disappeared. To that point, Cyborg believes this was a tactic used by Nunes simply to receive a better deal from the UFC, which is a theory that does make sense, to a degree. 
With Nunes defending her title against Pennington in May, there is a good chance this fight does not take place by self-imposed the deadline. But, don't get too depressed about maybe never seeing it happen because we all know that when it comes to the fight game, the right money can make anything happen. 
It's happening!! #UFCLiverpool is official for May 27!🎟 https://t.co/shPzwVYT9Lpic.twitter.com/rIIwOylJxo

After a successful reintroduction to Olympic golf in 2016 at the Rio Games, the format and qualifying process will stay the same for 2020 in Tokyo, according to a report by Golf Channel.
There had been some talk of a potential team event, a match play format or maybe even some mixing of the men's and women's side, all of which would have been a lot of fun. Instead, we'll get the same 72 holes of stroke play we get every week on the PGA Tour.
Sigh. https://t.co/9U1B3BvdbZ
At the 2016 Olympics in Rio, Justin Rose of England took the gold medal, while Henrik Stenson of Sweden took silver and Matt Kuchar of the United States took bronze. The event was far more entertaining than I thought it would be, but there was a real opportunity to take it to the next level.
Alas, the governing bodies in charge of the sport have chosen the status quo.
Potential Olympic golfers for the 2020 Games in Tokyo were informed on Monday that the qualification process for both the men's and women's competitions will remain unchanged.
Kasumigaseki Country Club will be the host course when the Olympics head to Tokyo in 2020.

The PGA Tour is heading to Austin, Texas, this week for the 2018 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play. Arnold Palmer Invitational winner Rory McIlroy is the Vegas favorite at 7/1, followed closely by last year's Match Play champion, Dustin Johnson, at 8/1. McIlroy opened at 15/2 before moving up the odds board slightly.
Before you make any bets or enter a daily fantasy golf tournament on DraftKings or FanDuel, you'll want to hear what the team at SportsLine has to say.
SportsLine's prediction model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, was all over Tiger Woods at the Valspar Championship two weeks ago. Despite being a 25/1 long shot, the model projected him as a top contender. The result: Woods shot 70 or better all four days and finished tied for second place. Last week, Woods continued his impressive play with a fifth-place finish at Bay Hill. Anybody who used their model had plenty of great value selections to choose from. 
Now that the field for the 2018 WGC-Match Play is locked, SportsLine simulated the event 10,000 times and the results were surprising.
One huge surprise the model is calling for at the WGC-Match Play this week: Tommy Fleetwood, a 30/1 long shot, makes a serious run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. 
Fleetwood is coming off a disappointing performance at last week's Arnold Palmer Invitational that saw him finish outside the top 25 for just the second time this year. However, he has been hot this season with a top-five finish at the Honda Classic and a third-place finish at the Hero World Challenge -- an unofficial PGA Tour event.
Fleetwood is in the top 10 on the PGA Tour in scoring average at 69.647 and has an Official World Golf Ranking of 12. He's in the top 30 in driving accuracy percentage (66.79, 22nd), holes per eagle (120.0, 28th), birdie average (4.05, 27th), and sand save percentage (56.52, 30th).
Another surprise: Phil Mickelson, who has four consecutive top-10 finishes, doesn't sniff the top 12. He's somebody to completely steer clear of this week.
Mickelson is outside the top 200 on the PGA Tour in driving accuracy percentage at 48.73 and his greens in regulation percentage is just 63.08, outside the top 150. He was eliminated in last year's Match Play quarterfinals.
Also, the model says three additional golfers with odds of 25/1 or longer will make a deep run at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play title. Anyone who bets on these underdogs could hit it big.
So who wins the 2018 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play title this year? And which long shots stun the golfing world? Check out the updated odds below and visit SportsLine now to see the full projected leaderboard from the model that has been red-hot so far this season, and find out.

Rory McIlroy posted some pretty outrageous numbers on Sunday at the 2018 Arnold Palmer Invitational en route to the 14th PGA Tour victory of his career. His 64 tied for the best round anyone shot all week, and he didn't make a bogey for the final 25 holes. All of it added up to a three-stroke win over Bryson DeChambeau at Bay Hill.
""I just went out with the mindset today of being patient,"" said Mcilroy in the wake of the victory. ""I was even par through five holes and four behind Henrik at that point. I hit it into the bunker off the tee on No. 6, so I just really tried to stay patient out there, and after that I just played a perfect round of golf. 
""I gave myself birdie chances on basically every hole. Just executed shots the way I wanted to when I needed to. Yeah, 64 in those conditions out there, with it being firm and fast, to get into the winner's circle again, it feels really good. Really proud of myself, how I hung in there over the pass sort of year, with injuries and taking a little bit of time off at the end of last year to sort of get myself right coming into this year and all that work, hard work has finally paid off. I kept telling everyone, even when I was missing cuts and finishing 60th, it wasn't that far away, so just a couple little tweaks here and there and it's nice to be in this position again.""
Here are three stats that show how McIlroy took home his first win since the end of 2016.
1. Proximity to the hole on Sunday: McIlroy's average distance to the cup on his approach shots on Sunday was 24 feet. That was No. 1 in the field for Round 4, and he finished No. 1 in the field in that category for the tournament. He hit 12 (!) approach shots to 21 feet or better. Twelve! He was hole high all over the course, which is a good formula for once again hoisting trophies.
2. Strokes gained putting: McIlroy gained over 2.5 strokes against the field per round with his putter. The real upset would have been him somehow not winning this tournament. Not only was this the best performance of his PGA Tour career, but it was nearly three strokes better overall than any other showing on the greens he's ever put together.

3. Driving distance of 317 yards: McIlroy led the Bay Hill field in driving distance, and it's easy to see why when you watch shots like the one he hit 373 yards on No. 16 on Sunday. He averaged 336 yards off the tee in Round 4 and slightly less than that for the event.

SAN ANTONIO — Ten seconds before the end of the 2017-18 season, a member of the most unselfish team in college basketball committed a rare act of greed.
As Villanova's Collin Gillespie prepared to receive an inbounds pass and dribble out the clock in Monday's 79-62 victory over Michigan in the NCAA title game, teammate Donte DiVincenzo stepped in his path.
""I got this!"" DiVincenzo said as he caught the pass and began trotting up the court. ""I got it!""
Moments later, as the final horn sounded at the Alamodome, DiVincenzo launched the ball toward the rafters and pumped his fists. Confetti danced in the air as his teammates engulfed him just past mid-court—a moment DiVincenzo will cherish forever.
""I wanted to be the one,"" DiVincenzo chuckled about an hour later, ""to throw the ball up in the air at the end.""
DiVincenzo certainly earned the celebratory heave. The Wildcats sixth man didn't start Monday's game. But, boy, did he finish.

In one of the top performances in NCAA championship history, DiVincenzo scored 31 points on 10-of-15 shooting to spark Villanova to its second national title in three years. The redshirt sophomore connected on five of his seven attempts from beyond the arc and also tallied three assists and two blocks—a stat line that earned him Most Outstanding Player honors at the Final Four.
DiVincenzo's 31 points were the most ever by a non-starter in a national championship game, and they were the most by any player since 1989.
""It's surreal,"" DiVincenzo's mother, Kathie, said from her first-row seat. Her voice cracked as she wiped away tears. ""I'm just so proud of him. I can't wait to hug him.""
Kathie waved to her son as he stood with his teammates on a makeshift awards stage at center court. Already sporting a championship T-shirt and hat, Donte fought back tears, too, as he reflected silently on the journey that led him to this moment.
Two years earlier, DiVincenzo's inaugural season at Villanova had been cut short after just eight games because of a broken bone in his foot. Even though he was granted a medical redshirt, the situation was maddening for DiVincenzo, who wore a suit and watched from Villanova's bench as Kris Jenkins' swished three-pointer at the buzzer beat North Carolina in the 2016 NCAA title game.
Amid the on-court celebration that night in Houston, Wildcats guard Jalen Brunson—then only a freshman—wrapped his arm around his best friend and roommate.
""We need to get back,"" Brunson told DiVincenzo. ""We need to get back and share (a moment like) this together.""

Two years later, that explains why Brunson, the Associated Press National Player of the Year, was bawling when he embraced DiVincenzo after Monday's win.
""He's just so special,"" Brunson said. ""He works his butt off and deserves all of this. In practice, he just goes at everybody. He just has this mindset that he's a killer.""
DiVincenzo's swagger was one of the main things that caught the attention of Wildcats coach Jay Wright during the recruiting process four years ago. A Delaware native, DiVincenzo wasn't even a Top 100 prospect when he committed to Villanova over Syracuse as a high school junior in January of 2014. Still, Wright was confident he'd found a sleeper with tremendous upside.
Brunson, who'd yet to commit, said he almost stopped considering Villanova once he knew DiVincenzo was going there. Brunson had played against DiVincenzo on the AAU circuit.
""The first time I met him was at an airport,"" Brunson said. ""He was like, 'Yo, yo, yo … come to Villanova.' I was like, 'Hell no.' I knew he was a great player, there was no reason for me to go there.""
But Brunson indeed ended up in a Wildcats uniform.
And multiple times during the last three seasons, the future NBA first-round pick and the rest of the Wildcats have drawn inspiration from DiVincenzo. That includes DiVincenzo's redshirt year in 2015-16. Once his foot had healed, DiVincenzo was able to practice with the Wildcats. During some workouts he was so hot that Wright nicknamed him ""The Michael Jordan of Delaware.""

In the practices leading up to the 2016 Final Four game against Oklahoma, DiVincenzo played the role of trigger-happy Sooners star Buddy Hield. Villanova limited Hield and ended up winning that game by 44 points before defeating UNC two nights later.
Last season, as a redshirt freshman, DiVincenzo averaged 8.8 points off the bench and served an even bigger role by setting a tone of intensity in practice.
""We got into it a lot,"" said former Wildcats forward Josh Hart, who is now a rookie with the Los Angeles Lakers. ""There were definitely some physical altercations. We threw some blows. That's that competitive nature, that drive to get each other better.
""We've proven it's not about one-and-dones. It's about high character guys who are talented and want to buy into something bigger than themselves. (DiVincenzo) is someone who came in, wasn't highly ranked in ESPN's BS rankings, but came in and worked and got better and developed and became a national champion.""
As startling as DiVincenzo's stat line in Monday's title game may have been to some, the Wildcats were hardly surprised. DiVincenzo averaged 13 points on the season and scored 20 or more points five times. That includes a 30-point game against Butler in which he played all 40 minutes in place of injured starter Phil Booth.
At 6'5"" and 205 pounds, DiVincenzo's size, shooting ability and explosiveness would make him a shoo-in to start on almost any team in America. Instead, he accepted and embraced his role off the bench at Villanova, where he was named Big East Sixth Man of the Year this season.
""Donte competed for a starting position,"" Wright said. ""He worked really hard and wanted to start, and he was initially a little upset because he wasn't starting. A little. Not bad, because he's just a great kid.
""We want our players to have a clear mind. We want them to be able to go out there and not worry about whether they're coming off the bench or whether they're getting enough shots or whether the NBA guys are watching them. We feel like, to be a good player, you've got to have a free mind.""

DiVincenzo certainly did against Michigan, and the Wildcats benefitted greatly on a night when their other stars didn't look all that crisp early.
Michigan led 21-14 at the 10:59 mark of the first half before DiVincenzo scored 12 points during a 23-7 march that left Villanova up 37-28 at intermission. DiVincenzo had 18 points at the break and 13 more in the second stanza, when Villanova led by as many as 22 points.
If not for a uncontested basket by Michigan with 10 seconds remaining, Villanova's victory margin would've been the biggest in an NCAA title game since UNLV beat Duke 103-73 in 1990.
""Even if we had played our best,"" Michigan coach John Beilein said, ""it would have been very difficult to win that game with what DiVincenzo did. Sometimes those individual performances just beat you, and you just say, 'OK, we played you the best we could, and tonight, you were better than us.'
""It was an incredible performance. When he came off and hit those 3s, we couldn't answer. I wish we would have maybe gone out and doubled him or something. ... But he still made some really long shots that I don't think there's a defense for.""
Along with his five three-pointers, DiVincenzo also had a dunk that should make the Final Four highlight reel. So should his vicious, clean block of Charles Matthews' layup attempt.
DiVincenzo was asked in the postgame press conference if he expected this type of performance.
""Honestly, no,"" he said. ""I did not think I was going to have this type of night, because every night I come into a game, I just try to bring energy. And if we get off to a good start, I try to take it to a new level.""
After swishing a shot toward the end of the game, DiVincenzo winked at Hart—who was watching from the stands with Jenkins and other former Wildcats—as he ran down the court.
""We got another one,"" he yelled.

The question now is whether DiVincenzo will have an opportunity to add to his trophy case in 2018-19. Brunson and standout guard Mikal Bridges are both expected to leave school a year early for the NBA draft. Forward Omari Spellman might, too.
The buzz after Monday's game was that DiVincenzo's showing at the Final Four—he had 15 points against Kansas two nights earlier—could make him an NBA draft candidate, as well.
""He's definitely going to play in our league,"" a scout told B/R by phone late Monday night. ""He'd probably get drafted in the second round right now. But at the end of the day I think he'd be better off in college for one more year.""
If that happens, you can bet DiVincenzo won't be coming off the bench.
DiVincenzo smiled.
""I guess we'll see,"" he said. ""You'll have to talk to Coach about that.""",sports

The Villanova Wildcats are the national champions in men's college basketball for the second time in three years.
It was a topsy-turvy tournament filled with upsets and last-second drama, but the No. 1 seed out of the Big East was immune to the chaos and the close calls. Villanova won all six of its games by at least a 12-point margin, including a 79-62 cruise-control victory over Michigan in the title game.
It goes without saying that the Wildcats were the biggest winners of this Big Dance, but they weren't the only ones—nor were the Michigan Wolverines the only losers.
The One Shining Moment montage was a nice walk down memory lane of the past three weeks, but that only scraped the surface of everything that transpired in this edition of March Madness.
Here's the full list of the biggest winners and losers from the 2018 men's NCAA tournament.

Loyola-Chicago's run was an unbelievable story, but we've seen No. 11 seeds reach the Final Four before. In due time, the Ramblers will be interchangeable with 2006 George Mason and 2011 VCU on the list of the unlikeliest national semifinalists.
But a No. 16 seed beating a No. 1 seed?
That's what the 2018 NCAA tournament will always be remembered for.
UMBC didn't just beat No. 1 overall seed Virginia, either. The Retrievers made history by stomping the heavily favored Cavaliers. No team this season had scored more than 68 points against Tony Bennett's vaunted pack-line defense, but UMBC scored 53 just in the second half of the 74-54 beatdown.
Jairus Lyles battled through leg cramps for most of the second half to finish with 28 points on a scant 11 field-goal attempts. As a team, the Retrievers—who mustered up a mere 39 points in a blowout loss to Albany in late January—shot 54.2 percent from the field and 12-of-24 (50 percent) from three-point range.
A No. 16 seed was bound to win one sooner or later, but that inevitability didn't make UMBC's victory any less mind-blowing.

Generally speaking, using NCAA tournament results to make overarching statements about the strength or weakness of a conference is a silly exercise.
People who don't like a certain conference—usually the ACC or Big 12, since those have been the top leagues for the past few years—will point to the league's .500 or worse record after the first weekend and say, ""See! They aren't that good!"" It's dumb to disregard hundreds of regular-season games and instead focus on a couple of results in an unpredictable tournament, but what are sports without hot takes?
That said, the Pac-12 was clearly the worst power conference during the regular season, and it didn't do much to refute that stance by getting completely eliminated from the tournament by the end of the first full day.
Only three Pac-12 teams received an invitation to the Big Dance. Arizona was a No. 4 seed and a strong candidate to win the title. UCLA and Arizona State were sent to Dayton for First Four games.
Both the Bruins and the Sun Devils were downright dreadful in their immediate exits. UCLA scored just 58 points against St. Bonaventure, but that's better than Arizona State's 56 points against Syracuse. As a result of those duds, the Pac-12 only had one team in the round of 64.
Buffalo promptly blew out Arizona 89-68, ensuring that many brackets across the nation were busted about 12 hours after the first round began.
To make matters worse, both the West Coast Conference (Gonzaga) and Mountain West Conference (Nevada) reached the Sweet 16, so those leagues have temporary bragging rights over the Pac-12 as the best of the West.

As was the case in 2016, we can argue about whether Syracuse belonged in the NCAA tournament in the first place, but there's no denying how well the Orange (and their defense) did with the gift they were given by the selection committee.
To get things started, they held Arizona State to 56 points in the First Four. It was just the third time all season the Sun Devils failed to score 70 points and the first time they were held below 64—despite making 11 three-pointers in the game.
After that, Syracuse shut down TCU and Michigan State, allowing 52 and 53 points, respectively. Both the Horned Frogs and Spartans are still ranked in the top 20 in the nation in three-point percentage, but neither squad could get anything to fall against the 2-3 zone from hell. They were collectively 11-of-54 (20.4 percent) from downtown.
Even in the Sweet 16 loss to Duke, Syracuse's defense was fierce. The Blue Devils averaged 85.7 points in their other three tournament games, but they could only manage 69 points against the Orange.
Here's the scary news for the rest of the country: Syracuse's entire starting lineup has at least one more year of eligibility remaining, so that stingy zone isn't going anywhere anytime soon. If the Orange can just figure out something on offense next season, there shouldn't be anything controversial about their invitation to the 2019 NCAA tournament.

It was a rough year for seed-based axioms.
""A No. 16 seed has never beaten a No. 1 seed.""
So much for that.
""At least one No. 12 seed almost always beats a No. 5 seed.""
Looks like that one belongs in the garbage, too.
However, there were a couple of close calls for the underdogs in the sexiest annual upset pick.
Davidson gave Kentucky one heck of a run for its money, storming back from an early 13-point deficit to tie things up in the final 10 minutes. It wasn't meant to be, though, as the Wildcats from Lexington edged out the Wildcats from the Charlotte area.
South Dakota State had Ohio State on the ropes, as well. The Jackrabbits were tied with the Buckeyes in the final two minutes prior to fouling Kam Williams on back-to-back three-point attempts to blow the game.
In the end, No. 12 seeds went 0-4.
No. 13 seeds, on the other hand, went 2-2 in the first round, and each of those losses came by just a four-point margin. Meanwhile, No. 9 seeds had a combined total of seven wins with both Kansas State and Florida State reaching the Elite Eight. In the previous four tournaments combined, No. 9 seeds had just five wins and zero Sweet 16 appearances.

Houston's Rob Gray Jr. and Purdue's Matt Haarms were two of the most popular players of the early rounds of the tournament.
Yes, both guys are excellent players. Gray was unbelievable in the first round, scoring 39 of Houston's 67 points in a win over San Diego State. And at 7'3"", it should come as no surprise that Haarms is a fine shot-blocker. In fact, he rejected multiple shots in each of Purdue's three games.
However, it wasn't the play that had social media buzzing about them so much as it was their (drastically different) hairstyles.
Gray has been rocking a top knot all season. (Yes, it's a top knot. It's not a man bun. Nor was Kyle Guy's situation a man bun last year. Learn the difference.) And what we all found out in March is that his 10-year-old brother, Jackson, has the same hairstyle. Reporters in Wichita really dropped the ball by not asking Rob how much hair product he uses to keep that hair tied up so neatly all game.
Then there's Haarms, with his comically unkempt hair. Haarms readjusts his hair so often within the game that the NCAA March Madness Twitter account made a mixtape of nothing else. And during Purdue's Sweet 16 game against Texas Tech, TBS even flashed up a graphic of how many hair adjustments Haarms had already made at an early point in the game.
Unfortunately, this was the last we'll see of Gray at the collegiate level, since he's a senior. Haarms is only a redshirt freshman, though, so we've got up to three more years of #HaarmsHair.
It's a shame Miami was eliminated just a few hours into the first round. Given our infatuation with unique hairdos in this year's tournament, there's no question Lonnie Walker IV's pineapple style would have gotten a fair amount of attention if the Hurricanes had been able to hang around for a couple of games.

This was supposed to be an incredible tournament for the Buckeye State.
Xavier earned a No. 1 seed for the first time in program history. Cincinnati (No. 2) was a top-three seed for the first time since 2002. Ohio State surprised everyone this year by not only making the Big Dance but doing so as a No. 5 seed. And even No. 14 seed Wright State had legitimate first-round upset potential.
By the end of the second round, though, the state had been wiped off the tournament map.
Tennessee smashed Wright State 73-47 in the first round. At no point was that game even remotely in doubt. The other three teams survived their openers, but both Ohio State and Cincinnati were pushed to the limit, while Xavier gave up 83 points in an ugly game against Texas Southern.
All three teams proceeded to blow second-half leads in their second games.
Ohio State's letdown was the most forgivable, as it never led Gonzaga by more than five points and only held the lead for a couple of minutes. Plus, the Zags were the favorites, so things went about as expected.
Xavier, however, blew a 12-point lead with less than 10 minutes remaining against No. 9 seed Florida State, outscored 18-4 in the final few minutes. And even that wasn't the most embarrassing meltdown, as Cincinnati led Nevada 65-43 with 11 minutes to go, only for the Wolf Pack to finish the game on a 32-8 run.
Because of all those blown leads, Ohio was unrepresented in the Sweet 16 for just the second time in the last 12 years. (It also happened in 2016.)

It's important to note up front that close basketball games are not necessarily good basketball games. There are certainly plenty which are both.
Duke vs. Kansas in the Elite Eight might have been the most riveting game of the season. And you're not much of a fan if you weren't on the edge of your seat for first-round gems like Wichita State vs. Marshall, Nevada vs. Texas and Houston vs. San Diego State.
For every one of those exciting battles, though, it seems like there are several ugly games like Auburn vs. College of Charleston, Kentucky vs. Kansas State and pick a Syracuse or Loyola-Chicago game that just happened to be close at the end because neither team could score with any regularity.
Having said that, there sure was a lot of last-second drama this year.
In total, there were 26 games decided by five points or fewer, including a trio of overtime affairs. In 11 of those games, the final margin was just one possession.
Save for Villanova, every team in the Final Four had multiple nail-biters.
Loyola-Chicago's first three games were decided by a combined total of just four points, and all three featured a clutch bucket by a (different) Rambler in the final seven seconds.
Michigan had the only true buzzer-beater of the tournament when Jordan Poole's game-winner against Houston went in with no time left on the clock, but the Wolverines also had a close call (58-54) against Florida State in the Elite Eight.
Kansas won three consecutive games by exactly a four-point margin, the last of which was only possible when Grayson Allen's attempted buzzer-beater rolled around the rim twice before falling out and resulting in overtime.
Both of Houston's games came right down to the final shot. Nevada played one overtime game and two others decided by a combined margin of three points in regulation. And who can forget Gonzaga's Zach Norvell Jr. draining a huge three-pointer in the final minute in each of its first two games?
But, please, keep putting quotation marks around the word ""experts"" when our predictions for this wild tournament aren't 100 percent accurate. There's a reason no one has ever filled out a perfect bracket, and it's not from lack of research.

Auburn was never the same after losing Anfernee McLemore to a nasty leg injury in mid-February.
Prior to that, the Tigers were 23-3 and flirting with a possible No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. After the injury, however, they lost four of their final six games and were a shell of their former selves, particularly on the defensive end without the elite shot-blocker.
And Auburn was nothing short of awful in its brief stay in the NCAA tournament.
In the first round, the Tigers survived a hideous game against College of Charleston. They shot 20.8 percent from three-point range, missed 17 free throws and just generally looked like they had no business being in the tournament. Somehow, the Cougars were even worse, committing 21 turnovers and struggling just as miserably from the three-point and free-throw lines in the 62-58 game that was anything but an instant classic.
In the following game against Clemson, Auburn was mercilessly obliterated.
It was 70-29 midway through the second half before Clemson finally called off the dogs. Even with some late scoring to make the final score a not-quite-as-depressing 84-53, Auburn shot just 29.4 percent from inside the arc, managing to average just 0.75 points per possession in a game where it only committed six turnovers.
This wasn't the biggest blowout in NCAA tournament history. Heck, just last year, No. 4 seed Purdue lost to Kansas by 32 in the Sweet 16. But it felt like one of the most embarrassing showings from a top-four seed.

In the 13 years since reaching the 2005 national championship game with Illinois, Bruce Weber's resume was nothing special.
Weber entered this year's Big Dance with a combined NCAA tournament record of 3-7 dating back to 2006. None of those wins came against a team seeded better than No. 8, and two of the losses were to a No. 12 seed and a No. 13 seed.
His teams missed the tournament five times in the span of nine years, which resulted in his termination from the Illini job. And excluding his first season at Kansas State with Frank Martin's players, Weber has a 41-49 record in Big 12 play.
Save for maybe Sean Miller, no one needed a critics-silencing run in the tournament more than Weber.
Despite being forced to carry on without star big man Dean Wade, Weber did exactly that, winning as many games in this tourney as he did in the last 12 combined.
Kansas State got some serious help from UMBC upsetting Virginia, but it's not like the Wildcats had a cake walk to the Elite Eight. They had to dig in their heels on defense both against Creighton and Kentucky, somehow holding those teams to season lows in scoring.
If the wins didn't shut up the critics, Weber can now afford to pay to silence them. Per Sean Isabella of Woodward News, Weber got a $430,000 bonus for reaching the Elite Eight.

With the exception of Jay Wright at Villanova, no coach has had a more impressive five-year run than Virginia's Tony Bennett.
Excluding the NCAA tournaments, the Cavaliers are 136-28 (82.9 percent) since the start of the 2013-14 season. During that time, they have three outright ACC regular-season championships and two conference tournament titles. They earned No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament in 2014 and 2016, and they were the overall No. 1 seed this year.
Bennett was named the AP National Coach of the Year for this season.
But even before this season, that success was not translating to the Big Dance. The Cavaliers were eliminated by a No. 5 seed in 2014, a No. 7 seed in 2015 and a No. 10 seed in 2016. In all three seasons, they failed to live up to the expectation of their seed line. Over the previous four years, the Cavaliers cobbled together a combined record of 7-4 with only one Elite Eight appearance and two Sweet 16s.
Losing to a No. 5 seed sounds a heck of a lot better than what happened this year, though, as Bennett and Virginia ended up on the wrong side of history with the first-round loss to No. 16 seed UMBC.
Bennett was already battling the stigma of a coach who can't win when it matters most, but this year is going to follow him for the rest of his career. Even if Virginia wins the national championship next season, we will still be reminded every single March of how risky it is to trust this coach, regardless of how successful he is during the regular season.

For the most part, the NCAA tournament has minimal impact on NBA draft stock. At any rate, failing to qualify for the Big Dance didn't stop Ben Simmons or Markelle Fultz from being selected with the No. 1 overall picks in the last two years.
But there are always a few guys who make a big impression on NBA scouts with their play in March.
Two of those players this year were Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Malik Newman.
The former had been the MVP for Kentucky for most of the year, despite coming off the bench for 13 of the first 15 games and in spite of the fact that everyone thought either Kevin Knox or Hamidou Diallo would fill that role.
The 6'6"" point guard had at least 15 points, five assists and five rebounds in each of his three appearances in the NCAA tournament. Over his final 10 games, Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 19.0 points, 6.7 assists and 5.3 rebounds. Before that stretch, there was at least a chance he'd be back for another year. That's no longer the case.
Likewise, Newman's run in the NCAA tournament piggybacked on what was already a strong finish to the season. Kansas' sophomore wing averaged 24.0 points per game in the Big 12 tournament before exploding for 28 points in the second round against Seton Hall and 32 in the Elite Eight against Duke. His previous career high was 27 points, but he scored more than 27 three times in the span of seven games in March.
Newman was a complete afterthought in NBA draft discussions one month ago, but with his recent play and leadership for the Jayhawks, he just might be a first-round pick if he decides to make the leap.

One could just about sum up the 2017-18 season with two words: Ebbs and flows. An absurd number of teams—many of them in the SEC, for some reason—looked like potential national champions in one game and likely first-round flameouts in the next.
Nevada was a great example. The Wolf Pack bounced in and out of the AP Top 25 during the regular season, largely because they went 0-4 in their first four games as a ranked team. It was as if they were more comfortable when they weren't the heavy favorite.
It's only fitting, then, that Nevada was the king of comebacks in the NCAA tournament.
In the first round against Texas, the Wolf Pack trailed by 14 early in the second half and did not have the lead at any point in the final 38 minutes of regulation. But they battled back and forced overtime, where they scored on each and every possession to win the game.
That was nothing compared to the second comeback, though. Nevada was down by 22 with less than 11 minutes remaining against Cincinnati—a team which had one of the best defenses in the nation. The Wolf Pack went on a 22-6 run over their next 10 possessions to close the gap. They finally took their first lead with less than 10 seconds remaining, sealing the victory.
Even though Nevada didn't win the Sweet 16 game against Loyola-Chicago, it still had a nice comeback. Down by as many as a dozen points early in the second half and still trailing by 10 with less than eight minutes to go, Cody Martin and Co. went on a 12-2 run to tie things up.
All told, the Wolf Pack trailed by a combined margin of 48 points in the second halves of their tournament games, and it resulted in two wins and a one-point loss. No lead was safe against these guys.

We'll eventually forget the individual players who helped carry Loyola-Chicago to the Final Four. If you need proof, try to remember the leading scorers for VCU in 2011 or Florida Gulf Coast in 2013.
Maybe 2 percent of you can come up with those players (Jamie Skeen and Sherwood Brown) off the top of your head, but most of you probably recall ""HAVOC"" and ""Dunk City.""
Well, you'll always remember the 2018 Ramblers for Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt.
All other entities in this year's tournament paled in comparison to the popularity of Loyola-Chicago's 98-year-old team chaplain. Normally, my wife could not care less about brackets or basketball, but she was obsessed with the sweet old lady she dubbed ""Grandma Gryffindor.""
Sister Jean had a press conference during media week at the Final Four, and there were so many attendees that they were lined up out the door just to catch a glimpse of the tournament's biggest celebrity.
The funny thing is she has been the team's chaplain since 1994—longer than every current head coach in D-I basketball except for Jim Boeheim, Mike Krzyzewski, Greg Kampe and Bob McKillop. She was already so popular on campus that the Ramblers had a Sister Jean bobblehead giveaway in February 2011. We had plenty of time to turn this woman into a national phenomenon, but hardly anyone outside of Chicago knew about her until Donte Ingram, Clayton Custer and Marques Townes started draining clutch shots at the end of games.
And now, there are rebooted bobbleheads that are selling like hotcakes. Per Marisa Marcellino of NBC Sports, the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum started a presale for Sister Jean bobbleheads on March 23, and they received more than 13,000 orders (at $25 apiece) in less than a week. Some of the original collectibles have been selling on eBay for hundreds of dollars.

When Michigan and Villanova squared off in the national championship game, it was impossible not to notice something.
Both of the starting centers were leading their teams in three-point percentage for the season.
That growing trend hit a tipping point this year, particularly in the tournament.
Duke made it to the Elite Eight with its two big men (Marvin Bagley III and Wendell Carter Jr.) serving as two of the most accurate perimeter shooters on the roster. Gonzaga was one of the top candidates to reach the Final Four and might have gotten there if not for an injury suffered by its three-point-shooting center (Killian Tillie) before the Sweet 16. And then there's Nevada, where most of the time was spent with five 6'7"" players with three-point range on the floor.
Who needs a stretch 4 when you can have a stretch 5?
Even with the increase in three-point rate, recent national champions always had conventional big men patrolling the paint. In fact, you have to go all the way back through Kennedy Meeks, Daniel Ochefu, Jahlil Okafor and Amida Brimah to find the last time the starting center of a national champion had actually made a three-pointer in his career, and Louisville's Gorgui Dieng only made one triple in three seasons.
Are these runs fueled by Moritz Wagner and Omari Spellman the sign of the impending extinction of the back-to-the-basket big man?

There have been some phenomenal unexpected performances in the national championship over the years. Villanova's Phil Booth came out of nowhere for 20 points in the 2016 title game. The year before that, Grayson Allen came off the bench for 16 points. And though the NCAA wants us to believe the game never happened, who can ever forget Luke Hancock vs. Spike Albrecht in 2013?
Those guys are now all footnotes behind Donte DiVincenzo.
It was a tough night against Michigan for Villanova's starters. Mikal Bridges ended up scoring a bunch after the intermission, but it was sixth man or bust in the first half. DiVincenzo scored 18 of the Wildcats' 37 points in the first half, and he just about single-handedly carried them on a 23-7 run over the final 11 minutes of the half.
He finished with 31 points, five rebounds, three assists and two blocks to earn Most Outstanding Player honors.
This wasn't the only time he carried Villanova's offense through a slow start in this tournament, though. In the second-round win over Alabama, ""Donte's Inferno"" scored all 18 of his points in the first half while the rest of the Wildcats combined for just 14.
DiVincenzo averaged 15.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.7 assists for the tournament. Not too shabby for a reserve.

When Kentucky won the national championship in 2012, three of its five leading scorers were freshmen who were drafted in the first round.
When Duke won it all in 2015, three of its four leading scorers were freshmen who were drafted in the first round.
But that didn't stop people—most notably Jon Rothstein—from responding to Duke's Elite Eight loss to Kansas with selective memory and recent results to say that you can't win a title with a team made up primarily of one-and-done freshmen.
First of all, John Calipari has been to the Sweet 16 in 11 of the past 13 years, as well as five of the last 11 Final Fours, playing in three national championship games. Does it result in a title every year? Of course not. But it's more effective than any other strategy, as Roy Williams (four) is the only other coach with more than three appearances in the national semifinals during that time.
And if it weren't for P.J. Washington shooting 8-of-20 from the free-throw line against Kansas State, there's a good chance Kentucky's five-freshman starting lineup would have made the Final Four this year.
Moreover, the only reason Duke didn't reach the Final Four is because of a brutal roll on a last-second shot by its only senior (Grayson Allen). If that shot falls or if Kansas doesn't make more three-pointers (13) than any opponent made against the Blue Devils in January, February or March, that's another Final Four team loaded with one-and-done stars.
Heck, with a little bit better luck, it reasonably could have been Duke against Kentucky in the national championship, boasting nine of the top 18 recruits in this past year's class.
It'd be one thing if these one-and-done squads were getting hammered in the first weekend of the tournament year after year. But they are right there among the title contenders every season and have won two of the last seven tournaments. To say it can't be done is just plain dumb.",sports
614,"

Villanova, Michigan and Kansas all made it to the Final Four of the 2018 men's NCAA tournament, and our way-too-early rankings for the 2018-19 season suggest all three could make another deep run next year.
Making early April projections of college basketball rosters is a fool's errand. As always, the next seven weeks will be flooded with news of draft declarations, transfers and late signings of incoming freshmen. And this year, we also have the potential further fallout from the FBI probe.
But the show must go on!
Based on a combination of what we know and reasonable assumptions of who will (and who will not) leave for the NBA, here is our way-too-early ranking of teams for the 2018-19 men's college basketball season:
             
2019 Title Favorite: No. 1 Villanova Wildcats

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Villanova has finished in the top six of the AP Top 25 for five consecutive years, earning either a No. 1 or No. 2 seed in each of those NCAA tournaments. We can spend a portion of this offseason arguing over whether these Wildcats have become a college basketball dynasty, but the fact of the matter is that no one has been better for the past half-decade.
And here's the ridiculous part: There was not a single senior in this year's primary nine-man rotation.
We're assuming Mikal Bridges will leave for the NBA. There's a good chance Jalen Brunson joins him on that one-year-early journey. But Villanova would still be in great shape, thanks in part to a recruiting class that features three of the top 50 prospects on 247Sports' composite rankings—Jahvon Quinerly, Cole Swider and Brandon Slater.
Even without factoring in any of those incoming freshmen, Villanova would have a starting five of Collin Gillespie, Phil Booth, Donte DiVincenzo, Eric Paschall and Omari Spellman, with both Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree and Jermaine Samuels providing valuable minutes off the bench.
If Brunson decides to follow in the footsteps of Josh Hart and North Carolina's Joel Berry II by coming back for one final season rather than maybe getting selected at the end of the first round of the draft, even better. He would be the runaway preseason favorite for the Wooden Award, and Villanova would be the near-unanimous preseason No. 1 team.
                 
Dark-Horse Title Candidate: No. 10 Tennessee Volunteers

Tennessee surprised everyone this year.
It's kind of poetic that the Volunteers landed at No. 13 in the final AP poll as well as No. 13 in the KenPom rankings, since they were projected to finish 13th in the SEC. Instead, they won the conference title and got the highest seed among the eight SEC teams who received an invite to the Big Dance.
This was only the beginning, though.
2017-18 was supposed to be a stepping-stone season for the Vols. Save for Howard graduate transfer James Daniel III, there were no seniors on this roster. And aside from Admiral Schofield and Kyle Alexander, there won't be much of a senior class next year either.
That's because four of this year's five leading scorers were sophomores. Most notable among them, Grant Williams was named the SEC Player of the Year. The big man averaged 15.2 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game, and he is all but guaranteed to be no worse than a third-team All-American when those preseason lists start publishing in October.
Here's the big question for Tennessee: Will this success translate to wins on the recruiting trail? Head coach Rick Barnes was always able to sign big-name talent when he was at Texas, but that has not been the case thus far in Knoxville. The Volunteers do not yet have a single recruit signed in the 2018 class, whiffing on in-state 5-star point guard Darius Garland.
                      
Top Non-Tournament Team: No. 16 Penn State Nittany Lions

Long before Penn State won the NIT, this was a team destined for a ton of way-too-early love.
Five Nittany Lions averaged at least 10 points per game, but injuries and missed opportunities marred the season. Star big man Mike Watkins (12.1 PPG, 8.9 RPG, 2.3 BPG, 1.0 SPG) missed the final nine games because of a right knee injury. Defensive stalwart Josh Reaves (10.6 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 3.1 APG, 2.2 SPG) missed four games in January, resulting in three of Penn State's worst losses of the year.
When the Nittany Lions were at full strength, though, they were impressive. From late January through mid-February, they beat Ohio State twice and nearly won road games against both Michigan State and Purdue.
Will everyone come back next season?
They're definitely losing starting shooting guard Shep Garner as a senior and reserve big man Julian Moore, who's a graduate student. But if Tony Carr, Lamar Stevens, Reaves and Watkins all return, that's one heck of a quartet to build around. It could be an even better version of the fearsome foursome that carried Seton Hall to a 14-2 start to this season.
Watkins has already announced that he'll be returning, but Carr is the wild card. He's on the long list of players who might go late in the first round but whose long-term checkbook would probably benefit from one more year of college ball. Penn State should be second in the preseason Big Ten standings if he does come back.
                                    
Unranked Draft-Dependent Wild Card: Alabama Crimson Tide

Duke and Kentucky are always the toughest teams to peg in these way-too-early rankings. Between not knowing for sure which of their current players will leave for the NBA draft and not knowing how many of the remaining top recruits they'll sign, projecting their rosters in early April is a shot in the dark.
But the Blue Devils and Wildcats will be Top 10 teams regardless of those decisions.
Alabama, on the other hand, could either be top-10 in the nation or an afterthought in the SEC depending on who goes pro.
If everyone comes back, Alabama is going to be loaded. There were 10 players on this roster who averaged at least 4.0 points per game this season. The only senior in that bunch is Riley Norris, and he might get a fifth year of eligibility since he only appeared in nine games this season. And don't forget about Tevin Mack, who averaged 14.8 points per game two seasons ago with Texas before transferring to Tuscaloosa.
Will everyone come back, though?
The obvious big name here is Collin Sexton. Most everyone assumes the surefire lottery pick will declare for June 21's draft, but that's what we thought about Miles Bridges last year, Ivan Rabb the year before that and Marcus Smart in 2013. There's almost always one huge surprise, and Sexton has not yet declared whether he's going to even test the waters, let alone hire an agent.
If that domino decides to remain with the Crimson Tide, perhaps the rest will follow. But if Sexton skips town, could Herb Jones, John Petty and Donta Hall all join him? Not one of those players is a projected first-round pick, but they all have futures in the pros.
Our assumption is that Sexton leaves, Jones declares without an agent before returning and Petty and Hall decide to come back without even testing the waters. Alabama will end up right back where it started this season: Atop the list of ""others receiving votes"" in the preseason AP Top 25.
                      
Noteworthy Absences: Purdue Boilermakers and Xavier Musketeers

These were two of the best teams in the country this season. Xavier won the Big East and earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. And before Isaac Haas suffered a fractured elbow in the first round, Purdue was a strong candidate to win the title as a No. 2 seed.
The problem is that both of those teams were great because they were loaded with seniors, and neither one is a popular destination for top-notch recruits. In fact, neither Purdue nor Xavier has a top-125 recruit in the 2018 class, and neither has an incoming transfer worth mentioning.
The Boilermakers are losing four of their five leading scorers as seniors, and top player Carsen Edwards is at least testing the NBA draft waters. Even if he does come back, it'll be him, Matt Haarms and a bunch of question marks. Meanwhile, the Musketeers are losing all three of their leading scorers, and they already lost head coach Chris Mack to the Louisville Cardinals.
Because both of those programs have been solid for more than a decade, it wouldn't be a huge surprise if they sneak into the preseason Top 25 seven months from now. Based on what the rosters are looking like, though, they won't deserve it.

What's the magic formula to win Most Improved Player in the NBA? 
Are we looking for the man who's received a substantial increase in playing time and operated at a similar level? Should we be seeking out someone who's gone from good to great rather than bad to average or average to good? Is it better to find a player whose underlying metrics are significantly better in a role more suited to his talents?
Truthfully, anything should go. All different kinds of improvement are still valid—an assumption we have to make while trying to decide if award favorite Victor Oladipo is going to be a deserving winner of the MIP trophy.
To objectively determine improvement, we're turning to the formula for Player Score used in previous articles.
For every player in the NBA who's logged even a single minute during both 2016-17 and 2017-18, we pulled scores in four different overarching metrics: NBA Math's total points added (TPA), ESPN.com's real plus/minus wins (RPM Wins), player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares (WS). The first two look at volume/efficiency combinations, while the third focuses on per-possession effectiveness and favors offensive production. The fourth element rewards those whose individual merits lead to more victories. Volume and time on the court matter more than they might in other evaluations.
To standardize between four metrics that operate on drastically different scales, we found the z-scores in each category and summed them to find a player's total score. Those cumulative z-scores are all that matter for these selections, which focus entirely and exclusively on work during the last two go-rounds.
From there, the calculation is easy. Subtract the 2016-17 score from the one earned during the 2017-18 campaign, and you have improvement. The higher the number, the better.  

2016-17 Per-Game Stats: 6.6 points, 2.8 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 0.4 steals, 0.2 blocks
2016-17 Player Score: minus-2.66 (No. 406 among 486 players)
2017-18 Per-Game Stats: 14.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.0 steals, 0.4 blocks
2017-18 Player Score: 2.02 (No. 96 among 531 players)
Though Jaylen Brown hasn't made the leap to full-fledged stardom for the Boston Celtics, he appears well on his way. The young wing has become a two-way standout, capable of playing intense, physical defense on one side before knocking down a spot-up three in spite of a heavy contest. 
It's that shooting that has allowed for the largest strides. 
No one should deny that Brown's defensive versatility has improved substantially, unlocking easier rotations and alignments for head coach Brad Stevens. Without the second-year player's malleable nature on the outside, Al Horford wouldn't look quite so dominant defending the interior—just one of many examples highlighting Brown's point-preventing efficacy.
But that still pales in comparison to his growing offensive game. 
As a rookie out of California, he shot 45.4 percent from the field, 34.1 percent from downtown and 68.5 percent from the stripe. His slash line has only swelled to 45.9/38.0/64.6, but that middle number has grown while he takes an additional 2.6 triples per game.
The 21-year-old has become a volume sniper who rarely shows any hesitation when pulling up on the perimeter, and defenses have been forced to respect his shot-happy nature. 
Next 10 Up: LaMarcus Aldridge, Kyle Anderson, Darren Collison, Spencer Dinwiddie, Derrick Favors, Brandon Ingram, Khris Middleton, Dejounte Murray, Josh Richardson, Pascal Siakam

2016-17 Per-Game Stats: 20.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.9 steals, 2.5 blocks

Joel Embiid has improved across the board, even if he was already working with a lofty starting point after his spectacular rookie campaign. 
He's traded in blocks for more fundamental defense at the heart of the Philadelphia 76ers' schemes, which has forced opponents to stop probing the painted area when he's patrolling his domain. He's become a more consistent scoring force, though we should note that his three-point accuracy needs to trend back up moving forward. He's more adept on the glass. He even stayed healthy—before suffering an unfortunate orbital fracture in a fluke collision with teammate Markelle Fultz—playing in back-to-backs and nearly tripling his total number of minutes spent on the hardwood. 
But the two key areas of growth involved Embiid's two largest weaknesses: fouling and turning the ball over. 
During the 2016-17 season, he coughed up the rock 5.4 times per 36 minutes and forced the referees into blowing their whistles 5.1 times during the same average span. Per Cleaning the Glass, he sat in the 41st percentile for foul percentage and the 11th percentile for turnover percentage.  
This year, he's up to the 58th and 32nd percentiles, respectively. The per-36-minute numbers, meanwhile, are down to 4.4 and 3.9. That's a set of massive strides in the right direction, though the NBA should be scared that this vastly improved second-year big still has so much room for further refinement. 

2016-17 Per-Game Stats: 5.9 points, 3.6 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.4 blocks
2016-17 Player Score: minus-3.63 (No. 465)
2017-18 Per-Game Stats: 11.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.4 blocks

This isn't meant to pick on any specific writer, since a plethora of media members (myself included) gave the Indiana Pacers poor marks for their seemingly inexplicable decision to trade Paul George for ""only"" Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. But let's isolate what ESPN.com's Kevin Pelton penned about the latter prospect sent back in exchange for the established stud: 
""Sabonis was ineffective as a rookie. In fact, his 3.3 wins worse than replacement level by my WARP metric were the league's third-lowest total, ahead of only fellow rookies Brandon Ingram and Isaiah Whitehead.
""It's possible Sabonis was miscast in a Thunder starting lineup short on 3-point shooting. Sabonis operated as something of a stretch-4 and rarely ventured inside, attempting just two free throws in the season's first 26 games (all starts). After a strong month of November, Sabonis shot just 29-of-110 (26.3 percent) from beyond the arc the remainder of the season.
""Playing alongside stretch-5 Myles Turner may afford Sabonis more ability to play down low, where he was effective at Gonzaga. But Sabonis is heavily reliant on his left hand, which caused problems when defenders read the scouting report. He shot just 38.5 percent on post-up plays, per Synergy Sports tracking, and wasn't particularly effective in the pick-and-roll. Even the most optimistic assessment must concede Sabonis isn't as valuable as he looked when he was drafted No. 11 overall a year ago.""
Then, everything changed. 
Sabonis drew 2.2 more free-throw attempts per game despite receiving only a slight uptick in minutes. He hit 52.8 percent of his two-pointers after connecting on just 43.8 percent as a rookie. He stopped relying on triples and played to his strengths. He improved from 0.65 points per post-up possession (10.5 percentile) to 0.87 (51.7 percentile).
The aforementioned ""everything"" really shouldn't be viewed as hyperbole. Not for a 21-year-old big man who now looks far more like a rotation stalwart than a draft-day bust whose skill set couldn't translate to the sport's highest level. 

2016-17 Per-Game Stats: 2.7 points, 1.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.1 blocks
2016-17 Player Score: minus-2.34 (No. 368)
2017-18 Per-Game Stats: 7.1 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 0.7 steals, 0.2 blocks

If the Washington Wizards had lost John Wall to a long-term injury during the 2016-17 campaign, they would've been doomed. Tomas Satoransky, then a 25-year-old rookie, was in no way ready to take the reins and help his squad continue to produce on the offensive end. His 6'7"" size allowed him to hold his own defensively, but the shooting stroke and passing chops just weren't there. 
Fast-forward to the present, and this sophomore floor general has proved he's ready to handle that exact scenario. 
From the time Wall underwent an arthroscopic knee procedure after a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Jan. 25 to his return on the final day of March, Satoransky averaged 10.3 points, 4.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.1 steals and 0.4 blocks while shooting 53.5 percent from the field, 52.8 percent from downtown and 90.0 percent at the stripe. His whole game developed into a cohesive package, allowing him to torment defenses on the interior with his size while also keeping adversaries honest with a more consistent shooting stroke. 
In fact, the Wizards have been outscored by 0.2 points per 100 possessions with the oversized 1-guard on the bench, but that net rating soars to 3.0 when he plays. He's more than just a backup, and that simply wasn't true last year. 

2016-17 Per-Game Stats: 2.9 points, 1.1 rebounds, 0.9 assists, 0.4 steals, 0.1 blocks

After signing with the Toronto Raptors as an undrafted free agent for the 2016-17 season, rookie point guard Fred VanVleet played just nine minutes in ""clutch"" situations—defined by NBA.com as action occurring within the last five minutes of a game featuring a margin no greater than five points. Only Delon Wright and Pascal Siakam saw less relevant run for the franchise. 
This year, the narrative has flipped 180 degrees.
""It's very difficult [to sit him],"" head coach Dwane Casey said about the sophomore point guard after he played a big part in a come-from-behind December win over the Memphis Grizzlies (h/t William Lou). ""His toughness, his mental toughness, his ability to shoot the ball, diving on the floor, his defense, he brings so much to the table. He doesn't get rattled, he is a mature young man.""
VanVleet has played 93 ""clutch"" minutes this year—a total that leaves him trailing only DeMar DeRozan (150), Kyle Lowry (129) and Serge Ibaka (112) throughout the entire Canadian roster. Casey consistently counts on him to knock down big jumpers, continue asserting himself defensively and avoid making mistakes.
As he should.
After all, VanVleet has improved throughout all 48 minutes. It's just that those late-game scenarios serve as the perfect manifestation of the increased trust he's earned with his all-around play. 

2016-17 Per-Game Stats: 10.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 0.9 steals, 0.2 blocks

Tyreke Evans' stock had been stuck in a downward spiral since he won Rookie of the Year back in 2009-10, and last season's efforts proved no exception. He struggled with his shot immensely while wearing a New Orleans Pelicans uniform, then a midseason trade sent him to the Sacramento Kings, where he'd discover a three-point stroke but fail to carve out a sizable role in his 14 appearances. 
The swingman could muster only a one-year deal worth $3.3 million to join the Memphis Grizzlies this past offseason, but that now looks like one of the league's biggest bargains—injuries and personal issues limiting him to just 52 games notwithstanding. 
Evans has proved his late-season growth from beyond the arc was no fluke, connecting on 39.9 percent of his deep attempts while lofting 5.5 treys per outing (both career highs). And with defenders now forced to respect his perimeter game, he's used his size and physicality advantageously with relentless assaults on the basket, where he can either finish at the rim or use a creative arsenal of close-range strategies.
He's become an offensive wrecking ball, especially when his scoring is paired with his superlative passing vision and knack for keeping his turnovers in check. 
During the 2016-17 campaign, Evans finished with a score of minus-11.14 in NBA Math's offensive points added. This time around, he's at 142.67, which is the No. 20 mark throughout the league and rather easily the top mark on the Memphis roster. In fact, MarShon Brooks (12.55), Mike Conley (8.83) and Chandler Parsons (4.09), all of whom have received limited run for various reasons, have the squad's only other positive scores.

Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge can take a deep breath and relax. 
For a while now, it's seemed like the man in charge viewed Terry Rozier as some sort of untouchable piece. He wasn't going to be moved in a deal for Jimmy Butler, Paul George or anyone else, given his monumental upside at such an important position. And now, he's justifying that faith with substantial improvement and useful production. 
""His energy, how hard he plays on both ends. All I do is watch games, and I think his energy is contagious,"" Chris Paul told ESPN.com's Chris Forsberg about Rozier's game in March. ""While he's not the guy for them, he's important to everything they do.""
The young point guard still isn't perfect. He has to get better at finishing in the restricted area and show more willingness to involve his teammates when running the show as a primary floor general. But that doesn't negate the progress he's already made. 
As a rookie in 2015-16, Rozier scored 8.3 points per 36 minutes with a 32.6 true shooting percentage. Those numbers elevated to 11.7 and 44.6 last year. This season, he's putting up 16.1 points per 36 minutes with a 52.9 true shooting percentage, and he's made those enhancements to his scoring game while also growing as a more disciplined defender. 
He's come a long way since Boston made him the No. 16 pick of the 2015 NBA draft, and he's now a two-way asset for one of the Eastern Conference's legitimate contenders.

Andre Drummond is a perfect example of a standout going from good to great with across-the-board growth, but allow us to focus on just two parts of his widespread improvement. We can save the post-up touch, rebounding excellence (who would have thought more boards were even possible?) and defensive discipline for another time. 
Throughout Drummond's professional career, he was a significant liability at the free-throw stripe, to the point that his struggles curtailed his around-the-basket aggression and made it more difficult to justify playing him in late-game situations. But after topping out at 41.8 percent as a sophomore and finishing 2016-17 at a 38.6 percent clip, the big man finally figured it out. 
Shooting 61.8 percent from the line is by no means a noteworthy accomplishment for most players, but Drummond hasn't been ""most players"" in this vulnerable spot. That's a massive gain, and it frees him up to attack the basket feverishly, making more of the athletic interior plays for which he's known. It's no coincidence he's also taking 0.7 more freebies per game than last year. 
And yet, Drummond's improvement as a passer might be even more notable. 
All of a sudden, head coach Stan Van Gundy is allowing him to handle the ball at the top of the key and create for his teammates—something that admittedly hasn't happened quite as frequently since Blake Griffin came aboard via a midseason trade. Drummond is squeezing the rock into tight spaces and leading the charge on the occasional transition opportunity. Not only has he nearly tripled his previous best (1.1 in 2016-17) by averaging three dimes per contest, but all 18 of his career performances with at least five assists have come during the current campaign.

Dario Saric gets credit for extensive development, given his usefulness as a secondary distributor and improved defensive chops. He's fit in with the Philadelphia 76ers' switch-heavy schemes in seamless fashion, negating any individual woes he might experience by playing solid team defense. 
But all that pales in comparison to his maturity as a scorer. 
During his rookie season, the Croatian forward averaged 17.6 points per 36 minutes while shooting 41.1 percent from the field, 31.1 percent from downtown and 78.2 percent at the stripe. He fired away early and often, but his 50.8 true shooting percentage was so far below the league average that his volume-scoring efforts were detrimental to the Philadelphia cause. 
Not anymore. 
Saric was one of 74 qualified players to post at least 17 points per 36 minutes with a true shooting percentage north of 50 as a rookie, though he ranked dead last among that group in win shares. During his sophomore campaign, he's been one of just 26 qualified contributors to hit the 17 and 58 benchmarks—the product of knocking down 45.5 percent of his field-goal attempts, 39.9 percent of his deep hoists and 86.8 percent of his freebies. Among that class, only 14 men have earned more win shares.
The 23-year-old doesn't seem to be getting much love as a Most Improved Player candidate, and that's largely because his per-game numbers have stagnated. But don't let that dissuade you from thinking he's improved, because the underlying metrics have all skyrocketed.

""My offensive skills came late. In order for me to play, I had to defend at a high level. I want to be a guy who's great on both ends. It's not easy, obviously, but I'm built for it,"" Victor Oladipo recently revealed about his skill set, per IndyStar.com's Clifton Brown. 
The breakout shooting guard was a solid contributor during his brief tenure with the Oklahoma City Thunder, but he was just a shadow of the bona fide star he'd become following a trade to the Indiana Pacers. General manager Kevin Pritchard, much to the chagrin of those who doubted his decision-making this summer, was correct to make him the returning centerpiece of the Paul George transaction. 
Oladipo still defends ""at a high level,"" and that hasn't prevented him from becoming one of the Association's deadliest offensive threats, capable of producing points as an off-ball slasher while also creating his own looks with aplomb. The massive per-game increases aren't the product of prolonged playing time, so much as legitimate strides that have left this former Hoosier as the unquestioned leader of the Indiana offense. 
Players simply aren't supposed to make this type of scoring and distribution ascension while upping every element of their slash line. They're certainly not supposed to do that and make the transition from average defender to suffocating ace taking on tough nightly wing assignments. 
But here we are, and Oladipo's ability to check all those boxes facilitates his running away with the No. 1 spot to such an extent that the gap between his score and that of No. 2 Dario Saric (2.09) is larger than the chasm between Saric and No. 25 Trey Burke (1.99).
If he's a lock for Most Improved Player, that's only because he should be.

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. — His finger traces the path of the bullet that should've killed him on site. Right here, he points. Right here, one bullet struck him near his right temple, traveled through his head and exited just above the eyebrow. 
His skull shattered. Shards of bone fell into his lap, blood gushed, and a car screeched away. The shooters used hollow-point bullets, he explains, bullets designed to expand and destroy and kill on impact.
Thirty hit the SUV in all. Eleven struck his cousin. Two struck Stedman Bailey in the head.
""A barrage,"" Bailey says, ""of bullets.""
That night, Nov. 24, 2015, the then-St. Louis Rams receiver was going to eat dinner with his cousin Antwan Reeves, Antwan's 10-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter, and one of Bailey's best friends, Terrance Gourdine. They were in an SUV they'd rented to drive the nine hours from Miami Gardens to Atlanta the next day, to spend Thanksgiving at Bailey's mother's house, waiting in front of Gourdine's house while he changed for dinner.
The back hatch of the SUV was left open, an unknown vehicle pulled up from behind, and around 8:45 p.m., the gunfire commenced.
""Like a war zone,"" Bailey recalls. ""Call of Duty, but you're really there.""
Bailey, in the passenger seat, took those two bullets. Reeves, in the back, felt one bullet rip through his chest, another strike his lower back and another zip through his arm, then lost feeling in his legs and regained enough feeling to leap atop his kids in the back seat and absorb more bullets in the shoulder. Once the assailants sped away, Reeves handed a cellphone to his son and told him to call Mom, to tell her that he and Bailey were shot.
But his son was staring at Bailey. At the literal holes in Bailey's head.
The 10-year-old screamed.
""Sted's dead! Sted's dead!""
Sted, miraculously, is not dead.
He's here, at Lazy Dog Restaurant and Bar, re-enacting the scene in that SUV one moment and ordering a sweet-and-spicy shrimp bowl the next. Three days prior, by phone, Bailey said he didn't want to talk about the shooting. Yet two minutes into meeting up, he relives everything in chilling detail, only pausing when a waitress interrupts.
""I heard the shots,"" he continues, ""But I felt no pain at all.""

Reeves staggered out of the SUV, saw Bailey was out cold—maybe he was dead?—and instinctively balled up a fist to punch him in the chest.
Bailey woke up.
""Cuz!"" Reeves remembers saying. ""You were shot in the head. Don't move. We're going to get you to the hospital.""
Bailey was confused. To see for himself, he reached for the sun visor. Reeves slapped it back up before Bailey could catch a glimpse of the grisly reflection. Even in the state he himself was in, there was no way Reeves was letting Bailey see this. More bone, more cartilage, more blood from Sted's head splintered and scattered onto his lap, and Bailey realized, right then, ""something was real."" Gourdine reappeared in a panic, and Reeves ordered him to ignore all lights, all cops, to get them to the nearest hospital, which further spiked Bailey's fear. Gourdine, he says, was a terrible driver.
As the SUV reached speeds of nearly 100 mph—a cruel ""roller coaster,"" Bailey calls it—Bailey prayed to make it to Jackson North Medical Center alive.
They did. There was no trauma unit. They were transported to a hospital in Aventura, Florida. They survived.
No, Bailey did not technically lose his life that night, but life as an NFL wide receiver with everything in front of him—money, fame, legacy—seemed to end as he knew it. Suddenly, he couldn't speak. Bailey communicated with friends and family by writing everything down. He couldn't eat. Bailey lost 30 pounds in all. His head swelled into the shape of a blimp. Imagine dropping an egg from eye level, his doctor told him. That was your skull. They needed to cut part of his skull in the back to patch the front. The photos from surgery were horrifying.
In one, Bailey saw a flap of his head open ""like a garage,"" exposing his entire brain. In another, one eyeball hung out of its socket by what seemed like about three feet on a stringy substance.
But the worst moment, by far, was when a doctor asked Bailey what his goals in physical therapy were and the Rams receiver wrote on a piece of paper that he wanted to play football again.
Stedman, we don't know if you'll walk again.
But here he is, two-and-a-half years later, attempting the impossible. Bailey perches his legs up on the booth and clasps his hands. What that doctor didn't know, what a neurologist who helped him with a second surgery didn't know, what any NFL team, coach, player or fan who thinks he's borderline insane for even considering playing football again doesn't know, is what serves as Bailey's daily oxygen.
""I have a divine purpose to be here,"" Bailey says. ""You don't just survive those shots and walk around normal.
""I feel like we as people all have specific plans on Earth.""
One centimeter to the left, and he's dead. Or brain-dead. Or affected cognitively…to some degree, at least. But mentally, he stayed sharp. He never stopped cracking jokes (albeit on a notepad) with Geno Smith, Kayvon Webster and others in that hospital room. The only reason Bailey couldn't speak was that the tube shoved down his throat to help him breathe during surgery damaged his vocal cords. He soon walked and soon talked, because the fragments of the bullet shell touched his brain but never pierced it.

This essentially was one massive concussion.
Last October, Bailey had a custom titanium plate inserted into his head, and the comeback became real. All those shooters did was make Bailey believe his sole existence is to inspire you. Inspire millions.
""I'm ready to show the world,"" he says, ""that I can't be stopped.""
The volume of his voice rises above the electric guitar on the speaker system.
""You've seen dudes come back from ACLs, Achilles, broken bones,"" Bailey says. ""I want to be the one to show people that no matter what you go through, you don't have to let other people define who you are as a person, what you can do as a person—and I can show the world anything is possible.
""I know when I step on the field, there's a 100 percent chance I win Comeback Player of the Year. And then I'll get up on the stage and just blow you away with all that I've been through.""
He can't wait to hold that microphone. He knows a lot of inspiring tales have led to that podium…but a dude shot in the head? Unprecedented.
Bailey's personal doctor has cleared him to play, and now he just needs an NFL team to do the same. His fiancee isn't worried. His son isn't worried. Mom isn't worried. Bailey absolutely is not worried.
He sits up straight, leans forward.
He knows exactly why he's still breathing.
""We honestly feel,"" he says, ""like I'm the chosen one to do this.""
Beanie on, hood up, the scar is hidden. It's impossible for anyone at the Sports Academy to tell that this is someone who took two bullets to the head.

That's the way Stedman Bailey likes it.
He wants to blend in with the crowd, so there's zero small talk and zero peeking at the March Madness games on TVs above. For two hours straight, the man is a blur. Bailey churns the battle ropes. Bench-presses. Shoulder-shrugs. Turns facedown on an incline bench to crank out one-arm rows with a 60-pound dumbbell.
Drops to a plank for pushups, and one trainer drops massive metal chains onto his back. Bailey coolly cranks out rep after rep after rep and doesn't say a word as the ringing of chains synchronizes with rap blaring over the speakers. He doesn't cheat, either, nearly kissing the floor.
On to more weights. To snaring footballs whistling out of a JUGS machine at 100 mph. To a heated one-on-one game against NFL linebacker Akeem Ayers in which he drills one stepback J, takes him to the rack for a 6-2 lead and tells Ayers' three-year-old son, ""Pop's getting dug up!"" Oh, Ayers promptly scores six straight points to win and ruthlessly taunts his friend, but Bailey gets a little revenge in the paint during three-on-three.
""You got two of my toes!"" yells Ayers, limping out of bounds.
""Well,"" Bailey says, ""in those soft-ass LeBron shoes…""
Here, Bailey is on a warpath to the NFL. Here, he gives himself a 90 percent chance of signing with a team—""or better.""
Here, it's easy to believe.
The titanium plate is what made this belief possible. When a plastic surgeon first broached the idea of an implant, he thought implants were only for boob jobs. The surgeon explained that this would be custom-fit for his head and that this was ""a game-changer"" if Bailey harbored hopes of playing again. The neurologist who assisted wasn't as optimistic an NFL return was possible, but Bailey was willing to try, so on Oct. 20, the doctors re-opened his scar for a six-hour surgery. Very quickly, he again was hurling around 80-pound dumbbells on the bench press like loaves of bread, working religiously with two-time Olympian Nabie Fofanah (""The Speed Doctor"") and running a blistering 4.43 in the 40 at Marshall's pro day.

That time would've tied for sixth among 37 wide receivers at this year's NFL combine.
It was a reminder for scouts on site of the baller Bailey was—the one who exploded for 1,622 yards and 25 scores on 114 receptions his final season at West Virginia, was drafted in the third round in 2013 and totaled 843 yards in two-and-a-half years on bad Rams teams.
Yet when Bailey chatted with scouts, they spoke to him like he was an ""experiment.""
Voices softened into a kindergarten teacher-like tone. Eyes widened. They treated him like a moral victory. Part of Bailey understands. Everyone who meets him expects him to be, you know, off.
What he went through, you're constantly looking for how it affected him. He stalls on the sidewalk outside a restaurant to talk and talk and talk, and you ask yourself, Why? Is he waiting for someone to pick him up? His vision had to be affected by his eyeball popping out, right? 
Nope. He can drive. He was simply being friendly. His vision is 20/20.
That's why, mid-one-on-one game, Bailey walks over to say, ""See? Just living a normal life."" He wants to be treated like any other NFL free agent. Sadly, that's impossible. Even if he morphs himself into the strongest, fastest pound-for-pound player in the NFL, it won't change the reality that no other player in the NFL is playing with a plate in his head.
His hopes spiked recently while texting Rams special teams coordinator John ""Bones"" Fassel about a return, and he's sure to flex his biceps for all Rams personnel who drop into this gym.

Teams still may not give a damn that his plate is literally stronger than a human skull or if he ran a 4.2 and caught 100 of 100 passes in a tryout.
He needs a miracle.
But Bailey also knows that he is a miracle.
Sitting on an aluminum bench after this workout, it hits him: Blending in won't cut it. There's a divine reason he's here.
So he doesn't agonize over any conversation with a scout or any time in the 40. No, what Bailey took most from his appearance at the Marshall pro day was the fact that Larry Aaron had died. At 19. He stares ahead in a trance, explaining that for weeks he was trying to get in touch with the Marshall defensive lineman. Like Bailey, Aaron was the victim of a shooting that didn't seem to make any sense. At a New Year's Eve party, while shielding his girlfriend, Aaron was hit by a stray bullet. Unlike Bailey, Aaron was left paralyzed from the waist down and then died on Feb. 22
The two never connected. Bailey learned on campus that Aaron had died.
This hit close to home.
""It's like, 'Damn,'"" Bailey says. ""I think he only took one bullet and here he is. He passed away. Anything could have went differently for me that night.""
There's a reason everyone in that SUV survived. Bailey still thinks back to Nov. 24, 2015, and cries tears of joy because even after arriving at Jackson North, things could've gone south.
Reeves was so convinced he was going to die, he left his two kids with a security guard he recognized from 20 years ago and says he started praying to God to forgive him for any sins.
Medics said he only had seven minutes to live and that getting to Aventura's trauma unit via helicopter would take 15 minutes. Which is precisely when someone—to this day, Reeves has no clue who—said he could get Reeves to Aventura in five minutes.
Reeves was bleeding so much that one medic slipped and fell on his blood while loading him into the ambulance.
""Either I was going to die right there in the lobby,"" Reeves says, ""or he was going to save me. … Do you think angels walk the earth? They do. Listen. Trust me.""
Reeves got his blood transfusion in time, spent a day in a coma and survived with one bullet still lodged in his spine.
Meanwhile, in a different ambulance, Bailey nearly dozed off for a nap. If medics hadn't shouted, ""Stay awake! Stay awake!"" he's not so sure he'd be here, either. Further, Bailey has no clue what transpired between that ambulance ride and surgery the next morning.
""Where the f--k was I?"" Bailey says. ""Was I just in the room or something? Dead?""
Adds Reeves: ""Listen, I saw a hole in his head. I could look through his head. It was like something that wasn't real. It was like Hollywood.""
There's also a reason he was in Miami to begin with. Bailey was serving a suspension for smoking marijuana and couldn't be around his team in St. Louis. So he was home. So he was shot. Bailey should connect these cruel dots and hold a bitter grudge against the league for punishing players for an act now legal in several states. Or for the rule banning suspended players from the facility. Instead, Bailey repeats on five different occasions that he needed to mature. Needed a wake-up call.
There's a reason he never felt pain. Even in the days, weeks, months after the shooting, Bailey never suffered a blip of PTSD. Unlike Reeves, who kept a gun under his pillow at night and brought it with him to the gas station, to the front porch, to buy a bag of chips, everywhere. And unlike Reeves' kids, who underwent therapy, who were scared every time they stopped at a red light.
There's a reason the shooters picked him. Reeves and Bailey both believe this was gang-related—maybe part of an initiation. The local detective on the case did not return calls from Bleacher Report, but Reeves says a federal investigation is ongoing and that he's heard about a high possibility of ""mistaken identity.""
There must, Bailey repeats with authority, be a reason for all of this.
So he trains on. One marking on his body—unlike the scar beneath that beanie—is displayed for all to see. Bailey holds out his left forearm to show his third tattoo of Jesus Christ. He got this one yesterday before dinner in Long Beach. Jesus is outstretched on the cross, bleeding—and see where it's unfinished near Bailey's wrist? When this tat is done, Jesus' arm will blend into Bailey's arm. They'll be one and the same.
""Just turn my test,"" he says, ""into a testimony to inspire others.""
Does he seek vengeance on his enemies? ""Hell yeah,"" there are days Bailey wants a piece of the people who tried to kill him. But whenever those impulses surface, he can take a look at this crucifix and remember why he's here.

This is where he finds peace and allows himself to dream.
Nearly 3,000 miles away from the shooting.
In Malibu, off the Pacific Coast Highway, near Point Mugu State Park, is a small beach hardly anyone knows about. At least once a week, Bailey and his four-month-old German shepherd, ""King,"" walk to the tip of this beach, to the rocks, and find a safe place to sit, and Bailey stares off at the ocean. Gospel music in his earbuds, he can think, he can cry, he can meditate and be, Bailey says with a laugh, as ""weird"" as he wants. A close friend who's based in a military camp about 20 minutes away told Bailey about this spot. This is where he's able to reflect on the miracle past and envision the miracle future.
""It's so peaceful,"" he says. ""It's beautiful.""
This day, waves crash with thunderous force underneath a sky split into an eerie canvas of what appears to be two completely different worlds. To the left is a blue sky. Tranquil, gorgeous. To the right is a dark sky. Apocalyptic, haunting. As Bailey walks King—King twirling around on his leash in a restless 360—he thinks aloud of the friends he's lost. He never was in the streets himself, but Bailey admits some of his friends were ""around certain stuff,"" so those friends needed to be eliminated from his life. Friends who aren't living the way he's living now or don't believe he can complete this comeback.
""I don't mess with people like that,"" Bailey says. ""I keep people around who are positive.""
And then the night of Nov. 24, 2015 briefly flashes in the form of a nightmare. He recalls a few people in the streets telling him that maybe this was no accident, that maybe he was set up. It visibly bothers him that nobody spoke up to police, too. He gets it: Snitching carries consequences, but someone close to Bailey could've steered detectives in the right direction. Bailey feels himself starting to fade…and fade…into that darkness until one sight near the water instantly snaps him out of it.
A harbor seal pup has washed ashore. Nearby, a marine biologist is keeping an eye on the baby as it waits for its mother to return with food. Bailey, a Planet Earth buff, is fascinated and asks the biologist a string of questions before gliding on toward the rocks, back in the right state of mind.
Yes, he could have exacted revenge. He could've applied pressure on people he knows in the streets. Bailey says he wasn't in gangs. But he assures he has the ""street cred"" to get answers because he's respected. And make no mistake: Bailey feels those urges. Part of him needs to know who tried to kill him. Who wouldn't want revenge on someone who tried to kill them? The anger alone should have Bailey buying a one-way ticket to Miami. But he lets it go. He didn't want to end up in jail himself. Not with a fiancee. Not with a son.

""Whoever those dudes were,"" he says, ""they'll get theirs.""
He stares off into that sky—toward the light—and finally rips off that beanie. The scar is revealed, and it stretches from ear to ear. Turns out, Bailey doesn't hide from this at all. He embraces it. He even shaved his head so the scar would be more pronounced. A giant wave nearly douses Bailey, and he doesn't flinch. No, his adrenaline is pumping now.

He hopes the shooters are reading this story, and he hopes they tune in on Sundays this fall.
""Revenge is killing them with success,"" Bailey says. ""You all thought you had me? I'm coming back stronger. So, hey, thank you.
""Here I am.""
The dream Bailey imagines this day is his first touchdown back. He'll rip off his helmet, find the nearest camera and point to that scar.
He'll stare his shooters in the face, sure, but he'll also be your inspiration.
""I'm taking my helmet off so everybody can see,"" Bailey says. ""Helmet. Off.""
With those words, the rain picks up. It's pouring now. Bailey repeats he cannot be stopped and says he'll write a book one day. Maybe call it Man of Steel. The doctor who cleared him for football even joked that the plate is so strong, Bailey could take another bullet. To which Bailey laughed back: ""No! No! No! We don't wanna do that!"" And again, he cannot fathom how he took two bullets to the head and never felt a thing.
When people ask, ""What did that feel like?"" he never has an answer.
He only knows this: There's no reason to let any negativity clog this mind when the mind, he says, ""is a powerful thing."" So in the parking lot, before driving away, he turns the conversation to a more positive topic, breaking down his marriage proposal (""Smooth, real smooth"") in riveting play-by-play. Then he pictures one more scene, one more dream.
He's in an NFL locker room. He's giving the pregame speech. He's making every player in the room want to run through a damn wall. 
""The attitude I have,"" Bailey says, ""I would think teams would want me around other guys and help motivate them. I can look at guys now and say: 'Listen, man. The s--t's not hard. I've been shot before. Let's go out here and go get it.' Motivation to where people say: 'You know what, he's f--king right. What can't I do?'""
Until that call comes, however, he only has this.
A beach. An ocean. And dreams.
Dreams that are not yet reality.
Twelve hours later, Bailey stands alone near two weighted sleds at the Sports Academy. There are six 45-pound plates on each one.
He scans the room and yells to no one in particular:
""Get on one of these sleds with me! I need motivation!""
Bailey succeeds in making eye contact with Todd Gurley, shouts, ""I was born ready!"" and Gurley barks back, ""Born ready?"" With that, Bailey muscles this sled 20 yards downfield, turns it around, drives it back and proceeds to compete against himself all morning, from clearing hurdles off of two feet to one-legged bounds that accelerate into a sprint to one-legged deadlifts as Nipsey Hussle’s ""Last Time That I Checc'd"" blares. He bobs his head to the lyrics—Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck/It was no smut on my rep—and again does battle with Ayers and Gurley on the basketball court.

Gurley, the reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year, has a tangible reason to be here. He'll anchor a potential Super Bowl contender. Bailey can only train and train and pray he gets a chance to play the most ruthless sport on Earth with a plate in his head. Millions may be inspired, he's told, but millions will also think he's nuts for even trying this.
For the first—and only—time all week, Bailey gets…testy.
""There's going to be doubters. There's going to be haters. That comes with life,"" Bailey says. ""I'd just tell them: 'Man, you have these doubts. Say what you want. Look at what I've been through. What has stopped me yet?'""
He lets those words hang in the air.
""Crickets. I'm going to keep going, no matter what. No human can tell me, 'You can't do this.'""
Moments later, he calls over NFL safety Maurice Alexander to rehearse his touchdown celebration. Alexander thinks he should crouch low and cross his arms. No, no, that's not it. Bailey pops to his feet and says it needs to be more elaborate than that. He'll arch his back, like so, and strut in a straight line before ripping his helmet off for the camera. ""For like five minutes!"" he says. ""The feeling is going to be phenomenal. They'll be saying, 'Oh, this guy really lost his mind!'""
Bailey rattles off other players who'll be up for Comeback Player of the Year. Odell Beckham Jr. broke his ankle, and J.J. Watt broke his leg, but we've seen players bounce back from all that before.
""Shot in the head?"" he says. ""Nobody would be living to sit here and talk to you. … I want to make history.""
He loves football, sure, but this is bigger than some blind allegiance to the sport. Bailey believes that if he signs with a team, if he scores that touchdown, if he looks into that camera, if he grabs that mic, he will change how millions of people approach every ounce of adversity in their lives. Life ""can be a bitch,"" he says. But what excuses will anyone be able to spew about anything once they've seen a dude on a football field who was shot twice in the head? He says he'll make you maximize ""your 24 hours"" in a way unimagined. You're down? You're out? Keep Going.
""I want to motivate people around the world,"" Bailey says. ""There's a reason I'm alive.
""This is a movement.""
Bailey then pops back to his feet and cannot stop moving while dropping more revelations, one after the other.
The hundreds of messages from strangers on Instagram. He reads them all.
The death of his grandmother. That hurt.
The fact that his dad's been in prison his whole life for ""making millions"" as a big-time drug dealer. Bailey didn't even meet his father until he was 18 but says there's now a chance the judge who delivered the sentence will re-open the case. Sted needs to be his shining light. It'll be tough for Dad to re-assimilate.
""But your son being the chosen one..."" he says, letting his voice trail off.
""Your youngest son can show you how it's done the right way. The positive way.""

He keeps repeating the two words: Keep Going. He sees millions repeating them one day—at a ""Just Do It"" clip—hopefully while sporting the clothing line Bailey has been wearing all week, ""Positive Energee,"" which he created after the shooting.
Bailey rubs his hands together, gives the Sports Academy a panoramic view and vows to build a facility exactly like this back in his drug- and gang- and crime-infested Miami neighborhood. He'll go right back to the scene of the crime, where he was shot, and save lives because so many kids there remind Bailey of himself.
He can't let them catch two bullets in the head.
If they do, they won't be as lucky as he is.
He keeps circling, keeps thinking, keeps nodding his head, and now there's no doubt. This movement is too powerful to fail.
Sted isn't dead, no.
He's just beginning.",sports

The San Jose Sharks and Minnesota Wild each clinched a berth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Monday. 
San Jose (44-25-10) clinched when the Colorado Avalanche lost 3-1 at the Los Angeles Kings. The Sharks, who are two points ahead of the Kings for second place in the Pacific Division, did not play Monday. 
The Sharks are back in the playoffs despite losing key forwards Patrick Marleau, who signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs as a free agent July 2 after 19 seasons with San Jose, and Joe Thornton, who sustained a knee injury Jan. 23.
""Those guys have led the way and established something,"" Sharks captain Joe Pavelski said. ""[We] try to keep that going and keep passing it on.… We always look up to those guys in a lot of ways. You don't replace that. You don't push that aside."" 
San Jose, which has made the playoffs in 13 of 14 seasons, lost to the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference First Round last season after reaching the 2016 Stanley Cup Final.

Minnesota (44-25-10), which defeated the Edmonton Oilers 3-0 on Monday, clinched when Colorado lost. The Wild are in third place in the Central Division, five points ahead of the Avalanche.
The Wild will enter the playoffs without defenseman Ryan Suter, who will have surgery and is out for the season after he broke his right ankle during a 4-1 loss to the Dallas Stars on Saturday.

Suter ranks second in the NHL with an average of 26:46 of ice time per game, behind Drew Doughty of the Los Angeles Kings (26:47).
This will be the Wild's sixth straight playoff appearance. They lost in the first round the past two seasons.
""It's going to be just as important to build our game going into the playoffs, so it's not like you're going to taking any sort of break regardless of what happens,"" Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk said.

Vancouver Canucks stars Daniel and Henrik Sedin announced in a letter to Canucks fans on NHL.com on Monday that they would be retiring following the 2017-18 season.
Below is an excerpt from that letter:      
""We started the year with the mindset that a decision would be made in the postseason. But it became clear, after discussions with our families throughout the year, that this will be our last season. This feels right for all of us.
""Being part of the Canucks family for 18 seasons has been the best period of our lives. But it's time to focus on our families and life after hockey. It's time to help with homework every night. It's time to be at every birthday party and to stand in the cold at every hockey rink, soccer game and riding lesson on weekends. It's time to be at home for dinner every night.
""We're saying it now because we want to share these final three games with you. We also want to share these games with our families, friends, teammates, coaches, trainers, staff and everyone at the Canucks who have supported us. You've all been with us every step of the way, and we want to thank you.""
The Canucks' playoff hopes ended March 14 with a loss to the Anaheim Ducks. The team is sitting at just 69 points, second-worst in the Western Conference. It will be the organization's third straight season without a postseason berth after it reached the playoffs in 11 of the 14 prior campaigns.
That string of consistency was due in large part to the Sedin twins, who formed one of the NHL's most fearsome top lines in their primes. Daniel was the sniper, notching 20 or more goals 11 times in his career. Henrik was the playmaker, with at least 50 assists in a season eight times. He also won the 2009-10 Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP.
Henrik is sixth among active players with 1,068 points, while Daniel is seventh with 1,038 points. 
The pair didn't win a Stanley Cup, as their lone Final appearance in 2011 ended with a loss to the Boston Bruins in seven games, but they did lead Sweden to an Olympic gold in the 2006 Winter Games in Torino, Italy.",sports

Steven Stamkos is day to day with a lower-body injury for the Tampa Bay Lightning, and coach Jon Cooper said he's questionable for their game at the Boston Bruins on Tuesday (7:30 p.m. ET; NBCSN, TVAS, SN1, NESN, NHL.TV).
The 28-year-old center left a 4-1 loss to the Nashville Predators on Sunday at 3:25 of the second period after getting tangled up with Predators forward Austin Watson. The Lightning, who have three games left in the regular season, could rest Stamkos until the Stanley Cup Playoffs begin April 11.
""Do I consider that? Yes, I guess we could consider that,"" Cooper said. ""The player knows his body. The doctors know what to do. I'm not going to speculate on anything. [Stamkos] is planning on playing in the playoffs and I'm pretty sure he is planning on playing some point in one of these last three games. But it's medical personnel. They'll make the decision and [Stamkos], based on how he feels, will make the decision.
""He's been getting nicked up here the last little while. So, if there's a time to sit back and say, 'OK, this is the time to rest,' we need him feeling his best in a week and a half from now and not necessarily right now.""
Video: Discussing the lower-body injury to Steven Stamkos 
Stamkos missed a 4-1 loss to the Arizona Coyotes on March 26 with a lower-body injury, the first game he missed this season. He returned for the next three games, a 4-2 loss to the Bruins on Thursday, a 7-3 win against the New York Rangers on Friday and the loss to the Predators. He was not on the ice at practice Monday.
The Lightning (52-23-4) have clinched a playoff berth. They trail the Bruins by two points for first place in the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference. Boston has played one fewer game.
""It's probably going to have a big determination of who comes first,"" Cooper said of the game Tuesday. ""Let's be honest, we win the game and we're right back at it. They win the game and they've probably got it. In the big scope of things, it's game 80 but it's a big game 80.""
Stamkos missed the Lightning's final 65 games last season because of a torn lateral meniscus in his right knee that required surgery. He has rebounded with 86 points (27 goals, 59 assists) this season, the most he's had since 2011-12, when he had 97, including 60 goals.
""One of the best players on the team,"" Lightning forward Alex Killorn said. ""He'll be back, he's a competitive guy. We just want to make sure he's healthy. We need him in the lineup. Power play, first-line center. He's huge for us. We need him.""

        ""articleBody"": ""At first, the drama played out beyond the field. The display for the radar gun at Chase Field resides on a screen in the right-field seats, above an advertisement for a bar and below the plaques commemorating the two retired numbers in Arizona Diamondbacks history. On Monday evening, as the Dodgers protected a three-run lead, the pixelated digits carried more weight than usual.The gun tracked the speed of Kenley Jansen&#039;s cut fastball: 90 mph . . . 88 mph . . . 89 . . . 92 . . . 91. A pitcher of Jansen&#039;s pedigree rarely receives such scrutiny. But those were the consequences after his first outing of the season, in which his velocity averaged 89.6 mph and he shrugged off questions in search of explanation.Jansen received two days off after his 2018 debut. He spent them cleaning up his delivery to regenerate the velocity he once produced, a steady stream of 93-mph cutters. In his second outing of the season, Jansen managed to improve his velocity. Except as the focus on the radar gun intensified, Jansen immolated on the mound in a game the Dodgers eventually lost, 8-7, in 15 innings.The ending added to the frustration. A two-out single by Chase Utley brought home Cody Bellinger in the 15th. Asked to protect the lead was Wilmer Font, who was pitching his fifth inning. He gave up a game-tying double to shortstop Nick Ahmed and a walkoff single to Jeff Mathis.The defeat stung. The performance by Jansen was more troubling.&#034;Just didn&#039;t execute,&#034; manager Dave Roberts said.After issuing consecutive walks with two outs, Jansen served up a 90.5-mph cutter to outfielder Chris Owings. The location was &#034;in his nitro zone,&#034; Roberts said. The ball landed deep in the left-field seats, a three-run blast that tied the score 6-6 and ruined an otherwise sterling outing from the Dodgers bullpen, which pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings after a brief outing by Hyun-Jin Ryu. Jansen could not protect the advantage.Jansen hung his head as he walked off the field. He looked off-kilter throughout the outing. The velocity looked better. His delivery did not. His command wavered as he heaved himself toward the plate. Inside the dugout, he rubbed his right shoulder as the Dodgers played past midnight, a five-hour, 45-minute affair that was the longest game in Chase Field history.Perhaps Jansen requires more tinkering with his mechanics. Perhaps he is still plagued by the hamstring issues that slowed his spring training. Perhaps he needed a heavier workload this spring, when the Dodgers used him sparingly. Or perhaps this is an inevitable outcome for a 30-year-old pitcher who has averaged 66 regular-season appearances since 2012 and has pitched into October every season since 2013.Both Jansen and Roberts insisted the pitcher was healthy. Jansen admitted he was &#034;fighting with some stuff&#034; mechanically. But he said his body was not bothering him.&#034;I&#039;m fine,&#034; Jansen said.Added Roberts, &#034;From everything I understand, he is 100% healthy.&#034;The explanation will appear in time. Until then, the Dodgers know this: Jansen has pitched twice this season. He lost the first game. In his second, he matched his total of blown saves from 2017. He has given up two homers in two games; he gave up five in 2018. He is the foundation of the team&#039;s bullpen, and he has been the least reliable pitcher of the group in this minuscule sample size.&#034;It sucks,&#034; Jansen said. &#034;A slow start. But nobody is going to feel sorry for me.&#034;To start a night when he reached base five times, Yasmani Grandal launched a first-inning blast to cap a three-run blitz of Diamondbacks starter Taijuan Walker. Struggling to throw strikes, Ryu coughed up the lead over 3 2/3 innings. A solo shot by Logan Forsythe gave the Dodgers the lead in the sixth. Grandal cracked a two-out double in the seventh and scored on a single by Cody Bellinger for insurance. An inning later, Joc Pederson contributed a two-out run-scoring single.The Dodgers faced Walker for the first time since pummeling him in October. Walker started Game 1 of a National League division series. He lasted precisely one inning, giving up four runs before exiting the premises.Walker did better Monday. He cleared a low bar. He still gave up three runs.The first man up for the Dodgers was an unlikely choice. Roberts selected Pederson as his leadoff hitter. With Chris Taylor getting a day off, Roberts opted for Pederson to replace him, despite no hits in his first six at-bats. The cold streak ended against Walker.Pederson stung a full-count fastball for a double. Two pitches later, Corey Seager pulled a fastball into right field for a run-scoring single. Seager was still at first when Grandal came to the plate. Walker fell behind in the count and fed Grandal a two-seam fastball down the middle. Grandal launched the baseball into the pool area beyond the right-center fence.Walker weathered the early flurries. The lead slipped from Ryu&#039;s grasp inning by inning, as his command of the strike zone wavered.Ryu gave a run back in the first inning. After two speedy outs, Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt blasted a double off the center-field wall. A trio of changeups did not fool outfielder A.J. Pollock. Pollock deposited the third into left for a run-scoring double.The Diamondbacks tested the Dodgers outfield defense in the third. In the first at-bat of the inning, David Peralta lifted a ball into the left-field corner. Matt Kemp took a twisting route toward it. He banged his left leg into the fence as he skidded to a stop. Pederson trotted over to check in on his teammate.Pederson returned to center field. The next ball caught him flat-footed. A drive from second baseman Ketel Marte sailed over Pederson&#039;s head. Marte landed at third base with a one-out triple.Ryu slipped deeper into the muck. He walked Goldschmidt and Owings. With two outs and the bases loaded, Ryu faced third baseman Jake Lamb. In 2017, Lamb hit .144 against left-handed pitchers like Ryu. This time, he didn&#039;t even have to swing. Ryu walked Lamb on four pitches to drive in a second Diamondbacks run.Ryu was still disconnected from the strike zone when the fourth began. He issued his fifth walk to open the frame. Bailed out when Walker grounded into a double play, Ryu could not escape. He gave up a single to Peralta. Marte smoked a hanging curveball for a run-scoring triple. The hit tied the score and ended Ryu&#039;s evening.Walker gave up eight hits and two walks in five innings. But the Dodgers could not score against him after the first. The offense pounced on the arrival of right-handed reliever Yoshihisa Hirano. Forsythe unloaded on a 1-0 fastball in the sixth and homered to center to reclaim the lead for the Dodgers.The Dodgers piled on runs in the seventh and the eighth. The bullpen held the line. They passed the baton to Jansen, who had not pitched since Saturday. His velocity started to increase as he retired the first two batters. Then came Goldschmidt.Goldschmidt worked the count to 2-2. Jansen missed outside with a pair of cutters. Up came Pollock. Again Jansen got ahead in the count. And again he missed outside, the cutters straying from the zone for a free pass. Jansen walked his first batter in 2017 on June 25.&#034;I tried to just go out there and attack,&#034; Jansen said. &#034;It didn&#039;t go my way.&#034;Owings did not take a passive approach. Jansen spun a cutter at the level of Owings&#039; belt. Owings crushed it.The game would not end for another two hours and seven minutes. Font dragged his team past midnight before succumbing in the 15th. The team may need to make a roster move to compensate for the depleted pitching staff. Jansen felt responsible for the mess.&#034;It sucks,&#034; Jansen said. &#034;We lost.&#034;andy.mccullough@latimes.comTwitter: @McCulloughTimes"",

At first, the drama played out beyond the field. The display for the radar gun at Chase Field resides on a screen in the right-field seats, above an advertisement for a bar and below the plaques commemorating the two retired numbers in Arizona Diamondbacks history. On Monday evening, as the Dodgers protected a three-run lead, the pixelated digits carried more weight than usual.
The gun tracked the speed of Kenley Jansen's cut fastball: 90 mph . . . 88 mph . . . 89 . . . 92 . . . 91. A pitcher of Jansen's pedigree rarely receives such scrutiny. But those were the consequences after his first outing of the season, in which his velocity averaged 89.6 mph and he shrugged off questions in search of explanation.
Jansen received two days off after his 2018 debut. He spent them cleaning up his delivery to regenerate the velocity he once produced, a steady stream of 93-mph cutters. In his second outing of the season, Jansen managed to improve his velocity. Except as the focus on the radar gun intensified, Jansen immolated on the mound in a game the Dodgers eventually lost, 8-7, in 15 innings.
The ending added to the frustration. A two-out single by Chase Utley brought home Cody Bellinger in the 15th. Asked to protect the lead was Wilmer Font, who was pitching his fifth inning. He gave up a game-tying double to shortstop Nick Ahmed and a walkoff single to Jeff Mathis.
The defeat stung. The performance by Jansen was more troubling.
""Just didn't execute,"" manager Dave Roberts said.
After issuing consecutive walks with two outs, Jansen served up a 90.5-mph cutter to outfielder Chris Owings. The location was ""in his nitro zone,"" Roberts said. The ball landed deep in the left-field seats, a three-run blast that tied the score 6-6 and ruined an otherwise sterling outing from the Dodgers bullpen, which pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings after a brief outing by Hyun-Jin Ryu. Jansen could not protect the advantage.
Jansen hung his head as he walked off the field. He looked off-kilter throughout the outing. The velocity looked better. His delivery did not. His command wavered as he heaved himself toward the plate. Inside the dugout, he rubbed his right shoulder as the Dodgers played past midnight, a five-hour, 45-minute affair that was the longest game in Chase Field history.
Perhaps Jansen requires more tinkering with his mechanics. Perhaps he is still plagued by the hamstring issues that slowed his spring training. Perhaps he needed a heavier workload this spring, when the Dodgers used him sparingly. Or perhaps this is an inevitable outcome for a 30-year-old pitcher who has averaged 66 regular-season appearances since 2012 and has pitched into October every season since 2013.
Both Jansen and Roberts insisted the pitcher was healthy. Jansen admitted he was ""fighting with some stuff"" mechanically. But he said his body was not bothering him.
""I'm fine,"" Jansen said.
Added Roberts, ""From everything I understand, he is 100% healthy.""
The explanation will appear in time. Until then, the Dodgers know this: Jansen has pitched twice this season. He lost the first game. In his second, he matched his total of blown saves from 2017. He has given up two homers in two games; he gave up five in 2018. He is the foundation of the team's bullpen, and he has been the least reliable pitcher of the group in this minuscule sample size.
""It sucks,"" Jansen said. ""A slow start. But nobody is going to feel sorry for me.""
To start a night when he reached base five times, Yasmani Grandal launched a first-inning blast to cap a three-run blitz of Diamondbacks starter Taijuan Walker. Struggling to throw strikes, Ryu coughed up the lead over 3 2/3 innings. A solo shot by Logan Forsythe gave the Dodgers the lead in the sixth. Grandal cracked a two-out double in the seventh and scored on a single by Cody Bellinger for insurance. An inning later, Joc Pederson contributed a two-out run-scoring single.
The Dodgers faced Walker for the first time since pummeling him in October. Walker started Game 1 of a National League division series. He lasted precisely one inning, giving up four runs before exiting the premises.
Walker did better Monday. He cleared a low bar. He still gave up three runs.
The first man up for the Dodgers was an unlikely choice. Roberts selected Pederson as his leadoff hitter. With Chris Taylor getting a day off, Roberts opted for Pederson to replace him, despite no hits in his first six at-bats. The cold streak ended against Walker.
Pederson stung a full-count fastball for a double. Two pitches later, Corey Seager pulled a fastball into right field for a run-scoring single. Seager was still at first when Grandal came to the plate. Walker fell behind in the count and fed Grandal a two-seam fastball down the middle. Grandal launched the baseball into the pool area beyond the right-center fence.
Walker weathered the early flurries. The lead slipped from Ryu's grasp inning by inning, as his command of the strike zone wavered.
Ryu gave a run back in the first inning. After two speedy outs, Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt blasted a double off the center-field wall. A trio of changeups did not fool outfielder A.J. Pollock. Pollock deposited the third into left for a run-scoring double.
The Diamondbacks tested the Dodgers outfield defense in the third. In the first at-bat of the inning, David Peralta lifted a ball into the left-field corner. Matt Kemp took a twisting route toward it. He banged his left leg into the fence as he skidded to a stop. Pederson trotted over to check in on his teammate.
Pederson returned to center field. The next ball caught him flat-footed. A drive from second baseman Ketel Marte sailed over Pederson's head. Marte landed at third base with a one-out triple.
Ryu slipped deeper into the muck. He walked Goldschmidt and Owings. With two outs and the bases loaded, Ryu faced third baseman Jake Lamb. In 2017, Lamb hit .144 against left-handed pitchers like Ryu. This time, he didn't even have to swing. Ryu walked Lamb on four pitches to drive in a second Diamondbacks run.
Ryu was still disconnected from the strike zone when the fourth began. He issued his fifth walk to open the frame. Bailed out when Walker grounded into a double play, Ryu could not escape. He gave up a single to Peralta. Marte smoked a hanging curveball for a run-scoring triple. The hit tied the score and ended Ryu's evening.
Walker gave up eight hits and two walks in five innings. But the Dodgers could not score against him after the first. The offense pounced on the arrival of right-handed reliever Yoshihisa Hirano. Forsythe unloaded on a 1-0 fastball in the sixth and homered to center to reclaim the lead for the Dodgers.
The Dodgers piled on runs in the seventh and the eighth. The bullpen held the line. They passed the baton to Jansen, who had not pitched since Saturday. His velocity started to increase as he retired the first two batters. Then came Goldschmidt.
Goldschmidt worked the count to 2-2. Jansen missed outside with a pair of cutters. Up came Pollock. Again Jansen got ahead in the count. And again he missed outside, the cutters straying from the zone for a free pass. Jansen walked his first batter in 2017 on June 25.
""I tried to just go out there and attack,"" Jansen said. ""It didn't go my way.""
Owings did not take a passive approach. Jansen spun a cutter at the level of Owings' belt. Owings crushed it.
The game would not end for another two hours and seven minutes. Font dragged his team past midnight before succumbing in the 15th. The team may need to make a roster move to compensate for the depleted pitching staff. Jansen felt responsible for the mess.
""It sucks,"" Jansen said. ""We lost.""

621,"

PHOENIX — Oatmeal nearly gone, bacon in hand and another meeting stuffed with pointed questions behind him, the Apple Watch wrapping Tony Clark's wrist beeped with a message: ""Time to stand.""
The late-morning breakfast conversation here in a booth of the swanky hotel restaurant paused as the Major League Players Association executive director stopped to consider the message. The winter has been difficult, and the spring arguably has been worse. The seal on the latest Basic Agreement between the players and owners barely has been broken—the sides are just 15 months into the four-year contract—and yet free agents this past winter stepped into a deep freeze and, even now, a couple dozen remain unsigned. The agitation level is high.
The message on his watch was a simple reminder to the 6'8"" Clark at various checkpoints throughout his workday. His back, which he first injured playing basketball at the University of Arizona in the early 1990s and then managed throughout a 15-year MLB career spanning from 1995-2009, has been flaring up this spring along with everything else. Though he wears the pain without complaint, you can see it in the stiff way he walks.
Because Clark is a grinder who tends to keep his head down, blinders on and works through what is in front of him until it is finished, he can use every reminder he can get to pause, stand and stretch his tight and aching back.
But here's the thing: As he led meetings with each of the game's 30 clubs throughout his annual tour of Florida and Arizona camps this spring, what he found was that the messages on his watch were nearly extraneous. Because in conversations with angry and frustrated players, as the deep freeze continued to ice free agents across an MLB landscape featuring an alarming number of clubs veering toward ""tanking,"" ""resetting"" or ""rebooting""—pick a term—he was buoyed by the sheer number of players delivering the same message as the one that kept beeping on his wrist.
Time to stand.
""The core concerns are resonating,"" Clark said. ""Whether it was on the Florida coast or out here in Arizona, players are as connected and as engaged as they've ever been.
""Whether it is players speaking among themselves, players speaking to us or us speaking with them. Whether you are a young player who just came in or a seasoned veteran, if it didn't directly affect you, it affected part of your fraternity.""
At Texas' camp in Surprise, Arizona, All-Star Adrian Beltre echoed the suggestion of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen earlier this winter that players soon may have to consider their first strike since 1994-95.
""Strike, whatever it might be, we have to stay united and stick together,"" Beltre said.
""It's great to hear those comments,"" Kansas City outfielder Jon Jay added. ""Bottom line is, we have to stay united and have each other's backs.""
At the Cubs' camp in Mesa, Arizona, All-Star Kris Bryant, the 2016 NL MVP, vowed to study up on issues and prepared to ""fight"" for the players.

""We lost,"" Bryant said flatly of the union's failure to nudge the luxury-tax payroll threshold beyond $197 million. ""But it's a situation we've got to learn from.
""I think it's opened a lot of people's eyes in terms of players who are going to speak up a little more and have their voices heard.""
At the Dodgers' camp in Glendale, Arizona, starter Alex Wood referenced the eye-opening offseason observation from Seattle GM Jerry Dipoto that from a team's perspective ""you could argue you're going to compete with more clubs to get the first pick in the draft than you would to win the World Series."" And Dipoto is management.
""The biggest thing is the integrity of the game,"" Wood said. ""Every spring we sit here and listen to Rule 21 about putting forth your best effort individually as players or as a team. And then you sit here and see half the league not putting forth their best effort to put the best product on the field.
""It makes you wonder how the commissioner and everyone can hold us to that level of accountability, but then you don't hold the organizations to that level. It makes you wonder about the situation we've gotten ourselves into.""
Time to stand, indeed.
Some five hours earlier, darkness faded around 6:45 a.m. as morning broke across the desert. Inside the white GMC Yukon as it rolled toward a meeting at the Arizona Diamondbacks complex on a chilly, 59-degree dawn, Clark, 45, did not look the part of embattled union boss.
While growing restlessness among players and agents has yielded private complaining and public questions about everything from flaws in the new agreement to Clark's job security, he was as stoic and unruffled as ever.
""My focus always has been and will continue to be the players,"" he said. ""A lot of the external stuff, I don't get caught up in. I didn't as a player, and I don't now.
""That's why sitting down with guys during spring training, asking questions of them, them asking questions of me against the backdrop of all the rhetoric that is out there, what they've heard and what they've been told…being able to do all of that has been really beneficial.""

The current Collective Bargaining Agreement was agreed to in November 2016. One of the chief issues since has been the $197 million competitive balance tax (better known as ""luxury tax"") on each club's payroll that this winter effectively acted as a salary cap. Clubs exceeding $197 million for three or more seasons are subject to a 50 percent payroll tax, as opposed to 20 percent (for exceeding it for one year) or 30 percent (for exceeding it a second year). That's no small part of the reason stars such as Eric Hosmer (Padres), J.D. Martinez (Red Sox) and Jake Arrieta (Phillies) went unsigned until after spring training started and why veterans such as Jose Bautista, Melky Cabrera and J.J. Hardy remain unsigned even after Opening Day.
And why Mike Moustakas, after swatting 38 home runs last year and declining Kansas City's one-year, $17.4 million qualifying offer, failed to land a multiyear deal and came crawling back to the Royals this spring on a one-year, $5.5 million deal with $2.2 million in incentives.
This is where Bryant said the players ""lost"" in the CBA. Clark and some players prefer patience, saying that this agreement is just 15 months old and still needs to play out because there are no significant changes in this CBA versus the old one.
""That reset has been a part of the last three agreements,"" Clark said. ""It's not new. Now…if they aren't rebooting and they are treating it as if that is the threshold to end all thresholds, then we're having a different conversation.""
Clark continued: ""And so the question for us is whether or not it is a reboot or a hard stop. If it is a hard stop for those teams or for any number of other teams, then we're in a different world.""
One of the biggest criticisms of the players union is that while it negotiated increases to the payroll threshold, they weren't enough. From 2014-16, the CBT threshold on player payrolls was $189 million. The current CBA calls for increases over each of the next five years to an eventual $210 million in 2021.
First instituted in 2003, the CBT is an attempt to level the playing field—at least to a degree—between smaller-market clubs and Goliaths like the Yankees, Dodgers and Red Sox. But with MLB revenues reaching record proportions of more than $10 billion in 2017, there are those who believe the gap between the CBT threshold and each club's individual record revenues has become so great that clubs now are incentivized to protect their record revenues—from TV rights, sponsorships, etc.—in no small part because the threshold is too low. 
""Obviously, you want the threshold as high as it can be,"" Clark said. ""The CBT has been around for 20 years. We know there are some teams that historically respond to it one way, and we know there have been other teams that have responded to it a completely different way. And we know the vast majority of the league is not affected by it because they're not close enough to it.

""So the question becomes are teams changing how they are viewing it, and how are they viewing it? That would have less to do with the changes that were made and more to do with a fundamental shift in their philosophy.""
As clubs change the way they value players and skew younger, membership is on guard. The union this winter filed a grievance against four clubs—Pittsburgh, Miami, Tampa Bay and Oakland—accusing them of failing to properly spend revenue-sharing money. This is a first. The union in the past has only threatened grievances against clubs it felt were not complying with their end of the revenue-sharing stream—Miami and Pittsburgh—and the simple threat led to productive discussions with the offenders.
""It's one thing not to look to sign a number of guys,"" Clark said. ""But it is another piece of that puzzle when you are taking remarkably talented guys and moving them off of your roster and onto other rosters in an effort to try to create that atmosphere of a race to the bottom.""
There is even clubhouse chatter that some players—including some of the game's top stars—may boycott some interviews with MLB Network television this summer, viewing the network as an extension of the owners with whom they are angry.
Some of the overall anger is being stoked by the players' representatives, many of whom are on the phone regularly venting to Clark. On Feb. 2, agent Brodie Van Wagenen fired this salvo on Twitter, writing that there is ""a rising tide among players for radical change.""
""Anytime you speak to a group of representatives who have been around for a while and they suggest we have never seen this, we have never heard this,"" Clark said, ""antennas pop.""
Exiting the SUV, Clark stretched and cleared his mind in the parking lot—time to stand—before walking inside for what will be close to a two-hour meeting with the Diamondbacks and members of his staff.
Clark is the first ex-player to lead the union. This makes him an easy target for criticism.
""I'm different than those who came before me, but my reference points in protecting players are the same,"" Clark said.
He was the handpicked choice of his predecessor, Michael Weiner, who died in November 2013, following a protracted battle with brain cancer. Weiner was an attorney, as was Don Fehr, the union boss from 1985-2009. Before them, the first head of the players' union, starting in 1966, was Marvin Miller, who was an economist for the International Association of Machinists, United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers.

For Clark, accepting Weiner's offer was the culmination of two decades of involvement in union labor issues. He started as the Detroit Tigers' player representative in 1997, just his second full season in the majors. His interest was piqued when he spent a full day at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, when he was in the Class A New York-Penn League in the early 1990s. He spent most of his time that day in the Negro Leagues area of the museum, which, he said, ""helped me understand, as a black player, the opportunity I had and the responsibility that I had.""
He saw that day the history of those who came before him and helped clear a path for him. And he understood that if he ever made it to the majors, it would come with the responsibility for doing the same for those who came after him.
By 2002, Clark moved from the player representative position to an American League Representative, a higher-ranking and more involved executive board post.
Shortly after his retirement as a player following the 2009 season, Clark accepted Weiner's invitation for a full-time executive board position.
""That's the role I anticipated having until Michael rode into the sunset,"" Clark said. ""When he did, I would as well. Unfortunately, a couple of years later he's diagnosed with a brain tumor, and we lose him a couple of years after that.""
Lines between management and labor were clear when Clark came up as a young player: The 1994-95 strike at the time was the fifth work stoppage in 22 years, and it was the mother of them all, lasting 232 days, longest in MLB history. Clark debuted as a rookie for the Tigers late in the '95 season after the players came back earlier that spring.
""I was very fortunate to come into the game when I did, surrounded by the player leadership that I was,"" Clark said. ""And how that's shaped my perspective of the game on the field, in the industry, off of it and my responsibilities inherent within it.""
It is the players, he emphasized, who drive the strategies. It is their union. His job simply is to understand their disposition on the issues and make judgments accordingly. And as Clark made the rounds this spring, he sensed strengthening resolve from a new generation of players who are fed up with what they view as the owners' duplicity following a long era of peace.
He hints at a coming intellectual arms race, conceding that the union is planning to increase its heft, noting that adding ""talent and expertise in a number of areas""—including legal and communications—""is something we're looking at.""
""The CBA gets thicker and thicker,"" he continued. ""How we function as an organization both now and moving forward has to adapt.""

Frustrated as some players are, some of the rhetoric is a little—or a lot—overheated.
For one thing, because players are in the middle of a negotiated contract, it is illegal for them to strike. That would have to wait until the current agreement expires after the '21 season.
Another is the idea that, in the last talks, the union fumbled some key issues such as payroll tax thresholds and compensatory draft picks tied to free agency to win luxury items such as extra seats on the team bus and a chef in every clubhouse. While it is true that the players wanted—and ultimately won—the bus and chef items, the union says that to portray negotiating away the big stuff in exchange for those ""luxury"" items is absurd.
""That's one of the most ridiculous things I heard all offseason,"" Clark said. ""Sure, there are things that didn't exist before [such as the chefs]. But it did not come at the expense of not paying attention to the other pieces. Any number of folks are going to look at any number of items differently.
""Those who are trying to keep score likely haven't been in a bargaining room.""
Bottom line is, certain items are shut-down-the-game issues. While the players are getting killed now for not forcing the luxury-tax threshold higher, until this current agreement they were doing just fine in free agency as MLB hit record revenues.
There were no egregious wrongs to right.
""Ideally, we want everybody to get to free agency earlier and we want the competitive balance tax to be incredibly high,"" Andrew Miller, the Cleveland reliever and a key union figure as an association representative, said. ""But the reality is you have to negotiate these things and find a way to make them work for you. The game is in a really good place, and the agreement didn't actually change that much from 2011 to 2016.
""To say this hasn't worked the way we envisioned I think would be fair. But to say it's a failure, I don't think that's fair.""
As for the ""luxury"" items criticism, Miller said: ""Players get engaged in that because it's something we know and can relate to. The reality is, a lot of the big stuff, we trust economists and lawyers on that. They drive that conversation. Certainly, players are engaged in on-field issues, whether it's pace of play, things to do with uniforms, things we understand.
""But the reality is, we didn't sacrifice anything in draft-pick compensation to let guys wear cleats they want to wear. That's misinformed and disingenuous, and I get frustrated when I read that and hear that. It's just wrong.""
Spring is the time of renewal, and whether cacti or palm trees fill the landscape outside the windows—and from the inside of Clark's GMC Yukon as we departed the Diamondbacks camp and rode toward breakfast, it's both—this year, ""renewal"" is a loaded word.
Several players and even a few union officials recalled former Commissioner Bud Selig's mantra, that all MLB markets should contain ""hope and faith"" heading into each Opening Day. While that always was a naive goal (see: Cleveland, from about 1969-93, among many other clubs), never before has the game seen this sort of behavior by so many clubs looking long term instead of short term.

""Everything about the CBA is grounded in the ability for teams to compete every year,"" Clark said. ""Whether it's revenue sharing, how those dollars are distributed, the flexibility in the system on how to use those dollars, it was always done against the backdrop of each team doing everything it can with the resources it has to put itself in a position to be the last team standing.
""When there are professed interests by upwards of a third of the clubs [to rebuild instead of compete in 2018], if some of what we're seeing and hearing is to be believed, that's a concern. It's a concern because we all have a vested interest in the excitement around Opening Day, around the excitement, around the possibilities that exist because the ball does bounce funny ways sometimes. And so when that many teams say, intimate or suggest a salary dump, you just hope there isn't an adverse effect on the industry as a whole.""
Said Miller: ""It's easy to see why these organizations want to copy what the Cubs and Astros did. I don't think either side, players or owners, ever thought in the offseason of 2017-2018 it would be acceptable to the fans to tank. But now it's not hard to go read a message board or look at comments on FanGraphs or TradeRumors when the Pirates or Rays start dumping guys and seeing that people are OK with rebuilds. … I don't think we saw that coming, and it needs to be addressed.""
A big test will come next winter when high-impact free agents Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Josh Donaldson and others—Clayton Kershaw, if he opts out of his contract—come onto the market. It is possible that the Yankees, Dodgers and others sat out this winter's free-agent market in anticipation of that. And it's among the reasons Cleveland's Miller said he is taking a bigger-picture view than many others.
""Free agency is supposed to be a reward for players who have paid their dues, and it didn't work this year. That does not mean this deal is bad or irredeemable. We have to wait and see, and we have to make it work for us. The unfortunate thing is the players who do get caught [waiting for a contract].""
Miller has worked as closely with Clark as anyone and has no doubts that Clark is the right man to lead the players.
""It's not like there are people out there just walking down the street who are ready to become the executive director of a sports union. The reality is those people are hard to find.
""When we went through that process, Michael [Weiner] was a big part of it. And as much as we love Michael, his recommendation was Tony.
""There's always going to be growing pains. The reality is ... I think he's done a great job. Things aren't always going to go your way. Things aren't always going to be sunshine and rainbows. … We have to find a way to get through all this, and I think he's the right guy.""
Clark, who took the position over several other opportunities within the game—broadcasting, coaching, managing and front office work—said he made this move because he felt it would connect him to ""former, current and future fraternity members. There was no other job or opportunity that provided that significant a touch point for the group that I was most concerned about or believed in the most.""
Since taking the top job, Clark hasn't even paused for a vacation. Too many responsibilities keep him tethered to the union's 1,200 members. He'll steal a three-day weekend here or a day there when he feels the walls closing in, and he makes sure to be home each afternoon in time to see his son's basketball or baseball game. In addition to his son Aeneas, who is 15 and plays shortstop and third base, Tony and his wife, Frances, also have two older daughters, Kiara, 23, and Jazzin, 20.

""Bottom line is, he knows what he's gotten into,"" said former infielder Damion Easley, whose family is so close with Clark's that they were neighbors in Phoenix for several years until the Clarks moved to New Jersey when Tony became the union chief. ""It's a borderline thankless job; it really is. It's hard to please everyone. You've got different spectrums or players; you try to do the best job you can for each level of player.""
He still exercises when he can—bike, treadmill, weights, some jogging—but especially at this time of year, spring tour in full force, that time too often disappears into the hours sitting in planes, cars and meetings.
""I'm holding on for dear life,"" he quipped. ""If you give me truth serum, or even if you don't, there are times when I sure don't feel like a professional athlete.""
By the time the current labor deal expires, there will have been 26 consecutive seasons uninterrupted by work stoppages, dating all the way back to when Clark played. It is the longest run of labor peace since the MLBPA became a recognized union in 1966.
As for where things go from here, well, it's all part of what Clark jokes is ""turning my gray to silver, quick."" And while he concedes that some days are more challenging than others, Clark presses onward, viewing his position as more of a calling than a job.
""Every player, whether I know him or not, or have direct interaction with him or not, is personal to me,"" Clark said. ""So being in this … that's an easy one.""
With that, he glances at his wrist. Morning has slipped into afternoon, and he's due at the airport to pick up his wife.
But first, as he lifts himself out of the booth … it is time to stand.

Los Angeles Angels pitcher and designated hitter Shohei Ohtani made his MLB pitching debut on Sunday, allowing three runs in six innings and leaving the game with the Angels leading the Oakland Athletics.
The Angels won the game, 7-4.
The heralded rookie responded to a spotty spring training with an excellent first start, displaying his nasty stuff in the process:
Shohei Ohtani showed just how meaningless spring training can be; He gives up just 3 hits in six innings, averaging 98 mph on his fastball and throwing 63 of his 92 pitches for strikes
Shohei Ohtani threw 39 fastballs today. The average velocity: 97.8 mph. Hit 100 three times and 99 nine more. In all, he generated 18 swings and misses. Raw stuff is devastating. Particularly the splitter, which he threw 11 times in the final two IP, with five swings and misses.
That's it for Ohtani. Pretty sporty six innings. Stuff is elite, as we knew. Leaves a 7-3 lead to bullpen.
Ohtani also struck out six batters and walked just one in the contest.
At times, Ohtani looked downright unhittable:
Filthy. Shohei Ohtani with his first career strikeout on the first batter he faces in his MLB debut.

That didn't stop Matt Chapman from blasting a three-run homer against him in the bottom of the second, however: 
Matt Chapman says, “Welcome to The Show.” https://t.co/IVNazlT1WW
As Bob Nightengale of USA Today noted, Ohtani calmed down after the blast, retiring 14 of the last 15 hitters he faced.
And B/R's Zachary D. Rymer didn't think the home run was solely on Ohtani: 
I'd also say that the homer was more of a good swing by Chapman than a bad pitch by Ohtani. https://t.co/Xqjul9bpsJ
Ohtani, 23, made his MLB debut as a designated hitter on Thursday, singling in his first at-bat. He finished 1-for-5.
""I had some good at-bats and some not so good at-bats,"" he said after that game, per Paul Gutierrez of ESPN.com. ""That (first) at-bat, I'm probably never going to forget the rest of my life. Now I have to have better at-bats to help the team.""
And his manager, Mike Scioscia, reiterated after that game that the Angels firmly believe in his talent:
""We know that Shohei, just like any player, is excited but Shohei is well beyond his years as far analyzing the game and going out there and understanding his talent. We're very comfortable that he's going to go out there and compete very well and hopefully help us win. I think the illusion might be he's taking things in stride but he's very confident and I don't know if you get a sense of how hard he's worked to get acclimated to baseball in the United States. I think he's done a great job and we feel he's ready.""
Ohtani then was given Friday and Saturday off in anticipation of pitching on Sunday, and he certainly lived up to the hype in his first start. As Rymer noted, his slider remains a work in progress, but both his fastball and splitter looked fantastic.
""All I know is that I wouldn't want to be tasked with hitting Ohtani's splitter,"" Rymer added.",sports

Rivalries are landmarks of the college football season. Whether friendly or hate-filled, fans typically look forward to their favorite program taking on its historic nemesis.
But not every year is so fun.
In 2018, some supporters will be circling a specific date on their calendar—and desperately working to avoid the matchup. It seems like a great day to schedule that thing you really need to do!
Based on current projections and health status, these rivalries probably won't be competitive in the coming fall. Hey, there's always next year, right?

When: Saturday, Sep. 8
South Carolina should have a respectable team in 2018 and cruise to bowl eligibility. But this is an unfavorable early clash.
While the Gamecocks are trying to settle a rebuilt defense, they'll host Georgia in the second week of September. The reigning national runner-up will boast an experienced offensive line in front of quarterback Jake Fromm and potential star runner D'Andre Swift.
Containing the Dawgs will be one massive challenge, and South Carolina still isn't built to keep up through the air. Jake Bentley has never not thrown an interception opposite a team that ended the season ranked and is 1-5 in those six games.
That may start to change during the upcoming season, but we're not banking on that improvement showing up so soon against an elite defense.

When: Saturday, Sep. 22
Michigan State kicks off Big Ten action with a trip to Bloomington, where the Hoosiers will have a new-look defense. In recent history, that wouldn't have been a horrible thing. But Indiana had a strong unit in 2017, finishing 19th in yards per play allowed.
The Spartans sat one spot ahead in those rankings, and they have a clear and obvious advantage in who remains on the roster.
According to Bill Connelly of SB Nation, Michigan State returns the fifth-most defensive production. The Hoosiers have the fifth-lowest percentage of contributions coming back in 2018.
Indiana snatched the Old Brass Spittoon in 2016, but East Lansing should house the trophy for another year.

When: Saturday, Sep. 22
One week after defending Georgia Southern's rushing attack, Clemson will turn its attention to rival Georgia Tech.
This matchup hasn't gone well for the Yellow Jackets lately, and the outlook isn't getting any more favorable.
Over the last three seasons, Clemson has posted a combined score of 93-41 while surrendering just 2.96 yards per carry. The ACC powerhouse boasts a trio of likely 2019 first-round draft picks (Dexter Lawrence, Clelin Ferrell and Christian Wilkins) and a potential fourth (Austin Bryant) on the defensive line.
Good luck scoring, Tech.

When: Saturday, Oct. 13
Although the Mountain West being separated into two divisions ended the annual meeting, Nevada might not want to see Boise State that often anyway.
Last year, the Broncos enjoyed a 41-14 rout. They keep nearly all of their defensive production from 2017, basically only losing Leighton Vander Esch. Though he leaves a big void, every other starter returns.
Plus, Nevada had one of the nation's worst pass defenses in 2017. Quarterback Brett Rypien didn't have the season expected of him as a junior but is a prime bounce-back candidate.
Unless home-field advantage benefits the Pack to an unanticipated degree, Boise State should roll in this Mountain West affair.

When: Saturday, Oct. 20
From 1995 to 2006, Tennessee owned the Third Saturday in October. The Vols won 10 of 12 matchups during that span.
Since then, it's been all Alabama—and we mean all Alabama. Head coach Nick Saban has rattled off 11 consecutive victories in the rivalry.
The arrival of new coach Jeremy Pruitt, a Saban disciple, in Knoxville suggests more competitive days are coming, but we also shouldn't get ahead of ourselves. After all, the last two clashes have resulted in final scores of 49-10 and 45-7, and the Vols are in rebuild mode.
Tennessee would need a heroic performance from its quarterback, likely Jarrett Guarantano, to keep the 2018 meeting close.

When: Friday, Nov. 23
Quarterback Justin Herbert missed five games due to a broken collarbone in 2017, and the offense was completely unrecognizable. After returning in mid-November, his second outing was against Oregon State and...yikes.
Oregon steamrolled the Beavers 69-10, amassing 577 yards of total offense while limiting the in-state foe to 211 yards and forcing three turnovers. More of the same should be expected from the Ducks, who have a stable of backs ready to replace Royce Freeman.
Even if Oregon State quarterback Jake Luton makes a healthy return from a scary spinal injury, his value to the offense isn't worth 59 points.

When: Friday, Nov. 23
Luke Falk is chasing the NFL, and the tragic suicide of Tyler Hilinski removes all experience from Washington State's quarterback room.
Plus, the offensive line loses a couple of key cogs. The system is built to withstand changes, but the Cougs have consistently struggled with rival Washington anyway. During the last three seasons, they've fallen 45-10, 45-17 and 41-14. Wazzu's most recent series win came in 2012.
To make matters worse, as Washington State retools its roster, Washington has the build of a national championship contender. The defense should be sensational yet again.
Cougars fans may decide to prioritize family over football during Thanksgiving week a little extra this year.

Former UCLA coach Jim Mora believes his former quarterback Josh Rosen is the best player available in the 2018 NFL draft and offered further explanation for his previous comments on the signal-caller.
NFL Network shared Mora's comments where the coach notably said, ""Do I think he's the best QB in the draft? No. I think he's the best player in the draft:""
""Do I think he's the best QB in the draft? No.

I think he's the best player in the draft.""

📺: #UpToTheMinute https://t.co/g2ae0fcphn
Mora also said of Rosen, ""Being a young man that needs to be intellectually challenged is a positive; that says that he is very, very smart and he wants to understand the game.""
The explanation was in response to the reaction from his previous comments to Peter King of The MMQB when he talked about Rosen's desire to understand why he is doing something.
""He needs to be challenged intellectually so he doesn't get bored,"" Mora told King. ""He's a millennial. He wants to know why. Millennials, once they know why, they're good. Josh has a lot of interests in life. If you can hold his concentration level and focus only on football for a few years, he will set the world on fire. He has so much ability, and he's a really good kid.""
Ross Tucker of NBC Sports Network noted Mora's previous comments on Rosen could cause some scouts and coaches to question the UCLA product's dedication to the game:
I'd guess close to 50% of NFL scouts/coaches, who really don't have other interests, have ""DOESN'T LOVE FOOTBALL"" flashing in their heads when they read this quote. https://t.co/VsjqVf9RFt
While Rosen has been openly critical of the NCAA and weighed in on a number of topics outside of football, it didn't stop him from throwing for 3,756 yards, 26 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 2017 for the Bruins and elevating himself to a potential top-five pick in the draft.
Bleacher Report's Matt Miller projected Rosen to go No. 6 overall to the Buffalo Bills (in a predicted trade) in his most recent mock draft and called him ""the prettiest passer of this loaded quarterback group.""
Mora made it clear he thinks Rosen is the best player in this draft, but the presence of other quarterback prospects in Sam Darnold, Josh Allen and Baker Mayfield means he may not even be the first player at his position selected on April 26.",sports

When the 2017-18 men's college basketball season began, the Loyola of Chicago Ramblers were nowhere close to being projected nationally as a Final Four qualifier. This fall, a team on the gridiron could make a similar ascent from afterthought to College Football Playoff hopeful.
Given last season's performance, returning starters and production and other favorable circumstances, we've highlighted six programs with the potential to climb the rankings in 2018.
Will they all threaten? Absolutely not. But the Georgia Bulldogs soared from 8-5 in 2016 to 13-2 last season, winning the SEC championship before reaching the national title game. The path has been achieved.
Each of the programs featured won 10 games or fewer last year.

2017 recap: After opening the season with three losses in five games, Northwestern rattled off eight consecutive wins to close the campaign. That included a win over Michigan State, which finished the year ranked 15th in the Associated Press Top 25. NU's defense ranked 23rd nationally.
2018 outlook: Head coach Pat Fitzgerald has built a perennial bowl contender, but the recovery of quarterback Clayton Thorson is a glaring potential issue. The rising senior is recovering from a torn ACL. The Wildcats also must replace Justin Jackson, a four-time 1,000-yard rusher. Northwestern has a tough schedule, but most of those difficult matchups are at home.
The CFP path: Can the Wildcats survive the opening stretch? They mustered a 3-5 mark in September over the last two seasons. If NU can accomplish that, a pair of two-game stretches (Michigan/Michigan State and Wisconsin/Notre Dame) will determine the height of success. Only the matchup with MSU is on the road, so Northwestern could surge if it protects home field.    

2017 recap: Virginia Tech took a 7-1 record into November and had a Coastal Division title within reach. However, the Miami Hurricanes and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets toppled VT in consecutive weeks. The Hokies, who relied on a freshman quarterback in Josh Jackson, ended the season with a loss to Oklahoma State in the Camping World Bowl in Orlando, Florida.
2018 outlook: Jackson showed great promise before a rough November, so his development is a critical topic. The defense is slightly more concerning, but it appears Virginia Tech has a sturdy group of returning talent to replace Tremaine Edmunds, Terrell Edmunds and Greg Stroman. Opening the season on the road against Florida State should be a great test for the Hokies, who later host Notre Dame and Miami.
The CFP path: If Tech can steal a victory at FSU, the next three contests are opposite non-power (or FCS) teams. A 4-0 start could set up a rested Hokies roster for a strong start to the bulk of ACC play. That's when Jackson's progression would really need to become apparent, especially Nov. 17 against the Hurricanes.  

2017 recap: Oregon jumped out to a 4-1 start, but a collarbone injury to quarterback Justin Herbert derailed the Pac-12 squad's season. The Ducks dropped four of the next five games, only scoring more than 14 points once in a stretch that preceded Willie Taggart's departure to coach Florida State. Oregon limped to a 7-6 record.
2018 outlook: Defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt has provided some much-needed optimism after the unit climbed from 115th in yards per play allowed in his first season with the Ducks to 28th last season. Oregon is losing a handful of starters, but six freshmen earned significant time too. Their development combined with a healthy Herbert should put Oregon back on track to contend for a Pac-12 crown.
The CFP path: Herbert must be on the field. 2017 showed Oregon's brutal lack of usable depth at the position. The Ducks also need to defeat Stanford (Sep. 22) and Washington (Oct. 13). Both showdowns are in Eugene at Autzen Stadium, and wins would likely make Oregon 6-0. From there, it's a matter of surviving road trips to Washington State and Arizona and a home game against UCLA.

2017 recap: One year after finishing 3-9, Michigan State shot right back up the Big Ten standings with a 10-3 record. Mark Dantonio's club only dropped clashes with Notre Dame, Northwestern and Ohio State—three year-end ranked teams—while upsetting both Michigan and Penn State. The defense finished No. 18 in the country.
2018 outlook: Last season, 14 players notched at least 15 tackles. Chris Frey and Demetrius Cooper were the only seniors. Michigan State is both young and experienced on defense. Dual-threat quarterback Brian Lewerke is an intriguing talent, but the rising junior must be consistently effective against top competition—namely Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State.
The CFP path: Nothing is ever assumed, but the Spartans should begin the year 4-0. Their next three contests are Northwestern, at Penn State and Michigan, and anything worse than 2-1 would effectively eliminate MSU. Barring a future upset, the Nov. 10 matchup with Ohio State would determine the front-runner in the Big Ten East.

2017 recap: Florida State's championship hopes disappeared in the season opener when a knee injury sidelined Deondre Francois for the rest of the year. Hurricane Irma also delayed two games, and head coach Jimbo Fisher bolted for a job at Texas A&M. The Seminoles mustered a 7-6 record during the setback-filled year.
2018 outlook: Francois is limited this spring, but he should reclaim the starting spot in the fall once healthy. The offense will be adapting to Willie Taggart's uptempo system, too. Although several NFL-bound defenders are gone, available talent is no concern for the unit. Joshua Kaindoh and Levonta Taylor highlight the players ready for a leading role.
The CFP path: On the bright side, the schedule is loaded with marquee games. No upset loss would crush the 'Noles, who host Virginia Tech, Clemson and Florida and travel to Louisville, Miami, NC State and Notre Dame. But that's a hugely difficult schedule. FSU needs Francois to regain his 2016 form while running back Cam Akers makes the leap from prized freshman to superstar sophomore.

2017 recap: Led by Florida transfer Will Grier, the Mountaineers compiled a 7-3 record while only losing to ranked teams. That should be the focus, since Grier's finger injury took a top-10 quarterback off the field. West Virginia lost its final three contests without him.
2018 outlook: Grier and All-American wideout David Sills V are back, as well as 1,000-yard receiver Gary Jennings. Between them, Kennedy McKoy and Marcus Simms, the 'Eers boast one of the nation's most formidable scoring attacks. Al-Rasheed Benton and Kyzir White leave major voids on defense, but last season's inexperienced D-line is a year older and will bolster the unit.
The CFP path: Defeating both Tennessee and NC State is essential because November is a minefield. The Mountaineers end 2018 opposite Texas, TCU, Oklahoma State and Oklahoma—all of which defeated WVU last year. (Yes, Grier was unavailable against UT and OU, though the latter would've been favored.) That's a treacherous finish, but the Mountaineers have the firepower to compete with anyone.

The UFC's lightweight division is an absolute mess ahead of UFC 223's Max Holloway vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov bout. With Conor McGregor still sitting as the official lightweight champion, interim champion Tony Ferguson out with a knee injury and the Holloway vs. Nurmagomedov bout set to throw another belt into the equation, things are set to be more confusing than ever.
Nurmagomedov doesn't care about that, though.
Despite the fact that he may or may not be set to ascend to the UFC's lightweight throne, the grappling specialist isn't looking to wipe out any pretenders to his throne. Speaking to Ariel Helwani on Monday's installment of The MMA Hour, he said if it were up to him, he'd look to take down another king...all-time great fighter Georges St-Pierre.

""To be honest, I think maybe different. I think about Georges St-Pierre,"" he said. ""Because he talks about how he can make 155. He already middleweight and welterweight champion. Why not? Why not now for his legacy and my legacy. It’s very important. You know, like, if UFC make this fight for me, not easy fight. For him, not easy fight.""
Nurmagomedov's UFC career has been defined by two things to this point: utter dominance in the cage and almost non-stop misfortune outside it.
After amassing a strong five-fight winning streak in his first 18 months with the promotion, Nurmagomedov's career went off the rails in 2014 when he withdrew from a scheduled bout with Donald ""Cowboy"" Cerrone. That kicked off a series of injuries and weight cutting issues that saw Nurmagomedov fight just four times from 2014 to 2017. 
Despite those struggles, he returned from a yearlong layoff in December 2017 by steamrolling veteran striker Edson Barboza. That win re-established him as an elite contender in the cage and reminded fans of his terrifying potential. Meanwhile, an uptick in his trash-talk made him a steady source of headlines and made him one of the all-around most marketable fighters. 
While Nurmagomedov doesn't necessarily care about that and remains exclusively focused on fighting, he knows the UFC brass doesn't feel the same way. As such, he fully expects the company to push for a bout between himself and McGregor, which he acknowledges isn't the worst thing in the world.

""It's the most interesting fight in MMA and boxing right now,"" he told Helwani when asked if he would ever face McGregor. ""One hundred percent, the UFC is going to try and push me vs. Conor.""
Of course, Nurmagomedov can't make too many plans for his fighting future right now. Though Holloway is likely to be a considerable underdog in their fight on Saturday, the Hawaiian didn't chance his way into the featherweight championship.
Nurmagomedov faces a serious challenge at UFC 223, but if he can overcome it, there are some very, very big fights for him just over the horizon.",sports

Max Holloway will replace Tony Ferguson at UFC 223 after the lightweight champion suffered a knee injury in a ""freak accident,"" per Brett Okamoto of ESPN.
UFC President Dana White announced the injury on Instagram:
A photo posted by Dana White (@danawhite)
Holloway will take on Khabib Nurmagomedov on six days' notice as the headline event for the April 7 pay-per-view.
Ferguson's ""ligament tore completely off the bone"" late last week, per Okamoto.
Ferguson won the interim lightweight championship last October with a win over Kevin Lee via submission. He replaced Conor McGregor, who has not competed in UFC since taking on Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a boxing match last summer.
The matchup against Nurmagomedov was set to create a new undisputed champion, and as White announced, that title is still on the line even with Holloway stepping in.
Holloway, the current featherweight champion, is coming off back-to-back knockout wins over Jose Aldo to become the undisputed winner at his weight class. He hasn't lost since 2013 in a battle against McGregor, although moving up from 145 to 155 could be a challenge, especially with short notice.
Meanwhile, Nurmagomedov enters the upcoming bout with an undefeated 25-0 record and could finally get an opportunity to bring home a belt.
Luke Thomas of SiriusXM provided a quick breakdown of the fight:
There's a case to be made Holloway is a bad match up for Nurmagomedov. Some will scoff at the idea, but he has lights out TD defense and, more importantly, excels at that defense along the fence.

Add in killer cardio, jab, ambidextrous stance and more.

This fight is compelling.
He and Ferguson have been scheduled to fight several times in the past, with the Russian most recently backing out because of problems managing weight last March for UFC 209. Chamatkar Sandhu of USA Today noted the problems with getting these two together:
Tony Ferguson vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov should never be booked ever again. This is one fight that is destined never to happen. I feel sick.
Hopefully, Holloway represents a quality replacement worthy of the PPV Saturday.",sports

As the premiere brand in mixed martial arts, the UFC is the home to the best fighters in the world. With very few exceptions, their roster has the absolute top talent in the sport and its depth is absolutely unmatched. 
However, they don’t always have all of the top talent.
Every now and then they’ll find themselves in a position where a competing promotion finds a fighter and grooms him or her into something special, and it’s eventually up to the UFC to go out and acquire that fighter in free agency.
Oftentimes, it works out nicely. The UFC shells out big bucks and lands an Eddie Alvarez or Justin Gaethje, who immediately prove their worth at the top of their weight class. They may even go buy a whole promotion or a collection of contracts from a promotion, and net themselves names like Lyoto Machida, Rampage Jackson, Ronda Rousey or Miesha Tate by doing so.
But every now and then there are busts—just as there are in any sport’s free-agency process. There are fighters the UFC acquires and either doesn’t promote properly, doesn’t match properly, or who just plain prove they don’t belong on the sport’s biggest stage despite their having success on smaller stages.
Here are six of the biggest such busts.

Hector Lombard
Non-UFC Record: 31-2-1
First UFC Fight: Loss to Tim Boetsch, UFC 149
UFC Record Overall: 3-7 (1)
In his time in Bellator there was a real case that Lombard was the best middleweight in the world not named Anderson Silva.
It was as much about how he was dispatching his foes as it was about who he was fighting, given that he was violently stopping guys almost every time out. He had the grappling prowess to control where a fight occurred, and the fistic expertise to lay fools out with a single shot and that produced plenty of exciting and memorable highlights along the way.
He came to the UFC in 2012 with some serious hype, a man people thought could be on his way to a fight with Silva after warming up in a pay-per-view co-main event against Tim Boetsch. Instead he narrowly lost to Boetsch, split a couple of more fights at 185 before dropping a class and was a welterweight afterthought before too long.
It’s crazy to think that he was the same guy who’d helped prop Bellator up for so long, but once he got in with the big dogs, he flagged considerably. He’s presently lost five straight fights and hasn’t won in four years overall. 

Wanderlei Silva
Non-UFC Record: 30-7-1
First UFC Fight: Win over Tony Petarra, UFC 20
UFC Record Overall: 5-6
This is a painful inclusion on the list, because for a number of years Wanderlei Silva was among the most popular fighters to ever throw leather in this game. And during his time in PRIDE, he was about as successful as anyone to ever do it as well, seen by many to be among the top handful of athletes ever to compete in MMA. 
However, the late period of his career, with curiosity surrounding his relationship with PEDs and various bizarre feuds, has taken some of the shine off The Axe Murderer. His run in the UFC leading up to that didn’t help either.
Silva was 1-1 in the UFC back in the late-90s before heading to Japan to become a legend. He signed to return to the promotion in 2007, where he fought Chuck Liddell in one of the greatest wars the sport has ever seen—and one that he lost. It was the start of a largely forgettable 4-5 stretch that saw him suffer two vicious knockout losses and float around finding meaningless catchweight fights from time to time.
He ended his UFC run with a memorable win over Brian Stann in 2012, though, bookending his second stint in the promotion with great fights. The results were not particularly great overall, however.

Will Brooks
Non-UFC Record: 17-1
First UFC Fight: Win over Ross Pearson, The Ultimate Fighter Finale: Team Joanna vs. Team Claudia
UFC Record Overall: 1-3
Brooks is probably the least well-known name on the list, as he quietly amassed a hit list over his pre-UFC career. His biggest claim to fame was a run to the Bellator lightweight championship, a title he defeated Michael Chandler for and then defended a couple of times. 
He left that promotion as its reigning champion and joined the UFC with some hype, living up to it in a win over longtime divisional stalwart Ross Pearson in his debut. However, that would be the only win he’d ever collect under the UFC banner, as he went on to suffer three straight stoppage losses in the course of a little over a year.
The UFC cut him not long after that, much to the shock of those who thought he was destined to become a major player in their 155-pound class. He’ll make the move to PFL in 2018 and attempt to win that promotion’s Million Dollar Tournament, but many still wonder how someone so talented to flame out so badly in MMA’s biggest company. 

Mirko Cro Cop
Non-UFC Record: 21-4-2
First UFC Fight: Win over Eddie Sanchez, UFC 67
UFC Record Overall: 5-6
Save for Silva, nobody on this list could even begin to boast as big a name, career or mythology as that of Mirko Cro Cop. He spent the early 2000s kicking people to the moon with his tree trunk legs, famously establishing the creed: ""Right leg hospital; left leg cemetery.""
And there were nights he was winning in PRIDE that you’d think it was an honest possibility.
When that promotion folded and the UFC brought some of its biggest stars into the Octagon, Cro Cop was the main attraction. People were practically frothing at the mouth at the idea of Cro Cop throwing down with then-heavyweight champion Randy Couture, and after an easy TKO win over Eddie Sanchez in his debut the stage was set.
Until it wasn’t.
The UFC decided to give Cro Cop another fight, this time with Gabriel Gonzaga. Gonzaga promptly knocked Cro Cop out cold—with a head kick of course, because the MMA Gods are a fickle and nasty breed—and the Couture fight was immediately off the table.
Furthermore, the Croatian never recovered. He lost again and left the promotion, returning a couple of years later for an uninspired 3-4 run. He finished up 5-6 in the UFC overall (though he got a win over Gonzaga in 2015), a staggeringly disappointing run for one of the top heavyweights ever.

Takanori Gomi
Non-UFC Record: 31-5 (1)
First UFC Fight: Loss to Kenny Florian, UFC Fight Night: Florian vs. Gomi
UFC Record Overall: 4-9
Gomi’s most famous fight arguably happened in his final fight for PRIDE, where Nick Diaz boxed him up and eventually submitted him. Diaz hit a nearly unhittable gogoplata to finish the fight. Diaz, predictably, was busted for marijuana afterward and the whole thing was turned into a no-contest, but Gomi became famous almost by osmosis. 
He was also a hell of a fighter in his day, though. He was an absolute marauder in the Japanese MMA scene, going 27-2 in fights in his home country over the first eight years of his career. In fact, his only losses in that time were to Marcus Aurelio, Joachim Hansen and BJ Penn, none of whom would be considered a pushover by anyone in the know.
Still, by the time he debuted with the UFC in 2010, you could see something was off. He didn’t have much for Kenny Florian in his debut, and back-to-back submission losses to Clay Guida and a surging Nate Diaz only compounded matters. He won consecutive UFC fights for the only time in his career in 2012 but lost five straight on his way to a release in 2017.
He might have been more had he made the jump to the UFC sooner, but as it was, he didn’t turn out to be much of an investment for the promotion.

Gilbert Melendez
Non-UFC Record: 21-2
First UFC Fight: Loss to Benson Henderson, UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Melendez
UFC Record Overall: 1-5
Another one who didn’t satisfy many people, seeing Melendez falter in the UFC was a borderline tragedy. 
A charter member of the beloved Skrap Pack, along with the Diaz brothers and Jake Shields, Melendez was seen to be the best lightweight outside of the UFC when he held the Strikeforce lightweight title. He could wrestle, had good stand-up and was an excellent jiu-jitsu practitioner thanks to his time with his Skrap Pack mates, and there wasn’t much to suggest that would change when he got to the UFC.
His first UFC fight was against Benson Henderson, and it was a painful, narrow decision loss that probably rightfully should have gone his way. He beat Diego Sanchez in a crazy fight at UFC 166, then got tapped in a second UFC title shot soon after and hasn’t won a fight since.
He’s now down at featherweight and hoping to rebound from a loss there in September of last year, but based on what people knew him to be back in 2009-2011, his 1-5 record is about as shocking as any bad UFC showing on this list.

this HW fight deserves HL
oxygen drama ended in armbar from the mount by Juan Bezuidenhout (EFC) https://t.co/GaJrDYJLUA
Fighting isn't for everyone. Especially for those who lack the prerequisite cardio to defend themselves properly.
Matunga Djikasa was that person when he took on Juan Bezuidenhout at EFC Worldwide 68 in Cape Town, South Africa.
Halfway through the second round of the fight, Djikasa had zero gas in the tank, and his body completely shut down on him. He dropped his arms to his side and lightly swayed.
Bezuidenhout knew the fight was his for the taking and threw a spinning backfist simply because he could.
Bezuidenhout ended up taking the fight to the ground, where he'd go on to submit Djikasa via armbar from the mounted position.
Nobody wins all their fights in mixed martial arts. But perhaps Djikasa, who was 0-0 coming into the match, should consider another line of work.",sports

UFC featherweight champion Max Holloway has a big challenge ahead of him in the undefeated Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 223. He also has the challenge of making weight ahead of time. I spoke to his nutritionist George Lockhart about what that process looks (1:31)
It was not an April Fool's joke, unfortunately.
The UFC really did lose its lightweight title matchup between Tony Ferguson and Khabib Nurmagomedov on April 1, which was scheduled to headline Saturday's UFC 223 in Brooklyn. Ferguson withdrew due to injury.
Luckily, featherweight champion Max Holloway agreed to take Ferguson's place, even though he hasn't been training regularly.
Editor's PicksTen-point plan intended to curb weight cutting coming to CaliforniaThe state of California is on the verge of significant policy reform concerning extreme weight cutting, which executive officer Andy Foster describes as a ""clear and present danger"" to MMA.
The state of California is on the verge of significant policy reform concerning extreme weight cutting, which executive officer Andy Foster describes as a ""clear and present danger"" to MMA.
One of the greatest challenges he'll face over this week is making weight. Holloway, 26, needs to be 155 pounds by Friday's weigh-in.
To get a better idea on where Holloway is now -- and what the next five days will look like -- ESPN spoke to renowned nutritionist George Lockhart, who is overseeing Holloway's weight cut in New York.
ESPN: What was the initial conversation between you and Holloway's camp in regards to accepting the fight?
Lockhart: I got the call from Max's manager asking, ""Hey man, can we do this?"" I was like, ""What's his weight?"" And he's heavy, obviously. He hasn't been training. I had to call Max and get the basics of everything, how much he's been eating and what he's been eating. It's almost beneficial he's been eating poorly, because once these guys clean up their diet, you see that weight drop really quick.
Brian [Butler-Au, Holloway's manager] told me, ""We're not doing this unless it's done healthy. He's not doing permanent damage to his body doing this."" I promised him, ""There's no f---ing way we're getting to a point where we risk his health or the longevity of his career.""
ESPN: Are you able to say what he weighs right now?
Lockhart: This is going to be tied for the biggest weight cut I've ever done. The other one that was this much [not Max], we only had four days to make it. The circumstances were very different, but as far as time goes, we actually have more time on this one.
ESPN: Under these circumstances, what is the most Holloway could have weighed where you would have agreed to attempt this cut?
Lockhart: I think, like, 187 pounds would have been an automatic, ""No way in hell.""
ESPN: So, Holloway has a substantial amount of weight to lose by Friday. What's the strategy?
Lockhart: They're not gonna lose that amount of weight in six days. You can't lose that much weight -- but you can cut that much weight. Losing weight is losing calories and your body leaning out. In this case we need to do both: lose weight and cut the water.
This is rare -- I want people to know that -- but he's going to be an extreme 'keto state.' We need him to burn as much fat as humanly possible. Whereas every other fighter we're working with this week at UFC 223 has already lost the fat, coming in shredded and just needing to cut water, Max has to be in a state where he's burning fat.
He's going to be running a few hours this week. And some people who run marathons or condition a lot might say that's not a lot, but when you're depleting your body and asking it to do more, that's the challenge. Typically, we fuel fighters up to give their body what they need. If I say, 'Hey, we need you to go on a run,' we'll fuel the body up for it, so the body wants to do it. What I told Max is, 'I'm going to be asking you to do things your body is not going to want to do.' And that's when it becomes a mental thing.
Then we have to make sure we're recovering. Ice baths, massages, stretching -- it takes time for muscles to recover. If we're running, running, running, and he's sore the day of the fight, it's going to have a negative impact.
ESPN: What did you sense is Holloway's mindset, approaching this type of weight cut?
Lockhart: Max knows what he has to do, and he's excited. ... I'm not gonna lie, I think he almost likes the amount of weight he has to lose, because it's a challenge. Max has always said he doesn't want to fight guys people think he can beat. He wants to fight the guys people think he'll lose to. When you give him a challenge, he excels. And that's the main reason I agreed to do this with him.
ESPN: What will he be eating during the next five days?
Lockhart: We'll cook his food in coconut oil, sesame oil. We'll get him seared ahi. He's from Hawaii, he'll like that. No carbs. We'll give him some spinach or something like that, but no carbs that will fuel him. We want his meat portions to be the same. Let's say I go from six ounces of chicken breast to four ounces. I may lose 40 to 60 calories, but if I increase the meat content and he's able to run an extra 20 minutes, not only did I burn those calories, but also the water attached to it.
ESPN: Ideally, what will Holloway weigh when he goes to bed on Thursday evening, the night before the weigh-in?
Lockhart: I'm hoping within four pounds of 155. We'll be doing a hot salt bath in the morning. We control the most variables with the bath.
ESPN: You said right off the bat that you won't allow this to endanger his health. How will you monitor that?
Lockhart: Say we put him in a bath, 106 degrees, and it takes him 15 minutes to crack a sweat. Then let's say we put him in for an extra 15 minutes and crank the temperature up to 107, 108 -- if he loses like a pound, and we have eight pounds to go, there's no way we're doing it.
We have a skin test, where you pull the skin and if comes down slowly and you still have a lot of weight to lose, you call it off. You test the colors of the fingernails. The eyes, obviously. We monitor his heart rate and blood pressure. We'll make sure those are good to go. My team's process is different than others. At the end of the day, I'm not gonna be like, 'You know what, I think he's good.' If he's not good, we're gonna get him the f--- out of there as soon as possible. I'm not going to let anyone get injured.

Stewart-Haas Racing believes it needed time to get over ""growing pains"" in order to have the upturn in form it is currently enjoying in the 2018 NASCAR Cup series.
SHR's switch from Chevrolet to Ford for 2017 took time to get to grips with, with the current iteration of SHR having previously had its engines and chassis supplied by Hendrick Motorsports since '09.
Its first year with Ford started with Kurt Busch's victory at the Daytona 500 and Kevin Harvick made the final four of the playoffs.
The team then continued its end of season form at the start of 2018, with Harvick winning three races in a row before Clint Bowyer added the team's fourth victory.
""For our organisation, it's been a solid year,"" said SHR's competition director Greg Zipadelli.
""Everybody has worked really hard in the off‑season, like every other team.
""But last year we were trying to figure out how to put motors in cars to make it to the racetrack, and that's not a lie. It was that bad when we switched over to Ford.
""We had some growing pains last year. And I think maybe not having the success that we expected or wanted or feel that this group of capable of, everybody worked a little harder this year.
""Everybody dug down. Everybody is working better together as a group. I feel like our whole entire company is doing better.""
When asked to pinpoint where SHR's dominance had come from, Zipadelli said: ""Obviously from an aero perspective, we've got a very strong group.
""They work hard. They're very dedicated to building great race cars.
""It's the same thing everybody works on, you work on aero, you work on horsepower, and you work on pit crews.""

With Aric Almirola (pictured above) and Kurt Busch also starting the season strongly, Zipadelli added it was ""huge"" for SHR to have four competitive cars in each race.
""I've been proud of the wins and the success we've had, but I've been more proud of the performance of all four cars so far this year,"" he said.
""When you look at them from a qualifying perspective, a finishing perspective [and] where they are as a group in points.
""We've got to figure out a way to give all four of our teams the best stuff we can and to continue to get our guys to work together and make our stuff better to where Mike [Bugarewicz, crew chief for Bowyer] shows up at the racetrack and he has speed, and he can do his job.""
Zipadelli pointed to Bowyer's Martinsville win as a sign that proved that SHR had turned the corner.
""There's been weekends where they've [Bowyer and his team] have shown up and our cars didn't have the speed that they needed to, and it doesn't matter, he can't make it better at that point,"" he said.
""But when it counted, they did an awesome job.""

Donte DiVincenzo scores 31 points off the bench as Villanova defeats Michigan 79-62 for its second title in three years and third in school history. (2:18)
SAN ANTONIO -- Phil Booth laughed about it on Sunday when the topic was brought up.
When he arrived at Villanova four years ago, the knock on the Wildcats was that they couldn't win in March. They had been sent home the first weekend of the NCAA tournament in five straight appearances, despite earning a top-two seed in three of those five tourney trips.
""Just how the tournament works, you know?"" Booth told ESPN.
After Monday night, the narrative is much different: Villanova is the best program in college basketball.

With 136 wins in the past four seasons, Wright has Villanova firmly entrenched as a national power and has established himself as one of the elite coaches in the game. And the Wildcats show no signs of slowing down.
That Villanova was celebrating a national title felt right in a season in which very little else did.
We went from 68 teams to Villanova as the NCAA tournament champion. How does the field stack up for next season? Presenting your first look at the best of the best for the 2018-19 season.
Villanova won its second national championship in three years on Monday, dominating Michigan for most of the final 30 minutes en route to a 79-62 victory.
""I don't think they were saying that when I first got to Nova,"" Booth said Sunday of the possibility of being considered the best program in the country. ""To have that being [said] is something really cool to hear.""
Monday's game capped a quietly dominant season from Villanova. The Wildcats haven't had a single-digit margin of victory since February. They are the fourth team to win all of its NCAA tournament games by double digits. They lost just four times all season and never by more than eight points.
The victory also caps an absurd five-year run for the Wildcats. Two national championships, four Big East titles, 165 wins, three 1-seeds and five top-two seeds. We haven't seen a run such as this in college basketball in a long, long time.
It's now solidified: No other program has had this sort of success over the past several years.
""If they don't say that, they're dumb -- point-blank,"" former star Josh Hart said. ""If you don't give Villanova the respect it deserves now -- it's a blue blood program. If you don't think this is one of the best five-year runs in modern NCAA [history], it's crazy.""
""Two titles in the last three years speaks for itself,"" former Villanova guard Ryan Arcidiacono said. ""We should be mentioned up there.""
Jay Wright told ESPN earlier this season that he never talks about wins and losses within the program. But maybe after this run is over, he'll have some fun with it.
""If when we're done, and somebody says, 'Hey, there was a run, where you ...' I'll be like, 'That was really cool. That was really cool.'""
Monday night had all the staples of a classic Villanova win. Nothing takes the Wildcats out of what they want to do.
They started off slowly, with Michigan coming out ready for a fight and taking it to Villanova from the opening tip. It didn't matter. A 30-9 run that spanned parts of both halves essentially buried Michigan.
The Wildcats' 3-pointers weren't falling early. It didn't matter. As they've shown more and more the past few years, they're not as ""live by the 3, die by the 3"" as they once were. They got to the rim, got to the free throw line and got baskets in transition.
Jalen Brunson struggled after scoring Villanova's first four points. It didn't matter. Donte DiVincenzo had one of the most impressive performances of the NCAA tournament, coming off the bench to score 31 points, including 18 in the first half when Villanova couldn't get anything going offensively. Likely lottery pick Mikal Bridges found his shot in the second half, making multiple 3-pointers late in the game to sustain Villanova's run.
It was three of the oft-repeated mantras of Wright's program playing out in real time: Attitude. Together. Villanova basketball for 40 minutes.
""It's our culture. I always go back to our culture,"" former Villanova forward Kris Jenkins said after the game. ""There's so many great programs, so many great coaches, but I think our culture is what sets us apart.""
The team that doesn't rattle -- ever -- showed some emotion and turned what was a tight, physical game into a blowout.
The stoic Villanova Wildcats were ready to respond after getting punched in the mouth, and they earned their second title in three years -- along with the title of best program in college basketball.
It's a far cry from the narratives of five years ago.
""It's safe to say they can never say that again,"" Jenkins said of the ""can't win in March"" notion. ""They can put that one to rest.""

Michael Collins observes how calm Tiger Woods appears as he seeks his first win at Augusta since 2005. (2:06)
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- The nerves of youth, the experience that comes with age. It has seemingly always been important to have a mixture of both at the Masters.
Augusta National presents such a test when the year's first major championship arrives. Masters Tournament winners typically need a bit of seasoning, a certain course initiation before becoming comfortable around the venerable venue.
And that is why we will not discount players such as Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, Henrik Stenson, Jason Dufner, Charley Hoffman, Paul Casey and Zach Johnson from winning here this week, despite all being in their 40s.
Editor's PicksMasters 2018: Tournament news, schedule, coverage and analysisAll you need to know about the 2018 Masters Tournament, including day-by-day results and analysis from Augusta National.For the first time in a long time, Tiger Woods looking forward to Masters weekFinally, Tiger Woods enters the Masters with positive vibes, which is all he can ask for at this point.1 Related
All you need to know about the 2018 Masters Tournament, including day-by-day results and analysis from Augusta National.
Finally, Tiger Woods enters the Masters with positive vibes, which is all he can ask for at this point.
There are obviously outliers. Jordan Spieth nearly won in his first attempt in 2014 at the age of 20, then won the following year in his second. Danny Willett, who overtook Spieth in the final round two years ago at the age of 28, was playing in just his second Masters. Tiger remains the youngest winner at 21 years, 104 days (Spieth being second to him) when he won his first of four green jackets in 1997. But aside from the first two Masters in 1934 and 1935, only one player has won in his first attempt -- Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 at the age of 27.
""It's the only major we play year in and year out at the same venue, and experience is more of a factor [at Augusta] than anywhere else,'' said Mickelson, who won for the first time in nearly five years when he claimed the WGC-Mexico Championship last month. ""Knowing how to hit the shots, knowing how to lay back, how to attack, is a big part of being successful.""
There are 17 players in this year's 87-player field who are 40 or older, including Ian Poulter, who claimed the last spot by winning the Houston Open on Sunday. Of those 17, nine are still in their 40s.
And yet the idea that the most-seasoned players have an advantage is often offset by an understandable decline in skill as they age. So, while a victory by the likes of Mickelson, 47, or Woods, 42, or Casey, 40, would hardly be a surprise, it would be a statistical anomaly. In the 81 previous Masters, the tournament has been won by someone 40 or older only six times, and the last was 20 years ago, when Mark O'Meara, 41, won the first of two major titles that year.
The others are also Hall of Famers: Ben Hogan, 40 (1953); Sam Snead, 41 (1954); Gary Player, 42 (1978); Jack Nicklaus, 46 (1986); and Ben Crenshaw, 43 (1995).
""To me, it's like a double-edged sword,"" said defending champion Sergio Garcia, who was 37 when he won in his 18th Masters start, the record for number of attempts at a first victory. ""I think that experience is obviously important because you know some of the places that you can hit it, and you know some of the places where the ball is going to run one way or another.
""At the same time,"" Garcia continued, ""the beautiful thing about not knowing too much about the course is that you haven't had too many bad experiences where you hit in the water here or in the trees there or something like. There's not as much scar tissues. But at the end of the day, for a course like Augusta, it is important to know and have a little bit of experience there and know exactly what's going on.""
Casey firmly believes ""the 40-somethings could take on anybody"" this week. He won the Valspar Championship last month, with Woods finishing a shot back. He also noted the duel just two years ago between Mickelson and Stenson at The Open, in which Stenson prevailed.
""Without question, I take that as a really positive sign,"" Casey said. ""It's very different now. Tiger is back, but the players I'm competing against are a very different group of players than those I was competing against earlier in my career. It's not easier.""
Yes, the likes of Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Spieth and Justin Rose -- the top five players in the world -- present a stout challenge. Casey, at No. 13 in the world, is the highest-ranked 40-something, but he has never won a major championship. Stenson is 14th and Mickelson is 18th.
""If you're going to be honest with yourself, you don't work anywhere near as hard at 40 as you did at 25,"" said two-time U.S. Open winner and ESPN golf analyst Andy North. ""The only tournaments you probably really care about when you get to 40 are the majors, and that's why you do see these guys, the older guys, compete. ... There's a lot to it, but this group of 40-plus guys have a chance to be in the mix and have a chance to win. I wouldn't be a bit surprised at all if we had a guy in his 40s win.""
Nicklaus is the oldest champion at age 46, but Raymond Floyd was 49 when he lost in a playoff against Nick Faldo in 1990. Nicklaus also tied for seventh in 1987 at age 47 and tied for sixth at age 58 in 1998. And there have been plenty of other close calls. Mickelson, who won his third Masters at age 39 in 2010, has had a second- and a third-place finish since. Angel Cabrera was 43 when he lost in a playoff to Adam Scott in 2013. Kenny Perry was 48 when he lost in a playoff to Cabrera in 2009.
""Golf is a game where you can draw on experience and so forth,'' Stenson said. ""We play these courses a lot of times, and you make some mistakes, and you try and rectify that. When you've got younger players coming up, if they're playing here for the first time or the second time, they haven't maybe got the experience on a tough golf course, and they make one or two mistakes that's going to cost them a lot. So I think that plays a big part.""
You can be sure that Mickelson and Woods -- who have seven Masters between them -- in no way feel that their age is a factor. They believe it is an asset. ""I just know that place so well, have so many good memories,'' Woods said.
""I truly believe some of my best golf is in front of me,"" said 41-year-old Zach Johnson, who won the Masters 11 years ago and The Open at St. Andrews in 2015. ""There is no reason I can't have more success.""
The numbers might be against one of them wearing the green jacket on Sunday, but having experience on their side at Augusta National can be an odds-enhancing asset.

It's hard to watch Tiger Woods play golf right now.
I don't mean that in the sense that it's hard to watch him, at 42 years old, try to recapture the glories of his astonishing, but now distant, prime. Quite the contrary. Yes, watching and writing about Tiger at his peak was a thrill. But I've grown to believe watching Tiger wrestle with time, seeing him relearning the rhythms of his body as he attempts to summon one last run at Jack Nicklaus' majors record, has a chance to be the most enjoyable era of his career.
You might disagree -- because who in their right mind wouldn't prefer to have the 2000 Tiger or 2006 Tiger back? -- but consider this: Tiger was never meant to play the underdog. He has always been golf's Goliath, a dominant force who didn't beat other players; he steamrolled them. It was awe-inspiring, but, at the height of his powers, it sometimes felt like rooting for a corporation. Yet, here we are, the week of the 2018 Masters, with a healthy Tiger having a realistic chance to chase an unexpected, improbable finish.
When I say it's hard to watch him play, I mean it literally. You have to push and elbow your way through a gallery that feels more like a crowded street bazaar. You have to crane your neck and invade someone's personal space just to get a glimpse of him on the tee as he mulls whether to hit driver or 3-wood. Often, right when you finally get a sliver of daylight and an unobstructed view, a person near you will thrust their cellphone into your line of sight, camera rolling, because he or she is desperate to take home a pixelated souvenir.
This phenomenon isn't limited to a particular demographic. People of all ages, races, tax brackets, and parts of the country are back by his side, and most of them cannot resist shouting encouragement to a man who almost never acknowledges it. Spend a day following Tiger around and you can't help but notice that one word pops up over and over again. Frat boys, socialites, finance bros, lawyers, hippies, soccer moms, biker dudes and little kids all shout out some version of it as he strolls by, in a way that feels like a mixture of reassurance and longing. 
It's the word ""still.""
I still love you, Tiger!
You're still the man, El Tigre!
I still believe!
He is still the magnet we cannot help but feel drawn to.
 
How did we get here? It was barely more than a year ago that we were watching dashcam footage of him, on the side of the highway, overmedicated to the point he couldn't stand on one foot or speak without slurring his words, looking broken and lost, physically and emotionally. Now he's crushing 330-yard drives, twirling his clubs, walking in putts. How?  
 
I've spent the entire spring thinking about him, watching him, reading about him and studying him. I'm hardly alone. An entire book about him was just released. TV ratings are soaring again, and we all know he's the reason. Even players who grew up watching him can't help but feel as if something from a previous era has returned.  
""He moves the needle. He's the reason probably why the attendance this week was as high as it was,"" Justin Thomas said after winning the Honda Classic in a playoff, a tournament where Woods finished in 12th place. ""They weren't coming out here to watch Luke List and Justin Thomas. They were coming out here to watch Tiger, so I don't blame them. I'd go watch him, too, instead of me.""

When he hit balls into the stands, we pretended he was doing it on purpose. When he used his putter from the rough instead of a wedge, we claimed it was strategic. Those rounds were more like a sad parade, and people wanted to look away as much as they wanted to watch. This is different. Maybe it won't reach the fever pitch of Tigermania in 2000, but it's still early. I was a cynic for the longest time, convinced a genuine Tiger comeback was a ridiculous pipe dream. I was ready to move forward, the same way my parents' generation was forced to move on from Jack and Arnie nearly half a century ago. It's the natural cycle of life, and sports. If you try to hold on to the past forever, you end up wallowing in nostalgia and missing the joys of the present: Why not transition to teaching, Tiger? You can't tie your shoes, how are you ever going to compete in the Masters?
Now I'm on the cusp of believing again. If he wins this week, Augusta National should replace the pimento cheese sandwiches with crow. I'll happily down a whole plate of them.
Who cares if no one has ever overcome the chipping yips, or won five majors in their 40s, or rebuilt their game after a spinal fusion? Who else has done the other things Tiger has done?
He is living out a classic, irresistible narrative trope. A prodigy comes of age and reaches the greatest of heights only to eventually squander some of his promise. He is humbled by time and injuries, plagued by doubt. In the final act, when nearly everyone has written him off, he gets his shot at redemption. It's a cliché, sure, but it's still impossible to resist.

With Tiger in contention, more people watched the final round of the 2018 Valspar Championship (6.9 million average views per minute) than last year's final round of the U.S. Open, The Open and the PGA Championship. Even if Tiger is not Goliath, the rating is a pretty good testament to the Tiger Effect. 
But if you have the chance to see Tiger in person in the coming months -- or years, assuming his spinal fusion holds up -- don't pass it up. Fork over your money, fight your way to the front of the rope line and soak in the circus. Hold your breath as he mashes a drive and bends over to snatch his tee out of the ground before the ball reaches its apex, already certain he's found the fairway.
There are so few experiences in sports that truly live up to their hype, but here is one: Standing in deathly silence as Tiger begins his backswing, and then feeling a wave of sound reverberate off your body a half second after the ball leaves the club and the gallery roars to life. I was standing a few feet from him earlier this year at the Genesis Open when he hit a 4-iron out of the rough on the 11th hole that I keep replaying in my mind, because it seemed as if it defied physics. He hit it low enough to keep the ball under a tree branch 30 yards in front of him; then, inexplicably, his shot began to rise and simultaneously curve to the left, almost as if he was a Jedi controlling it with his mind. It mattered little that he ended up making a bogey on the hole. His game had a heartbeat. 
The difference between watching Tiger on television and experiencing it in person might be as vast as the gap between watching Prince play guitar on YouTube compared with sitting front row at one of his concerts. How many of us would jump at one more chance -- perhaps never seized while they were alive -- to see Prince or Tom Petty play music?
No matter what you have thought of him over the years, Tiger is the sports equivalent.

She didn't walk so much as shuffle, holding the arm of Glenn Greenspan, Tiger's publicist, as they navigated the crowds following the 14-time major winner.
Kultida, her face mostly hidden behind a large pink hat and sunglasses, couldn't see much of her son through the sea of people constantly jostling for position, but that seemed unimportant. Just being there was enough. So much ink has been spilled about Tiger's rich and complicated relationship with his father, Earl, that his mom has become something of a forgotten figure in the narrative of his public life. So many of the people who were part of Tiger's ascent -- Butch Harmon, Steve Williams, Hank Haney, Mark O'Meara, Sean Foley, Charles Barkley -- have essentially been phased out of his life for various reasons, excommunicated for sins big or small. The one constant has been his mom. She was the parent who gave him a ride to practice every day as a kid, who taught him to take no prisoners on the course and never forget a slight off of it. 
She doesn't grant interviews these days, and hasn't in years. And Tiger typically deflects personal questions like Bill Russell swatting away a layup in his prime, but I took a chance and asked him whether this was the first time his mother had seen him play in some time.
 

""Yeah, she misses it,"" Woods said. ""She's seen me go through the struggles, and for her only child to go through those struggles was a little rough on her, so she's very proud of me getting back out there and playing. She's very excited about it.""

The truth is, he didn't. He just wanted to try to play again. If he stank, so be it. He didn't care how it made you feel. If you understand that, you have a better understanding of what makes Tiger Woods tick. ""I missed it so much,"" he said. ""I used to bring my son out [to the course] and he'd play and I couldn't. I could barely ride in a golf cart. I missed my buddies calling me up and saying 'Hey, let's go play a quick nine,' and me saying 'OK, let's go.'""
It's easy to forget, now, what he said while serving as an assistant captain for the United States at the Presidents Cup in September. He could definitely see a scenario in which he never returned to play professional golf. ""I don't know what my future holds for me,"" he told reporters then. ""As I've told you guys, I'm hitting 60-yard shots.""
Still, he continued to rehab, his back getting stronger each week, his brain calculating a new way to swing, until the unlikely became a reality. He was healthy enough to look, for the moment, like an average PGA Tour player. Even if that's all it ever was, that was OK. ""I have to just enjoy all of this, because at one point, that wasn't, man, that wasn't even a thought,"" Woods said during the Honda Classic. ""I didn't ever even think about playing out here.""
We sports fans have a strange habit of trying to rush our heroes to the exit when they get a little gray around their temples, probably so we never have to see them look mortal. As long as they're young, we feel young. We cringe when we think about Willie Mays in a Mets uniform, falling down in the outfield as he's chasing a fly ball, but we never pause to consider it from Mays' perspective. What if the great ones don't care if their late-career stumbles besmirch our memories? What if they just want to fight to play another day?

Even Tiger couldn't resist a smirk when reporters started asking him at the Arnold Palmer Invitational whether he was going to be satisfied with anything other than a victory. ""You guys are asking different questions than you did when I first came back, and that wasn't that long ago. That was two months ago,"" Woods said. ""The narrative has completely flipped from how you guys ask me questions. I want to just remind you guys that it wasn't that long ago that you were asking a different set of questions. I enjoy just playing again. After what I've been through? Playing feels good.""
Watching Tiger this spring reminded me of an old Roger Federer quote. The 20-time Grand Slam winner uttered it before his recent resurgence, when it seemed as if he was being nudged toward retirement by just about everyone, particularly the media. There are very few athletes in the world who can realistically understand what it might feel like to be Tiger Woods, but Federer is one of them. There are reasons beyond their individual greatness or their shared corporate sponsors that they've always been friendly. They understand each other. 
""Sometimes you're just happy playing,"" Federer said. ""Some people, some media, don't understand that it's OK just to play tennis and enjoy it. They always think you have to win everything, it always needs to be a success story, and if it's not, obviously, what is the point? Maybe you have to go back and think, 'Why have I started playing tennis? Because I just like it.' It's actually sort of a dream hobby that became somewhat of a job. Some people just don't get that, ever.""
It might sound like a stretch, but there are more parallels between Tiger and Prince and Petty than you might realize.
Like those two iconic musicians, Tiger spent years relying on prescription medication to help him cope with debilitating physical pain. For the three of them, it seemed to be the only way they thought they could continue doing their job, performing in front of millions of fans.
With Prince and Petty, their discomfort was mostly a secret, known only to their closest friends and associates. But with Tiger, it was harder to hide. It became part of the legend, a testament to his toughness. All those times we wrote hosannas about his willingness to play through discomfort -- like the time he said he popped his wrist bone back into place during the final round of the 2015 Masters -- feel a little uncomfortable in retrospect. Did his chipping issues, which he attributed to the pain in his back and his inability to practice, have something to do with how much medication he was using? At the Arnold Palmer Invitational, he said he didn't even realize how much day-to-day pain he was living with until he got his back fixed. Agony was just a way of life. For close to six months, he said, someone had to help him get out of bed every day.
""Coming back and playing golf was never in my thoughts,"" Tiger said. ""It was just 'How do I get away from this pain? How do I live life again?'""
Only Tiger and his doctors know how heavily he relied on opioids such as Vicodin or Dilaudid, two drugs that showed up in the toxicology report when he crashed his Mercedes-Benz on a Florida highway last May and was found asleep at the wheel with two bent rims and two flat tires. Tiger spent nearly a month in rehab to address his issues -- always stopping short of calling it an addiction -- and assured us upon release that he was fine. Prince and Petty couldn't control theirs, and now they're no longer with us.
One of the struggles of living your life in a fishbowl of fame is there are so few people who can understand your experiences, your anxieties, but when Tiger was in rehab, he got a call from someone who had experienced a remarkably similar rise and fall: swimmer Michael Phelps. They talked, according to friends, for nearly two hours. A friendship gradually began to form. Phelps, who spent eight weeks in a rehab facility treating his depression and substance abuse, saw in Tiger a version of himself, a lost soul crying out for help. Phelps understood, better than anyone, that you didn't magically cure your issues. You learned to keep wrestling with them, and hopefully winning, forever.
Sometimes I wonder how close Tiger came to losing his life that night, or, equally scary, how close he came to taking someone else's life. It's an upsetting thought, a possibility we mostly want to ignore or move beyond so we can hurry up and get back to golf, but I wonder whether the same hypothetical horrors ever enter his own mind.
Does he now see every day he has from the perspective of a man who nearly lost everything? A recent quote he posted to his own website suggests as much. 
 
""I got a second chance on life,"" he said. ""I am a walking miracle.""

Yet, there he was cracking dirty jokes with reporters at the Farmers Insurance Open while standing on the cliffs of Torrey Pines, staring down at dolphins as he waited to hit his tee shot. There he was at the Genesis, grinning on the range with Phil Mickelson, whatever animosity that once existed between them now forgotten. The man who once refused to make eye contact with his playing partners for entire rounds could be seen patting Rory McIlroy on the back after good shots, then asking McIlroy for advice on how to hit his TaylorMade driver.
""The old Tiger used to walk onto the range with a presence that would intimidate people,"" Padraig Harrington said in a February interview with the Irish Independent. ""This was not the old Tiger. He was talking and smiling and joking and high-fiving. I had a chat with him on the range. I spent longer talking to him on the range in San Diego [than] I ever have. I think we're both at a stage where we realize, 'You know what? You've got to make an effort to enjoy what you're doing out here.'""
There was a moment at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, on the fifth hole during Tiger's final round, that seemed to confirm Harrington's conjecture. Tiger hammered a drive that went forever but landed in the rough. He was near the green, but had a gnarly lie and was faced with an awkward chip. All he could do was try to run the ball up the bank and get it within 20 feet from the hole. He hit a decent chip, but it clipped a sprinkler head on the way up the bank -- an unfortunate, but not unheard of, break -- and stopped just on the fringe, leaving Tiger with an almost impossible birdie putt. Judging the speed would be nothing but a guess. Tiger hit it too hard and knew it right away. He immediately began walking after the putt in semi-disgust when the ball, like a magnet, began tracking toward the cup and hit the flagstick dead center. It stopped a half inch from the hole.
It wasn't the shot that surprised me, because he's hit hundreds like it. What surprised me was Tiger's reaction. The crowd was groaning, but Woods was laughing. I'd almost call it giggling. As he walked to clean up his par putt, he couldn't stop. ""I don't know if I've ever seen a reaction like that from Tiger Woods,"" NBC announcer Dan Hicks said on the broadcast.
There were moments of intensity and frustration still to come. Birdies, fist pumps, putts lipping out and a drive he would smash wildly out of bounds because -- he candidly said after the round -- he couldn't commit to making the swing he wanted.
But that moment when he couldn't stop laughing, in the middle of a round when he was in contention, was refreshing in its own uniqueness. That too is Tiger Woods.

Remember that commercial? That's how Nike announced Tiger was turning professional in 1996. Tiger didn't write the ad copy, of course -- it was advertising titan Jim Riswold -- but he loved the sentiment behind it. ""I feel it's a message that has been long awaited because it's very true,"" Tiger said that year, in an interview on ABC News' ""Nightline."" ""Being a person who is, I guess, how could you say, non-wanted, I had experienced that. The Nike campaign is just telling the truth.""
It's easy to forget what a controversial statement it was at the time, how quickly golf writers insisted Nike and Tiger produce the name of a single course that wouldn't have him. (They could not.) Thinking back on it, I couldn't help but think about another great athlete who grew up in California and had a multiracial background, an athlete who seemed, briefly, as if he was going to change his sport: NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
How would we view Tiger now if he continued to talk about race in ways that made a lot of people uncomfortable or angry? It's what his father, Earl, seemed to want, to get in people's face and face some difficult truths. Would the backlash have been as severe as what Kaepernick has faced? Or were Tiger's skills so transcendent he eventually would have been seen as another Muhammad Ali, perhaps initially divisive, then almost universally revered later in life?
I got a second chance on life. I am a walking miracle.

There are no real answers to any of those questions. Tiger never quite felt comfortable in the role of provocateur. ""My goal all along had been that, by playing and winning golf, I could somehow help golfers, and perhaps people outside the game, be color blind,"" Tiger wrote in the book ""The 1997 Masters: My Story"" co-written with Lorne Rubenstein. ""Wouldn't that be the best situation to come out of my win, that we could see each other as people and people only?""
Over time, there became little expectation for Tiger to comment on social issues. Both he and Rory McIlroy played golf with President Donald Trump during the past year, and McIlroy was bombarded with criticism. The Northern Irishman clarified that he didn't agree with Trump's views and likely wouldn't play with him again, if asked. Tiger's two rounds with Trump (just before Christmas in 2016 and Thanksgiving weekend in 2017) received little criticism by comparison. The second time Trump and Tiger played, ""Get Out"" director Jordan Peele retweeted a video of Trump and Tiger together with the caption ""Now you're in The Sunken Place"" and the tweet went viral, but any controversy over the round quickly faded. Tiger never commented publicly on any of it. 
Over the years, he has chosen, instead, to quietly focus on making a difference through the Tiger Woods Foundation, a charity organization he and his father founded in 1996. The foundation helped set up learning labs and scholarship programs around the country to help kids in need, even if they had no connection to sports. Thousands and thousands of kids have received tutoring through the Tiger Woods Learning Lab in Anaheim, California, and nearly 100 minority students have gone to college because of the Earl Woods Scholar Program. Eighty-eight percent of the students involved in the TGR Foundation are minorities, and 85 percent of them live at or below the poverty line.
Who's to say that hasn't made an equally important impact?
After four back surgeries in four years, Tiger has had to adjust his swing. ""There are a lot of things I can't do anymore because of the nature of the [back] fusion,"" Woods said in January. ""So I'm relying on feel and my past performances.'' Stan Badz/PGA TOUR/Getty Images

He still swings with so much violence -- his spine recoiling like a Slinky that's been stretched to its limit and then let go -- I'm concerned this comeback is going to end just as its picking up steam. The last thing anyone wants is to see Tiger double over pain at the 13th tee at the Masters because he has just seen Bubba Watson drive one over the trees and carry the dogleg and his ego can't resist swinging so hard and Tiger reaches his breaking point.
Tiger had three separate microdiskectomies to relieve pain in his back and legs. After each procedure, he seemed fine at first. His comments after each procedure began to feel a bit like golf's version of the movie ""Groundhog Day."" He would state he was confident this surgery would do the trick and help him return to action. For a few months, the results looked promising, but then he would grimace climbing out of a bunker and you'd know it was just a matter of time.
Dr. Andrew Hecht, chief of spine surgery at the Mount Sinai Hospital, assures us that any concerns of Tiger reinjuring his back are unfounded. A lower lumbar spinal fusion, the fourth back surgery Tiger has undergone since 2014, might have been portrayed as a Hail Mary, but that's not the right way to look at it. Hecht didn't perform the fusion of Tiger's L5 bone and S1 bone, but he has performed it on a number of professional athletes whose names you would recognize immediately.
""The recovery from that is very successful, especially for someone who has had a previous diskectomy, because you know where the pain is coming from,"" Hecht said. ""In football or baseball or hockey, you might see a 10 or 15 percent performance decline, and that may be enough for you not to make the team again. But for a golfer, you're a team of one. Even though the swing is a very physical act, with a lot of violence and torque and twist, the chances of returning to a very high level is even better than for someone who plays a contact or collision sport.""
But what if Tiger can't resist pushing himself to the limit again and every swing in practice or in a tournament brings us closer to the end? Won't he put more pressure on other areas of his spine that will eventually fall apart? It doesn't work that way, Hecht said.
""He should be able to play as long as his physical capabilities will take him,"" Hecht said. ""What's great about this is, all of the decisions going forward are really going to be up to him. When you're pain-free, it's based on your skill again. I think his prognosis is excellent, and it's a testament to what a great athlete he is, not just as a golfer.""

They are always asking me how Jordan Spieth or Rory McIlroy are doing, whether Lydia Ko, Michelle Wie or Lexi Thompson is in contention. When we watch tournaments, or go to the driving range to whack balls, they will ask me what I think about various players. They are more familiar with Brandt Snedeker and Billy Horschel than LeBron James.
They seemed confused, though, when I mentioned this winter that I was going on the road to watch Tiger play. It dawned on me they had only a vague understanding of who that was.
 
Where do you begin? Do you have an obligation, as a father, to bring up any of his personal foibles? Or do you merely focus on the physical gifts? I started by showing them a clip of the delicate chip from Sunday at the 2005 Masters, the one that trickled down the bank on 16, the ball almost pausing on the lip of the cup, only to drop in for an improbable birdie.
When CBS' Verne Lundquist uttered the phrase I've jokingly said with my buddies a hundred times -- ""In your life, have you ever seen anything like that?"" -- I realized the answer for my kids was literally no. The answer for Tiger's kids, Sam and Charlie, is also no.
They missed all of it. Pebble Beach in 2000. The ""better than most"" putt at Sawgrass. The birdie putt on the 72nd hole at Torrey Pines. Sure, they missed the embarrassing news conference and jokes about crashing an Escalade into a fire hydrant, but they missed the fun. Even those of us who lived through them never imagined those moments would dry up as quickly as they did. Golf spoils us because you can convince yourself that, on the right weekend, a miracle will unfold for the right player, even if he's in his 50s. People would laugh if you suggested LeBron would hit a jump shot to win a championship at age 59, but Tom Watson had a putt to win The Open at that same age. Why couldn't Tiger?
Maybe that's why I feel so hopeful, watching him now. So many of us were convinced it was over, a belief that earned us no small amount of scorn from the Tiger True Believers. I recently spoke to Golf Channel analyst and occasional Tiger Woods skeptic Brandel Chamblee, and we were joking about what it's like to be on the record, as both of us are, about how a Tiger comeback was unlikely.
""You have no idea how many people come up to me and say, 'You were wrong! You were wrong!'"" Chamblee recalled. ""I just say, 'You're absolutely right. I was wrong, and very happy to be wrong.' I had no clue he would ever swing a club this fast or chip this good. If you saw that one coming, you've got powers of perception that are unreal. You should be calling the stock market.""
What's going to happen next? There is no point in making predictions. But it's possible the past was just prologue. What if he wins five more majors and they are the most memorable of all? What if it's just one more major, but it's more satisfying than any of the other 14? Whether it comes true or not, I will forever love Tiger's answer when then PBS TV host Charlie Rose asked him two years ago whether he thought he still had a chance to break Nicklaus' record.
Rose: Do you believe you'll get 18 majors?
Tiger:  To be honest with you, no. 
Rose:  You don't? 
Tiger:  No. 
Rose:  You've accepted that? 
Tiger:  I've accepted I'm going to get more.
The two men started laughing, but ... what if Tiger is right?


Another generation of golf fans -- my kids, your kids, Tiger's kids -- will get to witness some magic that seemed, not long ago, improbable. There is still time. They still might have a memory of Tiger they get to call their own.",sports

From outsiders trying to prove they belong, Villanova is now one of the blue bloods, joining an elite list of programs with at least three titles. Rece Davis tells us the story. (1:50)
SAN ANTONIO -- As Villanova players cut down the basketball nets, Kris Jenkins draped his arm around Ryan Arcidiacono and the two former Wildcats reveled in the dynasty their alma mater has created.
The Wildcats' 79-62 national championship win over Michigan on Monday night had far less drama than Villanova's epic title victory two years ago, when Jenkins hit the game-winning shot to defeat North Carolina. That 2016 buzzer-beater helped get Villanova to a place where few programs ever go.
But Monday's win has taken Jay Wright to a place few coaches ever go. Wright is just the third active coach with multiple NCAA championships and just the second coach in Division I history with four straight 30-win seasons.
Bill Self is the other, and Wright's Villanova team dismantled Kansas so thoroughly in the national semifinal here that Self sat flabbergasted on the sideline, unable to conjure an answer for the offensive balance, efficiency and depth that defines these Wildcats.

That Villanova was celebrating a national title felt right in a season in which very little else did.
We went from 68 teams to Villanova as the NCAA tournament champion. How does the field stack up for next season? Presenting your first look at the best of the best for the 2018-19 season.
Headlined by the 1972 UCLA Bruins, 80 teams have cut down the nets at an NCAA tournament. Villanova became the latest, winning its second title in three years. Where does this triumph rank all time?
So given what Wright has done at Villanova, and specifically what he has done over the past four years, you know what question comes next: Where does Wright belong in the conversation among the elite college coaches in the game?
""Hall of Famer!"" Arcidiacono said amid the celebration.
""Unanimous! He should get every vote,"" Jenkins said.
""We're a little biased, though,"" Arcidiacono chimed in.
""Two [titles] in three years?"" Jenkins said. ""Everybody said he had a monkey on his back. He couldn't do it. We won it, and then to get the second one in three years? We're a blue blood. We've got the most wins over the past four years in college basketball. That's a testament to the coaching staff, Coach Wright and the guys that he recruits.""
In many respects, college basketball teams are identifiable by their iconic coaches, from Mike Krzyzewski at Duke to Roy Williams at North Carolina to Jim Boeheim at Syracuse to Tom Izzo at Michigan State to John Calipari at Kentucky to Self at Kansas.
""Everybody said he had a monkey on his back. He couldn't do it. We won it, and then to get the second one in three years? We're a blue blood. We've got the most wins over the past four years in college basketball. That's a testament to the coaching staff, Coach Wright and the guys that he recruits.""
Kris Jenkins
Wright has more national championships now than Boeheim, Calipari, Self and Izzo, and he has his program rolling in a way that seemed hard to fathom when he took the job in 2001. Mike Nardi has had a front-row seat for nearly all of it. Nardi was part of Wright's second recruiting class at Villanova, and the hard sell at that point was about restoring the program to its former glory.
But to envision what Villanova is now, a program with 136 wins in four years? Just a few years into his tenure, Wright had to deal with NCAA sanctions after players improperly used an access code to make unauthorized calls. Plus, Villanova had been average at best in his first three seasons, with zero NCAA tournament appearances. Fans started to get antsy, and some questioned whether he was the right coach for the job.
Wright has previously acknowledged that he knew he was on the hot seat going into the 2004-05 season. But then the Wildcats started winning, making NCAA tournaments and eventually the 2009 Final Four, a building block that helped get the Wildcats to this point.
""Just starting the program from scratch, obviously the tradition was there but regenerating the energy and getting us back to that winning tradition and putting guys on the floor that would play hard every night and defend ... it was only a matter of time that something like this may happen,"" said Nardi, who now serves as the Wildcats' director of basketball operations.
Nardi got a business degree from Villanova and played professionally overseas. But when it came time to figure out what he wanted to do once his playing career was finished, he decided to get into coaching. Now here he is, back with Wright, part of a program that has figured out a formula that works for the Wildcats.
It isn't a formula that works for everyone, mind you.
""You can take guys like him, guys like me, turn them into national champions who aren't highly recruited, turn them into NBA players and develop them,"" said former Wildcat and current Los Angeles Laker Josh Hart, as he stood arm in arm with Villanova guard Mikal Bridges. ""That's what it takes to be a great coach. He's not a big one-and-done guy. He doesn't get the best players in the country that if you put three of them together you're going to win 25 games easily. He takes guys who are under-recruited, talented guys, high-character guys, and helps transform them into great basketball players.""
Villanova guard Phil Booth offered his take.
""Everybody just sees cool Jay on the court, but how much he really cares about the players on this team shows a lot,"" Booth said. ""He develops players, he really demands you to be the best player you can be. A lot of players came here and have one skill. They can shoot or score. He'll make you a defender, he'll make you a good passer, he'll make you a great rebounder. He does it all for you.""
Now Wright has gotten Villanova to a point where players demand the bar to be set higher, where the young guys who watched Jenkins and Arcidiacono push themselves to become champions in their own right. Villanova should return the bulk of its team next season, so there will be more time to debate where Wright ranks among his peers. Perhaps he adds another title next season.
Once summer rolls around, though, there won't be any mention of the 30-win seasons or the national championships or whether Villanova has the best coach in America.
The Wildcats will start all over, with the same catch-and-shoot drills they run every season.
""He never takes his foot off the gas,"" said Villanova guard and Final Four most outstanding player Donte DiVincenzo. ""He never thinks just because we had a 30-win season, the next year is just going to be easy. Whenever that happens, we go back to work and we never want to stay on top of a mountain. We go up on top of a mountain. We get up there, and then we're going to go back down and climb the bigger one.""

Have you caught Shohei Ohtani fever yet? After months of anticipation, we got our first regular-season look at the Angels' two-way star against major league competition, as Ohtani DH'd twice and then went six innings on the mound during L.A.'s season-opening series with the Oakland A's.
Now that Ohtani's quest is unfolding, we asked ESPN's David Schoenfield and Sam Miller to weigh in with their early -- emphasis on early -- thoughts after watching him in action.
Which is the real Ohtani? The one who struggled this spring or the one who showed flashes of brilliance during Opening Week? 
Sam Miller: If by ""struggled this spring"" we're asking if he's a Double-A-caliber pitcher who will hit .125 in the majors, the answer was always going to be the other option. Ohtani has tremendous physical skills and has succeeded against high-level Japanese competition in large samples. A few games that don't count wouldn't make you doubt any of that.
Editor's PicksShould Shohei Ohtani stay a two-way player? Exactly 100 years ago, the Red Sox faced the same question with Babe RuthWe've seen Ohtani both hit and pitch. But is that the best path forward? Boston faced the same question in 1918. Using historical data and true tales, we present a fictional memo on The Babe from a not-yet-established analytics department.Real or Not: Shohei Ohtani provides a taste of why the hype was legitAfter an underwhelming spring sapped months of anticipation, the two-way phenom dazzled with overpowering stuff to deliver his first MLB win.1 Related
We've seen Ohtani both hit and pitch. But is that the best path forward? Boston faced the same question in 1918. Using historical data and true tales, we present a fictional memo on The Babe from a not-yet-established analytics department.
After an underwhelming spring sapped months of anticipation, the two-way phenom dazzled with overpowering stuff to deliver his first MLB win.
Of course, if the question is ""will he show flashes of brilliance?"" -- that's begging the real question. We know he'll show flashes. His tools are too good not to. The question is whether he will have the stamina, the depth of skills and the ability to adjust that will allow those flashes to turn into a well-rounded star over the course of a long season and career. One week doesn't answer that. For now, I'll stick with ""shrug, but I'm excited!""
David Schoenfield: There's a reason every team wanted this guy, and we finally saw why on Sunday. Ohtani dominated in Japan -- he had a 1.86 ERA in his last healthy season there in 2016 -- because he has ace-level stuff. He struggled with throwing strikes in spring training, and some of that might simply have been rust after he didn't pitch much in 2017 because of an ankle injury, plus adapting to a slightly different baseball. The fastball command might still be a work in progress, and his slider wasn't always sharp, but the splitter is deadly, and he showed great composure in settling down after Matt Chapman's three-run homer.
Which of his tools has impressed you the most so far? 
Miller: The ability to get swinging strikes. He got 18 of them in his first start, which, by comparison, is more than Justin Verlander got in any start last year. Making major league batters swing and miss is hard to fake, even on a pitcher's best day.
Schoenfield: You know, his most impressive tool might be the one he'll use the least: his speed. During his DH outing on Opening Day, he hit one routine ground ball up the middle and nearly beat the throw. The man can fly, with Keith Law giving him an 80 speed grade on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. His raw power is 70. The point is Ohtani might be the best athlete in the majors, which bodes well for his ability to not just maximize his talent on the mound but also hit well enough to keep earning playing time at DH.
Which of his tools are you most concerned about so far? 
Miller: As a DH, Ohtani is going to have to hit a lot to stand out. As a pitcher, he'll have to stand out as a DH to justify the extra strain a two-way role puts on him. Five at-bats are certainly not enough to judge his hitting -- and he did hit the ball hard, albeit on the ground -- but after the bad spring, after some critical evaluations from anonymous scouts, after seeing the challenges other Japanese hitters have had transitioning to the majors, it's not at all obvious that he has that kind of offensive ceiling, especially if it has to develop in a part-time role with lots of other distractions and physical demands.
Schoenfield: The same one that most scouts are skeptical about: his hit tool. After his rough spring at the plate, he appeared to consciously shorten his swing in the opener, which resulted in four ground balls to the right side (plus a strikeout). One bounced through for a hit, but to get to his power, Ohtani is going to have to prove that he can handle the hard stuff inside.
Which is more likely for Ohtani in 2018: hitting 20 home runs or winning 10 games?
Miller: Winning 10 games, easily.
Schoenfield: Winning 10 games. Even if the Angels stick to a six-man rotation all season, he should get 25 or 26 starts. The key will be keep his pitch counts low enough, like he did Sunday, for him to remain in the game for six or seven innings to get those decisions.
Which is more likely: Ohtani's 2018 features a stint in the minors or Ohtani's 2018 ends with a Rookie of the Year award?
Schoenfield: Rookie of the Year. After his spring performance, I suggested that the Angels had to consider starting him in the minors. His first start showed why that won't be necessary. There's always the chance he loses complete command of his fastball and has to be sent down, but he's probably here to stay, and he's certainly capable of a 3-WAR season just on the mound. Without any other obvious Rookie of the Year favorites in the American League, he could be the winner.
Miller: Rookie of the Year award. Ohtani is certainly one of the Angels' 10 best players, and that's probably conservative.
What is a 2018 stat line -- hitter/pitcher combined -- that would make Ohtani's rookie season a success, and will he get there? 
Miller: 130 innings with a 3.80 ERA and a .770 OPS in 200 or so plate appearances. If he stays healthy, he should get there, though I wouldn't be shocked by an OPS 150 points higher or lower.
Schoenfield: The Angels need him to produce on the mound. We have no idea what kind of patience Mike Scioscia will extend to Ohtani at the plate, so I think the success will be determined mostly by his pitching performance. Yu Darvish went 16-9 with a 3.90 ERA his first season with the Rangers, and though Ohtani won't pitch 191 innings like Darvish did, I think he can beat that ERA.

Marcellus Wiley says Le'Veon Bell will have to wait for his money since most NFL deals do not get done until a deadline is approaching. (1:32)
Elite player trades and a fast-spinning quarterback carousel have made this NFL free-agency period especially compelling.
This 32-team review features insights from coaches, executives and other league insiders on all the big moves after Marcus Peters, Ndamukong Suh, Kirk Cousins, Alex Smith, Jarvis Landry and others found new homes.
Some of the teams receiving high marks from fans and media didn't fare quite as well here. That included a couple of the teams that made the biggest splashes.

ARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN | CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND | JAC | KC | LAC | LAR | MIA | MIN | NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | OAK | PHI | PIT | SF | SEA | TB | TEN | WAS
The Cardinals are the only team in the league guaranteed to have both a new head coach and new primary starting quarterback for 2018. They weren't serious players in the Kirk Cousins sweepstakes, and of the viable alternatives in the veteran market, none had significant connections to new Cardinals offensive coordinator Mike McCoy.
""If there are any quarterbacks who fit McCoy's system, I will give them credit in that Sam Bradford and Mike Glennon fit what McCoy wants,"" an exec said. ""You have to be a veteran and extremely smart to understand that offense, which is basically the Peyton Manning offense where you do a whole lot at the line of scrimmage, especially with protections.""
Finding a quarterback in the draft could be tough with Arizona slotted 15th in the order.
""Bradford-Glennon is not ideal, but you could do a lot worse,"" an insider said. ""What they really need is for David Johnson to have a Todd Gurley-type season that makes everyone around him look better, and that could happen.""

In a game with 15 lead changes and 20 ties, Boston comes out on top over Eastern Conference foe Toronto, 110-99. (1:03)
With Saturday's win over the top-seeded Toronto Raptors, the Boston Celtics are making things interesting atop the Eastern Conference.
Editor's PicksRank 'em! Week 25 NBA Power RankingsWe've unveiled our rankings for Week 25 in the NBA. How'd we do? Let us know by re-ranking our 1-30 list!
We've unveiled our rankings for Week 25 in the NBA. How'd we do? Let us know by re-ranking our 1-30 list!
The Celtics have pieced together six straight wins without leading scorer Kyrie Irving and now sit within two games of the Raptors. The rivals meet for the final time on Wednesday in Toronto in a game that will surely help decide who gets home-court advantage throughout the East playoffs.
Every week throughout the regular season, our panel (ESPN's Kevin Arnovitz, Amin Elhassan and Ramona Shelburne, The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears and FiveThirtyEight's Chris Herring) will rank the league's 30 teams from top to bottom, with research notes on each team provided by ESPN Stats & Information.
Previous rankings: Week 24 | 23 | 22 | 21 | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1
1. Houston Rockets
2017-18 record: 62-15
The Rockets' loss on Sunday snapped an 11-game run, their third double-digit winning streak of the season. According to Elias Sports Bureau research, the Rockets are the sixth team in NBA history -- and first since the 2011-12 Spurs -- to have three double-digit winning streaks in a single season (none had four such streaks). Two of the previous five won the NBA title in that same season (1970-71 Bucks, 1999-2000 Lakers). -- Troy Perlowitz
2. Toronto Raptors
2017-18 record: 55-21
After tying their franchise record with 11 straight wins, the Raptors have gone just 3-4 since. The struggles can be tied to the defense, as Toronto has allowed opponents to shoot 49.4 percent from the field since March 16, the second worst in the NBA over that span. -- Matt Williams
3. Golden State Warriors
2017-18 record: 56-21
What can the Warriors expect when Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are on the court together without Stephen Curry? In 329 minutes together, the trio has outscored opponents by 9.2 points per 100 possessions, which is down from 13.3 points per 100 possessions with Curry on the court. One slight concern lies with 3-pointers, as Golden State has shot 45 percent from beyond the arc with each of the Big Four on the court. Without Curry in the mix, that percentage drops to 33 percent. -- Matt Williams
4. Boston Celtics
2017-18 record: 53-23
Brad Stevens has bolstered his case for Coach of the Year during the Celtics' winning streak without Irving. During the six-game streak, Boston has had four different leading scorers and faced four teams currently in the playoff picture. In that span, the Celtics are shooting 48 percent from 3-point territory, best in the NBA. -- Vincent Johnson
5. Portland Trail Blazers
2017-18 record: 48-29
Al-Farouq Aminu has been one of the best 3-point shooters from the corners, where he is shooting 48.3 percent this season, the sixth-highest percentage in the NBA among players with at least 75 such attempts. -- Jose De Leon
6. Cleveland Cavaliers
2017-18 record: 47-30
The Cavs have nine wins in their past 11 games, led by LeBron James nearly averaging a triple-double since the All-Star break. Speaking of triple-doubles, James pulled off his 17th of the season Sunday. The grand total for the other seven players with a triple-double in their 15th season: 12, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. -- James Jackson
7. Philadelphia 76ers
2017-18 record: 46-30
The 76ers are going to miss Joel Embiid, who is out following surgery to repair an orbital bone fracture around his left eye. When Embiid is on the court this season, Philadelphia has outscored opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions. With their All-Star center off the court, the 76ers are outscored by 3.0 points per 100 possessions. -- Matt Williams
8. San Antonio Spurs
2017-18 record: 45-32
Gregg Popovich isn't sure when -- or if -- Kawhi Leonard will return this season. Like most of this campaign, San Antonio has done well with its available pieces, winning eight of the past 10 games. Over that stretch, LaMarcus Aldridge is averaging 28.8 points while shooting 57 percent and grabbing 9.0 rebounds per game, keeping the Spurs on track for their 21st consecutive playoff appearance. -- James Jackson
9. Oklahoma City Thunder
2017-18 record: 45-33
Though they beat the Pelicans on Sunday, the Thunder are limping into the playoffs. They're 2-4 in their past six games, with each loss against teams over .500. Russell Westbrook would need 57 rebounds and 28 assists in his final four games (assuming he plays every game) to average another triple-double for the season, and OKC will need all the stat-stuffing he can muster. -- James Jackson
10. Utah Jazz
2017-18 record: 44-33
Rookie Donovan Mitchell continues to lead the Jazz as Utah tries to lock up a playoff spot. He has scored at least 20 points in a season-high nine straight games and has 43 games with 20 points this season. That's the most by any rookie since Blake Griffin had 55 games such games during the 2010-11 season. -- Evan Kaplan
11. Indiana Pacers
2017-18 record: 46-31
Victor Oladipo leads the league with 164 steals. He is on pace to be just the second Pacers player to lead the league in that category; Don Buse led the league with 281 steals in 1976-77, one year after leading the ABA with 346 steals in the league's final season. -- Jose De Leon
12. Minnesota Timberwolves
2017-18 record: 44-34
On Wednesday against the Hawks, Karl-Anthony Towns scored a career-high and franchise-record 56 points. The 50-point scorers in Timberwolves history is a rather unique list, as it's made up of Mo Williams, Corey Brewer and Kevin Love (Kevin Garnett's career-high was 47 points). -- Jose De Leon
13. New Orleans Pelicans
2017-18 record: 43-34
Anthony Davis has worked his way into the conversation of top three players in most valuable player voting. His best MVP finish was fifth place in 2014-15, and the best by a New Orleans player was Chris Paul's runner-up finish in 2007-08. -- Jose De Leon
14. Washington Wizards
2017-18 record: 42-35
With John Wall back in the fold, Washington begins its fourth playoff run in five seasons, matching the team's total postseason appearances from 1997-98 to 2012-13. The Wizards need to find their groove soon, though, as they've lost five of their past seven games. Their minus-3.1 net efficiency is 22nd in the NBA over that span, worst among teams over .500. -- James Jackson
15. Milwaukee Bucks
2017-18 record: 41-36
Despite their loss in Denver on Sunday, the Bucks are closing in on consecutive playoff berths for the first time since 2002-03 and 2003-04. Perhaps Jabari Parker can bolster an underwhelming bench (28th in points per game), coming off his first 30-plus-point game since Dec. 28, 2016. -- James Jackson
16. Miami Heat
2017-18 record: 41-36
The Heat have hit their stride offensively, ranking among the NBA's top 10 in both points per game (111.7) and field goal percentage (47.0) during March. In fact, Miami's 111.7 points per game last month marked the team's best output in any full month in franchise history. -- Jason Starrett
17. Denver Nuggets
2017-18 record: 42-35
Since the beginning of February, it is harder to find a better offense than Denver's. The Nuggets lead the NBA with 118.1 points per game over that span and rank second in field goal and 3-point field goal percentages. According to Second Spectrum, the Nuggets have been especially effective on drives, as they are averaging 1.08 points per chance on drives since Feb. 1, third in the NBA over that span. -- Matt Williams
18. LA Clippers
2017-18 record: 41-36
If Lou Williams wins his second Sixth Man Award this season, he will likely finish with the second-most points per game by a winner (22.7). Ricky Pierce in 1989-90 has the highest scoring average by a Sixth Man Award winner (23.0). -- Jose De Leon
19. Detroit Pistons
2017-18 record: 37-40
The Pistons have reversed their fortunes recently, having won seven of their past eight after losing seven of their previous eight. Andre Drummond has been a monster on the glass, averaging 18.7 boards in his past six games. Drummond logged his league-leading seventh 20-20 game of the season on Thursday against the Wizards. -- Sopan Shah
20. Los Angeles Lakers
2017-18 record: 33-43
This past Tuesday, the Lakers were eliminated from postseason contention for the fifth straight season, which is the same amount as their first 65 previous seasons combined. It has been a rough five-season stretch for the Lakers, who have the league's second-worst record since 2013-14. -- Matt Williams
21. Charlotte Hornets
2017-18 record: 34-44
Charlotte will miss the postseason for the third time in five seasons under Steve Clifford. With that said, this season isn't a lost cause, as Kemba Walker recently passed Dell Curry as the team's all-time leading scorer. -- James Jackson
22. Brooklyn Nets
2017-18 record: 25-52
Entering Sunday, the Nets had won two straight, scoring at least 105 points in each of their previous eight games. The Pistons snapped what was the longest active streak in the NBA, and the Nets' longest streak since scoring 105 points in 11 straight games in the 1986-87 season. -- Evan Kaplan
23. New York Knicks
2017-18 record: 27-50
New York has lost at least 50 games in four straight seasons for the first time since the 1960-61 through 1963-64 seasons. Despite losing 50 games again, the Knicks have only a 10.4 percent chance to get a top-five pick in the 2018 NBA draft, according to ESPN's Basketball Power Index. -- Evan Kaplan
24. Chicago Bulls
2017-18 record: 26-51
The Bulls have won consecutive games for the first time since winning three straight in mid-January, and on Sunday against the Wizards matched their franchise record with 18 3-pointers. -- Jose De Leon
25. Dallas Mavericks
2017-18 record: 23-54
This is Rick Carlisle's first 50-loss season as a head coach and first for him overall since he was an assistant to Bill Fitch with the 1990-91 New Jersey Nets (26-56). -- Troy Perlowitz
26. Sacramento Kings
2017-18 record: 25-53
Entering Monday, Sacramento has an 8.4 percent chance to land the top pick in the draft, according to ESPN's Basketball Power Index. The Kings didn't do themselves any favors, as they started a four-game road trip with a one-point win over the Lakers. But with valuable lottery odds at stake, the Kings do close out the season with games against the Spurs and the Rockets. -- Sopan Shah
27. Atlanta Hawks
2017-18 record: 22-55
The Hawks snapped a five-game losing streak on Sunday despite attempting one lone free throw -- they made it -- against the Magic. It was just the second time since 1979-80 that a team won despite only attempting one free throw. The other team was the Grizzlies -- against the Hawks -- on Feb. 8, 2014. -- Jeremy Mills
28. Memphis Grizzlies
2017-18 record: 21-56
The Grizzlies turned heads around the NBA with wins against the Timberwolves and Trail Blazers last week. It marked the first time Memphis won consecutive games against current playoff teams since Oct. 21 and 23 against the Warriors and Rockets. -- Jason Starrett
29. Orlando Magic
2017-18 record: 22-54
According to ESPN's Basketball Power Index, the Magic have a 35.3 percent chance of picking in the top three of this year's draft, the fourth-highest percent chance of doing so. Their last top-three pick was Victor Oladipo, who was taken with the second pick in 2013. -- Jose De Leon
30. Phoenix Suns
2017-18 record: 19-59
The Suns lost to the Rockets on a Gerald Green buzzer-beater on Friday. Over the past 15 seasons, the Suns have lost on a game-winning buzzer-beater 15 times, four more than any other team in the league over that span. -- Jose De Leon

Carmelo Anthony talks about telling Billy Donovan to roll with Jerami Grant down the stretch, but also says he was surprised he wasn't on the floor for the final possession in regulation. (0:59)
His hoodie wrapped tightly over his head and his practice jersey draped over his back like a cape, Carmelo Anthony walked into the Oklahoma City Thunder media room two days after missing three 3-pointers in the final four minutes against the Portland Trail Blazers -- one coming at the buzzer that would have forced overtime.
He was asked a question about being nominated as a finalist for the J. Walter Kennedy award for community service, and another about helping to bus 4,500 Baltimore students to the March For Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C.
Editor's PicksThe reinvention of Carmelo AnthonyCarmelo Anthony has spent his 15-year career doing one thing more than anyone else in the NBA. But as the league moves on without the non-paint 2, Anthony is trying to learn how to move with it.
Carmelo Anthony has spent his 15-year career doing one thing more than anyone else in the NBA. But as the league moves on without the non-paint 2, Anthony is trying to learn how to move with it.
It didn't take long for the conversation to shift back to those misses.
""Oh, we went from the youth to the shots?"" Anthony said with a grin. ""Oh s---. All right. Yeah, I don't worry about that stuff, man, as far as missing or making shots. I've made a lot of shots in my career, and I've missed a lot of shots in my career.
""Those same shots, I'll probably make tomorrow, and we won't even be talking about that.""
""Tomorrow"" was Thursday in San Antonio, where he went 3-of-3 from deep in a 103-99 loss to the Spurs. The following night, against the Denver Nuggets, Anthony was shooting well again, but with two minutes left while waiting to check in at the scorer's table as the Thunder held a six-point lead, he did what many thought Billy Donovan should've done in the game against Portland -- Melo benched himself.
With Jerami Grant playing well and the Thunder winning, Anthony waved at the court and walked back to the sideline. The Nuggets managed to force overtime -- with Anthony watching as Russell Westbrook misfired on a game-winning 3 at the end of regulation -- and the Thunder lost in the extra frame as Anthony played all five minutes, hitting a 3.
It was a strange situation, considering Donovan matter-of-factly stated he was going to play Anthony in those crunch-time spots following the late miscues against Portland: He's a veteran, he's made those shots his whole career. Donovan trusts him.
Donovan walked that back a bit at practice the next day, and then five nights later against Denver, Anthony didn't play a second in the fourth quarter.
Donovan credited Anthony's selflessness for trusting in his teammates, but the volume was already rising on a conversation destined to be sparked as games become more important: What do the Thunder do about Melo?
He knew something had to change, and he knew it needed to be him.
After falling to the New York Knicks on Dec. 16 in his return to Madison Square Garden, Anthony addressed the team, talking roles and acceptance following a 15-point loss to his former team. He wanted to assure them, namely the Thunder's two other stars, that he was OK with this.
From the moment the trade was made, the Thunder envisioned Anthony as a stretch option to complement Westbrook and Paul George, but with egos and pride at play, that determination needed to come organically, and from within.
Following a Dec. 16 loss to the Knicks that sent them under .500 (14-15), the Thunder have turned things around to become a top-10 caliber team.
A few questions into his media day availability, fresh off a physical hours earlier that had him officially joining the Thunder, Anthony was casually asked about how he'd feel about coming off the bench.
""Who, me?"" Anthony said with a chuckle and the perfect amount of sarcasm while George was walking by the room.
""Hey P,"" Anthony said. ""They say I gotta come off the bench!""
Earlier in the season, the three stars implored each other on ""you be you,"" the idea that everybody was cool, the chemistry was great and no one was going to be stepping on toes.
None of it worked. Westbrook was noticeably uncomfortable, George couldn't find a rhythm and Anthony's jab-stepping isos were the record scratches on a star-studded offense.
Before Anthony's change, the Thunder were 25th leaguewide in offensive efficiency. Since then, they're sixth. It's what unlocked the Thunder from their awkward, ""your turn, his turn, my turn"" stalemate.
As tensions eased, the offense flowed, with Westbrook re-establishing himself as the driving force, George playing off him, Steven Adams emerging and Anthony accepting what was left over.
He said in January the game was fun again. In Los Angeles after a game against the Clippers, one reporter asked him about the mythological creature known as Olympic Melo, the catch-and-shoot savant who pulverized international opponents for Team USA -- the player Anthony was going to be for OKC.
""That's my role. You hit it right on the nose,"" he said. ""Make the game easier for myself, make the game easier for Paul, make the game easier for Russ. ...
""I think it was something I had to accept. I've accepted that role on this team. I think that's the role that we need from me in order for us to be successful.""
It took a minute, but Anthony accepted it. He is Olympic Melo. He just hasn't been all that great at it.
It has basically resulted in career lows across the board for Anthony. He expected it, and in some ways is relieved by it. He didn't make the All-Star Game for the first time in seven seasons, but the burden of carrying a team on a nightly basis is gone.
The shots haven't fallen the way he thought they would, with him saying early on he wasn't used to taking them being that open, to now just struggling with taking advantage of the inconsistent number of looks he gets any given night.
Some of the issues have been that his teammates just haven't found him enough. Film sessions for the Thunder regularly include highlighted plays in which Anthony was open from 3 and didn't get the ball.
Internally, coaches and staff have admired the way Anthony has taken on his role and stuck to it. He rarely walks inside the 3-point line, instead spacing the floor to open up rumbling rolls for Adams -- who not coincidentally is having a career season -- and lanes for Westbrook to attack or George to swirl around a screen. Anthony stands on the wing, hands cocked and by his hips, ready to catch and fire.
""I've always respected and admired that regardless of what's happened the night before you can always count on Melo coming back in here as a professional ready to get to work.""
Thunder coach Billy Donovan
Against the Spurs, he hit those three 3s but got only six shots total (zero in the fourth quarter), and the Thunder lost as Westbrook launched some questionable heaves in the final minutes.
Anthony didn't say a word about his lack of shots, either publicly or privately. He's method acting, and he's not breaking character.
It stunned the basketball world that Anthony waived his no-trade clause to leave New York for Oklahoma City, but that was all part of it. Before the ""Who, me?"" on media day, a reporter was setting up a question with the context most thought he'd never accept a trade to Oklahoma City, and Anthony cut him off.
""That's because nobody really knew me, but ..."" Anthony said before the question resumed.
There were a lot of reasons Anthony waived his no-trade clause -- getting away from the toxic situation with the Knicks being part of it -- but the most significant was a desire to reset the narrative on his career. He wants to win, and to be back in the playoffs, somewhere he hasn't been since 2014 after making it every year of his first 11 seasons. He wants to show he can sacrifice for the greater good, to give up a part of himself so a team can succeed.
The Thunder's struggles have been difficult to pinpoint. No one thing has held them back from a true breakthrough. They should be better than their record suggests, but some nights it's free throw shooting, others it's rebounding, and then there was the injury to defensive stalwart Andre Roberson.
Without a primary culprit to diagnose and correct, Anthony has become the easy target because he represents an experiment that hasn't gone as planned. And he seems to keep finding himself in the crosshairs.
He missed two critical free throws against the Boston Celtics that highlighted a six-point collapse in 20 seconds, then followed that up with the aforementioned misses against the Blazers.
Carmelo Anthony says he's upset with himself for missing two free throws at the end of the Thunder's loss that could have iced the game, but tomorrow he'll be prepared to move forward and look to the next game.
What's lost is Westbrook missed one free throw against Boston, and Adams another, while Anthony drilled two 3s and set up one for Corey Brewer that got them the lead in the first place. The shots against Portland were exactly the kind you want Anthony taking -- open, off a catch -- he just didn't make them. And it was brilliance from CJ McCollum that stole that game, not the misses from Anthony, or shoddy defense.
""When you're dealing with a long season with 82 games and the emotions of ups and downs, great wins and tough losses, emotionally and mentally, it can affect your mood, it can affect your disposition,"" Donovan said.
""And I've always respected and admired that regardless what's happened the night before you can always count on Melo coming back in here as a professional ready to get to work and do what he needs to do to help our group. And I've been really impressed with that.""
Anthony was coveted by a number of teams before the Thunder landed him in part because of his ability to go get a bucket when the game breaks down. That's a playoff skill, when possessions grind to a halt and the game is played 24 seconds at a time. But he'll be targeted in the postseason as opposing teams will find ways to attack him defensively, to press the Thunder into switches and try to play Anthony off the floor.
All of the Thunder's best lineups include Anthony, but the fine print often gets lost when it comes to him. Since Roberson's injury, the Thunder have allowed 109.3 points per 100 possessions with Anthony on the court, and 103.9 with him off (in fourth quarters, it's 107.3 on, 102.1 off).
If the shots don't go in to counteract that, he'll be quickly identified as the adjustment OKC should make, fair or not. Coming off the bench was always a bridge too far, even as the Thunder struggled early on, but will Donovan roll with Melo-less lineups to close out games when they count most?
Anthony has given up more than anyone else. He has changed positions, reinvented himself as a stretch-4 and accepted nights of single-digit shot attempts. He has done what has been asked of him.
""Being willing to sacrifice, not every night having to score 20 or 30 points, and I'm good with that, it's a good feeling,"" Anthony said back in December. ""As long as we're winning.""

Bryce Harper takes Sean Newcomb deep to right-center field, his 3rd consecutive at-bat with a home run. (0:25)
We’ve been here before.
Just last April, Bryce Harper hit .391 with nine home runs, 26 RBIs, more walks than strikeouts and a Bondsian 1.281 OPS. He hit nine home runs the next two months combined, then had a big July and was in the MVP running until he went down with a knee injury in August.
In 2016, he had nine home runs and 24 RBIs in April, slugged .714, had more walks than strikeouts and looked like he would repeat as National League MVP. He hit just 15 home runs the rest of the season, however, and although neither Harper nor the Nationals ever confirmed it, he likely played through some sort of shoulder issue.
In 2015, Harper had five home runs in April and 13 in May, remained healthy all season, had a big September with 10 more home runs and captured MVP honors as he led the NL in homers, runs, on-base percentage and slugging.
There’s little doubt that when Harper is healthy and locked in, he’s as good as any hitter in the game. The hard truth, however, is that he has had just one complete season at that level in his career. It was a monster season, to be sure: 10.0 WAR in that MVP campaign. The only other position players to reach 10 WAR in a season this century are Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Alex Rodriguez and Mike Trout. Nonetheless, from his rookie season in 2012 through 2017, Harper ranks just 18th in WAR among position players, wedged between Kyle Seager and Freddie Freeman, two players with decidedly fewer magazine covers than Harper.
In Monday’s 8-1 win for the Nationals over the Braves, Harper blasted his third home run in two games, a 425-foot shot off lefty Sean Newcomb. He also walked four times, and even though there were two outs in the ninth when he came up for a sixth plate appearance, the Braves brought in a lefty to face him (Harper grounded out). That’s some serious respect.
In his first four games, Harper is hitting .417/.550/1.167 with six walks and no strikeouts. Yes, he has faced the Reds and then an inexperienced Atlanta starter, but that early walk ratio is perhaps a sign of big things to come for 2018. In his MVP season, Harper had 109 unintentional walks and 131 strikeouts; in 2016, it was 88 and 117; last year, that ratio dropped to 57 and 99. His chase rate increased from 25 and 24 percent the previous two seasons to 30.6 percent, which led to a higher swinging-strike rate. He still hit .319/.413/.595.
So imagine Harper at the top of his game for six months, with a little better plate discipline and no nagging injuries. He already is this season’s focal player in many ways, trying to lead the Nationals out of the first round of the playoffs and to a World Series title with his impending free agency looming in the background. He’s off to a $400 million start.
Astros celebrate championship: The Astros had a nice pregame ceremony that included the raising of the World Series banner ... only to hit a minor snafu when the draping got caught and a worker had to use a leaf blower to get it untangled, drawing a few chuckles from Astros players.
The best part came when Rich Dauer, last year’s first-base coach, threw out the first pitch. Dauer nearly died after feeling ill during the World Series parade (he had fallen at home, which caused bleeding in his brain). He had surgery for an acute subdural hematoma, spent three days in a coma and doctors said he had a 3 percent chance of survival.
It was an emotional return to the field today for Rich Dauer.We couldn't be happier to have you here, Coach! pic.twitter.com/AeD7Q5rwjg

From there, Charlie Morton picked up where he left off in Game 7 of the World Series, tossing six scoreless innings in a 6-1 victory over the Orioles. Morton induced 17 swing-and-misses, matching his career high, and averaged 96.7 mph with his fastball. Reminder: He’s the team’s No. 5 starter. Reminder: The Astros are good. Morton didn’t even think he had his ""A"" stuff, however. (He was a little all over the place with his fastball, although it worked in an effectively wild kind of way.)

One minor concern: Carlos Correa, who fouled a ball off his foot on Sunday, left after one at-bat Monday. He told ESPN’s Marly Rivera he felt some pain, and while there’s structural damage, he’s day-to-day for now.
Attendance woes: There were several “Yikes” tweets about the A’s announced attendance of 7,416. A’s beat writer Susan Slusser reported it was the team’s lowest attendance since April 3, 2003, when the team drew 6,295 fans. That game, however, was a makeup game after a planned trip to Japan had been canceled.
Maybe even more surprising was Toronto’s attendance of 16,629. The Blue Jays had just six crowds below 30,000 last season, with a low of 28,401 for a September game against the Orioles. The Jays’ attendance had soared past 3 million each of the past two seasons, the first time they had reached that mark since drawing 4 million in 1993. Is the bandwagon falling apart after one sub-.500 season?
Yes, it was a Monday night in early April, not exactly prime time for big attendance figures. The extra off days this season help with travel, but making a season that’s already too long for many fans a week longer doesn’t help.
The Blue Jays game, a 4-2 win over the White Sox, did offer an interesting moment when Josh Donaldson homered and then pretended to blow a whistle toward the White Sox dugout. Apparently, White Sox coach Daryl Boston whistles whenever the Sox make a good defensive play -- which seems as ridiculous as it must sound -- and Donaldson was miffed about a whistle earlier in the game when he grounded out. While the Sox dugout laughed at the gesture, this is Josh Donaldson we’re talking about: He didn’t do it to draw a laugh.
Bartolo Colon is still alive and kicking: The A’s drew fewer than 8,000 fans even though Colon started for the Rangers, giving him 21 seasons in the majors. The Rangers became the 11th team he has started for, one fewer than Mike Morgan’s record of 12, and teams seem determined to give him a chance to break Morgan’s mark. I don’t know what’s more remarkable: That Colon was given another opportunity to start after posting a 6.48 ERA last year for the Braves and Twins, or that he allowed just one run in six innings and looked pretty good on Monday. He had just five starts of that quality last year out of 28 outings, although two of those did come in April.
Colon still throws almost all fastballs and sinkers -- 72 of his 89 pitches Monday -- and throws strikes, but he turns 45 in May and starting him feels more like a move of desperation for a potential playoff contender than one that is likely to pay dividends.

Dez Bryant's and Jesse James' overturned catches are just two of the plays that would have different outcomes with the NFL's catch rule revision. (0:49)
ORLANDO, Fla. -- This is a story about traditionalists fighting back against technology. And winning!
For much of this decade, the NFL has pushed for video access on sidelines during games. It seemed logical. Coaches and players spend hours every week studying video. They still call it ""film"" or ""tape,"" of course. By any name, it is an essential part of reviewing the previous game and preparing for the next. Why not have it available in real time, to help with in-game adjustments or on-the-fly matchup evaluations?
Editor's PicksGuide to NFL's new rules: What to know about approved, tabled and rejected proposalsThe revised catch rule wasn't even the biggest news out of Orlando. Here's what the ban on lowering heads to initiate contact and other changes mean.NFL execs unfiltered: Winners and losers for all 32 teams in free agencyWith the initial flurry of free agency in the rearview mirror, we asked coaches, execs and insiders around the league to offer their unvarnished opinions on how other teams did -- for better or worse.1 Related
The revised catch rule wasn't even the biggest news out of Orlando. Here's what the ban on lowering heads to initiate contact and other changes mean.
With the initial flurry of free agency in the rearview mirror, we asked coaches, execs and insiders around the league to offer their unvarnished opinions on how other teams did -- for better or worse.
So at last week's owners meetings, for the second time in three years, the NFL competition committee proposed a bylaw change to add video functionality to select Microsoft Surface Pro tablets already used to view still images on sidelines.
Coaches? They lost their dadgum minds.
They reacted so forcefully, in fact, that committee chairman Rich McKay tabled the proposal and said it likely wouldn't be addressed before the 2018 season. Investigating this fracas at the annual meetings proved to be an amusing journey into the deep but occasionally absurdist minds of the top 32 football coaches in the world.
In essence, NFL coaches think video would make in-game adjustments too easy for the ill-prepared slappies among them. (Themselves excluded, of course.)
""If I'm looking at the video, I'll never be wrong,"" Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. ""I'm against it because I think it takes some of your true coaching skills away and it makes it even for everybody, for good coaches and bad coaches.""
This viewpoint is less a manifesto on the intrusion of technology -- although most coaches hate that, too -- and more about protecting what seems to be the tiniest slice of a winning edge.
Coaches have spent years honing their ability to recognize crucial in-game insight, be it a formation on the other side of the field or a ""tell"" given away on the still photographs they now view on tablets. At times, they base their game plans on the introduction of a strategy that appears confusing to the naked eye but would reveal itself easily -- but too late -- in next-day film sessions.
Adding video, coaches said, would risk the leveling out of that advantage. It's part of the same mentality that compels them to obfuscate their injury reports, to close practice for all but warm-up drills and to refuse to identify their starting nose tackle. Winning is not a single-thrust event to them. It is the sum of everything that happens during the week, major or nearly irrelevant, real or perceived.
""We come in on Monday morning and start watching the tape,"" Zimmer said, ""And you say, 'Oh that's what they were doing.' Now, you wouldn't. So I can do this at six minutes in the first quarter and say, 'Oh here this is what they're doing. Here's how they blocked this.' And I can coach my guys on what's happening. Whereas in the past, you have to rely on your skills to figure it out.
""It takes coaching and all of the things out of this when you go and sit there and watch it. Anyone can do that. I can bring [anyone] in there [to watch video] and say, 'The left guard is pulling, and they're blocking down in a combination down on the linebacker.' Anyone can figure that out [with video]. But that's what we're supposed to do as coaches.""
Quite reasonably, the competition committee's McKay said that ""really good coaches will find a way to use [video] to their advantage."" But the coaches weren't having it.
The Green Bay Packers' Mike McCarthy views in-game adjustments as a matter of concise communication. Can a coach, in a manner of seconds or a minute, talk through a development with a player to fix a problem or change a strategy? Video would show them an indisputable answer, but could perhaps eliminate the essential verbal communication. (Parents of kids with any type of electronic device would understand.)
McCarthy said he understood the natural evolution of technology for football operations, but rued the possible loss of competitive edge.
""If this makes coaches and players not use their ability to communicate off of pictures,"" he said, ""I'm not for it.""
McCarthy was speaking a few hours before the issue was introduced for discussion last Tuesday morning. Unprompted, and to his dismay, McCarthy said he thought it would pass. The competition committee had attempted a compromise by limiting the number of video-enabled tablets to five on the sideline and two in the coaches' booth, and there was an unspoken understanding that the NFL's $400 million sponsorship with Microsoft was in play as well. Under the proposal, All-22 video would be loaded instantaneously into a dedicated app and ""tracked"" so that users could find an individual play without having to manually toggle.
But as it turns out, opposition was widespread. Owners have the authority to decide any vote, regardless of internal opposition, but chose not to die on this hill. In fact, even the youngest and presumably hippest coach in the NFL was in no rush to transition to video.
The Los Angeles Rams' Sean McVay made clear he is happy to stand on the sideline, in the year 2018, viewing still photographs on a tablet. McVay is 32 years old, placing him squarely in the smartphone generation. But when you learn at the side of old-school coaches, as McVay did, you tend to endorse their rhythms as well.
""[Video] allows you to see the entirety of some of the things that maybe you didn't see,"" he said, ""but I think what you respect about this league is that we see it in live action, make adjustments and are able to adapt as you go. ... I think we're all a product of the experiences and the environments we have. So all you really know is the pictures and kind of being able to take that snapshot.
""I think just personally, the way that we've operated, I would love to be able to continue to do that.""
Not every coach was sweating it, of course. The Seattle Seahawks' Pete Carroll, who is 66 years old and has been a witness to massive change in the game over his career, seemed to have been preparing for it.
""We have had experience with using video in practice,"" he said, ""so guys are already starting to adapt. Some coaches use it more than others and some players take to it more than others. ... It's just more information, which sounds classic for our time, but I think it will work out fine.""
Indeed, it's easy to imagine a day when no one has the energy to fight a proposal that isn't going away. Perhaps it won't arrive until after this generation of coaching traditionalists have moved on. Sideline video is hardly the most pressing issue in the NFL. But every now and then, we get a clear glimpse into how its most powerful people think. This one was revealing.

FRISCO, Texas -- At last week’s coaches breakfast from the NFL owners meetings, Jason Garrett’s table was filled with four local reporters for most of the hour. A few camera operators came and went. A smattering of reporters came by asking a couple of quick questions before moving on.
About 10 feet away, Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson spoke. For most of the 60 minutes, he had a two-deep crowd of reporters and camera operators wondering what life has been like since winning Super Bowl LII.
For the Dallas Cowboys to become relevant in 2018, they need to close the gap on the Eagles. On Monday, NFL Nation reporters were asked if anything that has happened so far in the offseason has closed the gap.
Last week, Garrett was asked about the gap.
“Winning your division is important. Being competitive with the teams in your division is important. You got to win those games,” Garrett said. “If you want to win the NFC, you've got to start by doing everything you can to win the NFC East. Then you have to take the next step beyond that. So, it’s a process that you go through. For me, teams get in trouble when they are so focused on somebody else. Focus on yourself and the kind of team you want to build. ...
“We want to build the kind of team we want to build. We want them thinking about us. And obviously they did a great job this year. They won a lot of games. They won the critical games in the playoffs and the Super Bowl. Hats off to them. They did a fantastic job. But we are focused on the Cowboys and the team we think we need to build.”
Before winning the Super Bowl, the Eagles finished 13-3, running away with the NFC East. The Cowboys finished second with a 9-7 record. They lost, 37-9, at AT&T Stadium to Philadelphia but won the season finale at Lincoln Financial Field, 6-0, with the Eagles resting a number of starters for parts, most or all of the game. The win allowed the Cowboys to finish with a winning record in back-to-back seasons for the first time under Garrett but ultimately cost them a couple of spots in the first round of the draft.
To help close the gap so far in the offseason, the Cowboys have added two offensive linemen (Cameron Fleming, Marcus Martin), two wide receivers (Allen Hurns, Deonte Thompson) and a linebacker (Joe Thomas). They placed the franchise tag on Pro Bowl defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence. They put the second-round tender on defensive lineman David Irving.

The Eagles traded for defensive end Michael Bennett from the Seattle Seahawks. They signed defensive tackle Haloti Ngata and wide receiver Mike Wallace in free agency. They were able to keep a key defender in linebacker Nigel Bradham. They will also have Carson Wentz returning from his knee injury.
In 2015 and ’16, the Eagles finished 7-9, moving on from Chip Kelly and giving the power back to Howie Roseman, who made a number of shrewd personnel moves to position Philadelphia as a Super Bowl contender, including hiring Pederson.
Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones was asked how Philadelphia figured out how to become a Super Bowl team in two years as Dallas looked for its first championship since 1995.
“Well, Philadelphia had been trying to win a Super Bowl the 30 years I’d been in the NFL and got it this year. Not two [years],” Jones said. “So, they’ve been trying a long time to win a Super Bowl and other teams have, too. So, it wasn’t just a two-year run for them to go to the Super Bowl.”
In order to close the gap, there must be a definition of the gap. Jones sees more similarities between the Eagles and Cowboys.
“They’ve got a team that mirrors us in a lot of respects,” Jones said. “I like a lot of things that we have that they have. We’ve got a running game, offense and quarterback [Dak Prescott] that I’m so proud of for looking ahead and building off of. They probably have more, to say the least, they probably have more names on defense. When I say names, just say they probably have what we’d like to continue to get to. But we’ve got some guys that I think we can get to there.
“I’d like to think that Philly closed the deal of where we had an opportunity to do it the year before.”
The Cowboys finished 13-3 in 2016 and the Eagles finished second in the division and out of the playoffs. The Cowboys, however, were not able to capitalize on home-field advantage in the postseason, losing to the Green Bay Packers.
“I think that if the gap is defined as them winning the Super Bowl and [us] not even getting in the playoffs, then we've got to close the gap,” Jones said. “I think that we should've been in the playoffs. We weren't. But I don't believe that us not being in the playoffs this past year is the size of the gap.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans safety Kevin Byard is one of the lucky group of confidants who got a sneak glimpse of the team's new uniforms, but he isn't letting the cat out of the bag. One note he did reveal is that he likes the uniforms and he believes the fans will, too.
The new uniforms have been the talk of the Titans' fan base for much of the offseason. Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk has said the uniforms will have significant changes, but it won't be a total reconstruction. The uniforms will be unveiled during a downtown Nashville street party on Wednesday night.
""I think everybody is hyped. I've seen the jerseys, so I know what they look like. I think all the fans are going to be super excited,"" Byard said. ""April 4th, you should come out and see them. It's going to be a big event. I know for our owner, that's been like her baby.""
Byard, like others who have been privy to the new-look jerseys early, had to sign a nondisclosure agreement which instructed him to keep details close to the vest. He has obliged, only giving his general impression of the jersey even though he's been asked by multiple teammates. He's told them they'll like it when they put it on and see it in person.
""Of course I like them,"" Byard said. ""I'm not going to give any hints or anything like that, but they'll be great uniforms and I think we're going to be the talk of the league in a couple days.""

The Titans' new uniforms, which they've branded as ""tradition evolved,"" come on the 20th season of the franchise in its current name state. People have posted different ideas about leaks over the coming days, but there is still a large mystery around the reveal and it is expected to draw a large crowd.
Pre-party festivities begin at 4 p.m. CT and the entire event is scheduled to run until a little after 9 p.m. Florida Georgia Line will perform after the unveiling, which is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m.
We took a trip to @usnikefootball to learn more about our new uniforms. #TitanUp pic.twitter.com/72a3tmKi5n

Titans cornerback Logan Ryan is among those curious about how the uniforms will turn out.
""I haven't seen them -- I'm not All-Pro yet, so I haven't had the luxury of what KB saw,"" Ryan joked. ""I've heard good things. I think it's cool. The direction we're in, I think we've been really close with this Predators wave in Nashville and see how excited the city is getting. We're on our way up.""

The first wave of free agency is behind us. High-profile players now have new homes, but questions still remain. NFL Nation provides the answers. Today, we look at the AFC.
The Browns will be trying to mesh a new offensive system with a new coordinator, new quarterback, new running back and new receivers in 2018. That requires hard work and time, but the process also puts the Browns in position to be much more competitive this season. Could the Browns actually compete for a playoff spot after going 0-16 in 2017? AFC North roundtable
The 2017 Jaguars set the standard for secondary play in the AFC South. This offseason, most of the division attempted to follow suit, making splashy secondary moves. The Tennessee Titans signed former Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler to a five-year, $61.25 million deal, and the Houston Texans signed former Cardinals safety Tyrann Mathieu to a one-year, $7 million deal. AFC South roundtable
The Patriots have won the AFC East championship in each of the past nine seasons, which is the longest streak of division titles in NFL history. In 2018, which team has done the most to close the gap with the Patriots through free agency and trade acquisitions? AFC East roundtable
John Elway has vowed to ""do what we have to do"" to get back in the playoff conversation, and after weeks of evaluation, Elway said Keenum was ""the target ... the best fit for us."" Keenum is just the guy to get the Broncos back on track, per Elway. Our four AFC West beat reporters take a look at what impact Keenum could have on the division race. AFC West roundtable
Sure, the Minnesota Vikings won the NFC North last season, but Aaron Rodgers played only seven games because of a broken collarbone. When healthy, Rodgers is the best quarterback in the league. Will Cousins be enough to keep the Vikings atop the NFC North in 2018? NFC North roundtable
The Saints re-signing Drew Brees has to be the biggest move made in the NFC South -- hard to argue with bringing back a future Hall of Fame quarterback. After that there is plenty of room to debate which of the many under-the-radar signings could have the biggest impact on the division. NFC South roundtable
The Eagles only have to look at recent NFC East history to know that success is no guarantee from one year to the next, as there hasn’t been a repeat division champ in the NFC East since the Eagles won four in a row from 2001 to '04. They know the Cowboys, Giants and Redskins are coming for the crown. NFC East roundtable
With Suh on board, the Rams now feature one of the most ferocious defensive tackle combinations in recent memory as he joins reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald and the oft-underrated Michael Brockers on the Rams’ front line. Last offseason, the Rams performed a dramatic makeover on their offense, which surged from the bottom of the league to the top in total points. Now, they’re hoping for a big leap from coordinator Wade Phillips’ defense. NFC West roundtable

Juventus and Real Madrid clash in a rematch of last year's UCL final, relive the two clubs history in the knockout round. (1:37)
Sometimes, less is more. Sometimes, having options confuses and leads you down blind alleys. Sometimes, when you have no other choices, you focus on execution over scheme: doing what you can do as well as you possibly can do it, rather than worrying about whether there's a better way.
That's not where Zinedine Zidane and Max Allegri will find themselves Tuesday when Real Madrid travel to Juventus in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. It will be about choices and decisions, both in terms of tactics and personnel.
In our desire to pigeonhole, each man has a reputation as ""man-managers"" rather than tacticians (as if one precludes the other). Allegri bristles at this, Zidane shrugs and pulls the old stone-face. Either way, Tuesday night won't be about motivating, it will be about getting the right mix on the pitch.
Start with Real Madrid. Where it once was simple and straightforward -- 4-3-3 and BBC -- you now have a rainbow of permutations, the only two cast-iron certainties in the front six being Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric.
Indeed, the scheme itself is a question mark. A 4-4-2, like the one employed at the Parc des Princes against PSG or away to Las Palmas at the weekend has plenty going for it. It enables you to play Ronaldo centrally, with two wide men ready to supply him and, depending who you play, you can provide plenty of cover for the fullbacks, something you don't always get down Ronaldo's flank when he's wide.
Then again, the 4-3-3 means you don't have to sacrifice one of your central midfielders. Modric and Toni Kroos can double up in wide areas when they need to, and Casemiro ensures an added layer of protection to the central defenders. It's far easier to maintain possession with three in the middle of the park in a formation that Zidane used to win two past Champions Leagues.
It certainly ain't broke, so why fix it?
Then you get into personnel. Whichever way you slice it, Karim Benzema really has to be there. It's easy to see why: playing Ronaldo through the middle on his own gives the opposing central defenders a free pass to take the ball into midfield whenever they like and the only other viable alternative is some kind of fancy Marco Asensio ""false nine"" mumbo-jumbo. Benzema has evolved into a different player since Zidane took over: He's not an attacking terminus, he drops off, creates space and works across the offensive front. His goals have declined (40 in 101 post-Zidane, 62 in 116 pre-Zidane) but more than ever, he brings different qualities.
So if Benzema, Ronaldo and Modric (the latter two for obvious reasons) are untouchable, who gets the other three slots?
Every action has an opposite and equivalent reaction. Breaking up the midfield trio when you don't have to feels like thinking a little too far outside the box. Casemiro doesn't just give Modric licence to do what he does best -- transitions -- it also limits the number of times Sergio Ramos has to defend in open space. Kroos already has three Champions League titles at home, and he offers a rare combination of size and quality.
On the other hand, if you stick with three, you only have one slot up for grabs and three prime candidates to fill it. Gareth Bale looks fit again. Isco was phenomenal down the stretch last season and is arguably the most creative player in La Liga: if Juve park the bus, he's the guy you want unlocking their defence. Then there's Asensio, the wild card, the kid whose energy and talent can turn games at any moment.
Across the way, Allegri is more used to mixing things up. He began the season with a 4-2-3-1, reverted to a 4-3-3 with tremendous success and occasionally employed a 3-5-2 for big matches (like Saturday's victory over Milan). His hand is somewhat forced here in that no fewer than three regulars are unavailable: Medhi Benatia and Miralem Pjanic are suspended, while Sami Khedira is injured.
What to do?
He can wheel out a 3-5-2 again -- even without Benatia -- by lining up Andrea Barzagli and Daniele Rugani alongside Giorgio Chiellini. That's the uber-defensive option predicated on denying the away goal. Particularly since, with Pjanic most likely replaced by Rodrigo Bentancur, it promises to be more of a muscular midfield.
Four at the back seems more sensible (although it's quite a personnel decision between the legs of Rugani and the savvy of Barzagli). But then what? Going 4-3-3 means putting Paulo Dybala wide, but then you're left with a choice between the size and mismatches that Mario Mandzukic (who is recovering from injury) can provide on the opposite flank or the flat-out pace of Douglas Costa. Not to mention the trickery of Jose Cuadrado, who happened to score the winner at the weekend.
Indeed, if you're concerned about the loss of Pjanic's quality in midfield, you could revert to a 4-2-3-1, put Dybala deeper in the hole and add a winger. That might help pin back Marcelo and Dani Carvajal. Allegri has a knack for throwing unexpected curveballs in big games, but when you don't know what the opposition is going to do, it becomes that much harder to react.
At the top of the Champions League, most managers pride themselves on doing their own thing, rather than reacting to opponents or tailoring their side to get an edge against a certain opponent. Think Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola or Bayern, where the personnel can change, but the scheme does not. The old trope whereby managers say ""we're not going to worry about them, they'll have to worry about us"" isn't just manager speak: they're really not interested in tactical ju-jitsu.
Not here. Not in this matchup. This promises to be an old school tactical chess match where the range of options, far from being reassuring, is bound to lead to a raft of second-guessing.

Daniel Bryan says he isn't sure when his first match back will be, but the WWE Universe clearly has a positive reaction. (1:21)
As a service to fans who have a general interest in the WWE but might not have watched a match since the last WrestleMania, we're happy to provide this FAQ as a guide to WrestleMania 34.
Q. Hey, it's WrestleMania time again, isn't it? 
Please refer to it casually as ""The Showcase of the Immortals,"" per Vince McMahon's marketing department.
Q. Didn't they just have a WrestleMania in New Orleans? 
WrestleMania XXX was held in 2014. That event featured John Cena in a midcard match, Triple H inexplicably still wrestling and Daniel Bryan as the most popular worker on the card. This WrestleMania is much different, as it features John Cena in a midcard match, Triple H inexplicably still wrestling, Daniel Bryan as the most popular worker on the card -- but also Ronda Rousey.
Q. What has Ronda Rousey been doing since she arrived in WWE? 
Pointing at a sign, being fairly mediocre on the mic, but also wearing the heck out of ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper's old leather jacket and putting Triple H through a table during a contract signing, which was admittedly awesome. She's teaming up against Triple H and Stephanie McMahon with Kurt Angle, who tattletaled that wrestling's first couple had talked about ""owning"" Rousey and embarrassing her after she embarrassed them at a WrestleMania 31 confrontation. That this is one of two matches set up by people saying mean things behind one's back is rather depressing. More on that later.
Q. Wait, wasn't The Rock involved in that WrestleMania 31 angle? Why isn't he her partner? 
Did we mention ""Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle"" grossed over $943 million worldwide without the necessity of any appearances on WWE programming? That said, he's got a new movie coming out based on a video game in which a mutated gorilla smashes a city and eats people, so expect him at WrestleMania in some capacity, perhaps a sing-off with (Who Wants To Walk With?) Elias.
Q. I just realized you said Daniel Bryan is wrestling, which can't be right because the doctors said he'd never wrestle again. He's been cleared? 
Yes! Yes! Yes! Bryan was cleared by doctors to return to action, which is fantastic. He's involved in a somewhat complicated angle that's grown out of Kevin Owens' feud with Shane McMahon on SmackDown. They had a brutal cage match at WWE Hell in a Cell, where McMahon leapt off the top of the cage and missed Owens when Sami Zayn, his enemy turned friend again, pulled Owens to safety. Bryan sided with the two during their contentious battle with McMahon, the SmackDown commissioner. At one point, McMahon booked a match between Owens and Zayn at WrestleMania, and they responded by beating him up. So Bryan fired them, then they beat him up too, and now we have Owens and Zayn vs. Bryan and McMahon, provided McMahon is healed up from his sudden bout of acute diverticulitis and an umbilical hernia, both of which sound like something that would prevent a 48-year-old millionaire from jumping off something really high for the edification of spot-thirsty fans, but what do we know?
Editor's PicksRonda Rousey focusing on present, moving on from pastRonda Rousey was the UFC's first women's champion and MMA's most dominant fighter. But that was in the past, and she's not interested in that anymore. Rousey is in the WWE now, doing what is making her happy.Setting the tone: Opening matches at WrestleMania that changed the gameCompeting in the main event of WrestleMania represents the pinnacle of any performer's career, but over three decades, many of those put in position to open up WWE's biggest pay-per-view event of the year have made that a special spot in its own right.Triple H reacts to Daniel Bryan's return to the ring and his long road to getting clearedDespite their on-screen animosities of the past, Triple H is happy for Daniel Bryan's return and happier for Bryan Danielson, the man. He reflects on the long road to Bryan getting cleared, previous fears of Bryan leaving and their WrestleMania XXX match.2 Related
Ronda Rousey was the UFC's first women's champion and MMA's most dominant fighter. But that was in the past, and she's not interested in that anymore. Rousey is in the WWE now, doing what is making her happy.
Competing in the main event of WrestleMania represents the pinnacle of any performer's career, but over three decades, many of those put in position to open up WWE's biggest pay-per-view event of the year have made that a special spot in its own right.
Despite their on-screen animosities of the past, Triple H is happy for Daniel Bryan's return and happier for Bryan Danielson, the man. He reflects on the long road to Bryan getting cleared, previous fears of Bryan leaving and their WrestleMania XXX match.
Q. Will the Undertaker be there? 
He's not officially announced, but John Cena has been attempting to goad him into a match by calling him a coward, borrowing his wrestling moves and running old photos of his previous gimmicks on his Instagram, which is harsh. But it's not like the WWE to reference the Undertaker and then disappoint everyone when he doesn't make an appearance, unless you count the three dozen or so other times they've done that, most recently with Dolph Ziggler on Smackdown.
Q. Oh, mysteries are fun! Any other undetermined matches? 
Totally. Braun Strowman, the ""Monster Among Men"" whom you may remember from such hits as Guy Flips Over An Ambulance and Guy Flips Over A Semi-Truck and Guy Flips Over Raw Commentary Set won a Raw Tag Team Battle Royal which put him in a match against champions Cesaro & Sheamus. Except he doesn't have a partner. So speculation is that it could be someone large (The Big Show!) or small (pretty much every other option!) or that Strowman could attempt to win the tag-team titles as an individual. Get these hands!
Q. What about the Smackdown tag belts? 
The Uso brothers have them, and face the human embodiment of joy The New Day and The Bludgeon Brothers, who are former Wyatt Family members Harper and Rowan. The Usos and The New Day topped our 2017 tag-team rankings thanks to an outstanding series of matches against each other. Also, the Bludgeon Brothers are in this match.
Q. A three-way for the tag belts. Are there other multiwrestler gimmick matches on the card? 
Don't you know it. The Miz, who is trying to have ""the longest cumulative run as Intercontinental Champion of all time"" according to WWE, puts the belt on the line against Seth Rollins and Finn Balor, who best show up painted like a dang demon, or we riot. While we respect the work of his opponents, The Miz is a national treasure who just became a father and we want only good things for this glorious heel.
But hey, what if three isn't enough: How about four? The United States championship is on the line as Randy Orton defends against former Demographic Chasing champion Jinder Mahal, Bobby Roode's entrance theme and Rusev, who is the kind of fan-driven sensation that the WWE usually doesn't reward until a year after his heat is gone. Oh, and today is Rusev Day. Happy Rusev Day everyone.
Q. OK, but what if four isn't enough? Please tell me there's a battle royal on the card. 
There isn't a battle royal -- there are BATTLE ROYALS! Or battles royal! We're honestly not sure of the plurality. The Andre The Giant Memorial battle royal will be held for the fifth year. Please recall that Mojo Rawley won the event last year with the help of New England Patriot and obvious future wrestler Rob Gronkowski. He's back in the event with eight others, including ""Woken"" Matt Hardy. (We realize this FAQ is meant to catch up everyone on the card and how we got here, but we'll just assume you have at least a tangential knowledge of what's happened with Matt Hardy in the past few years, lest we spend the next 1,000 words explaining sentient drones, Senõr Benjamin and The Lake of Reincarnation.)
Meanwhile, there's the first-ever Women's Battle Royal, which used to be known as the Fabulous Moolah Battle Royal until fans revolted against the WWE honoring a problematic former champion. So it's just the Women's Battle Royal, because doing the right thing and naming it after Chyna would have been too easy. Anyway, it gives Sasha Banks something to do at WrestleMania.
Q. What are the other women's matches? 
Alexa Bliss (she might be 5 feet tall) defends the Raw Women's Champion against Nia Jax (billed at 6 feet and over 240 pounds). While the WWE's women's division is arguably the best it's ever been, the storytelling can still offer up ""Mean Girls"" nonsense like ""Alexa Bliss says mean things about her friend Nia Jax behind her back and it gets caught on camera,"" which is how we ended up here.
The good news is that the other women's match could be the show-stealer: Asuka, who won the first Women's Royal Rumble, chose Charlotte Flair as her opponent. So you have an undefeated challenger against a long-tenured champion and icon of the women's division. Even if you sort of know where this might be headed, getting there is the fun. Heck, Asuka's entrance might be the WrestleMania Moment™ of the night.
Q. OK, now we're getting into the prime cuts of WrestleMania. How good is AJ Styles versus Shinsuke Nakamura going to be? 
It won't be Wrestle Kingdom 10 good, but it will be amazing and worthy of the two-year build back to this rematch, which should start a series of bouts between the two. Nakamura, who won the Royal Rumble to set up this match, has been captivating as an entertainer but hasn't reached the heights as a wrestler that he did in Japan. So a reunion with WWE champion and arguably the organization's best worker AJ Styles will, hopefully, bring back the total package. For, like, Nakamura. We're not expecting a Lex Luger run-in.
Q. Finally, how sad will I be when Roman Reigns wins the Universal Title from Brock Lesnar?
Look, you shouldn't be. Assuming Reigns wins -- and what awful booking would it be to build up Brock as an egotistical part-time champion who takes the fans for granted and then have him leave Mania with the belt? --  the Roman lovers and Roman haters should get something out of this match.
The former will likely see a beatdown reminiscent of the one Lesnar gave Reigns in their no-decision a few years ago. Which means he could be a bloody pulp by the time he makes the latter squeal with a title win. Reigns actually had one of this best moments in the WWE during the buildup to this match, cutting a promo on how Lesnar is a corporately supported champion who often seems like he's above all this 'rasslin stuff. No doubt he practiced it in front of a mirror.
Q. Wait, I think we skipped the cruiserweight champ... 
No one cares about the cruiserweight division. Enjoy the show! (OK, don't @ me. If you do care, go here.)

NEW YORK -- There's a human aspect of NHL player transactions that gets underreported or summarily ignored.

The Rangers fell short of the playoffs in 2017-18 as they commit to a refresh of the roster while Henrik Lundqvist is still at the top of his game. Here are the areas that GM Jeff Gorton & Co. should focus on this summer.

Only one NHL team gets to raise the Stanley Cup in June. But all of them will be working hard this summer to try to get there at the end of next season. Here are the keys to the offseason for every team, published as they are eliminated.
The stuff about uprooting families, selling houses and transitioning one's life from city to city. The stuff about how a comfortable daily hang with your closest friends suddenly turns into awkward glances at a roomful of strangers, like the new kid in class. The stuff about how seeing a friend pack up his gear for the last time can be difficult, especially when the new team is tangibly closer to winning a Stanley Cup than the one he's leaving.
That's why New York Rangers forward Mats Zuccarello is pretty bummed about Ryan McDonagh being traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning. He didn't just lose a captain. He didn't just lose a teammate. He lost a friend. One whose wife prepared him his first American Thanksgiving meal.
""We got a little drunk. I'm not going to lie,"" Zuccarello said recently, before a Rangers game against the Lightning. ""I hadn't scored in the AHL before. Then after that night, I scored three goals my next game.""
But when Zuccarello looks over at the Lightning, it's not just McDonagh he sees. It's five members of the Rangers' Stanley Cup finalist from 2013-14 that, almost unbelievably, have ended up together on Tampa Bay this season: Defensemen McDonagh, Dan Girardi and Anton Stralman, along with forwards Ryan Callahan and J.T. Miller.
""It for sure sucks to see that all of them have a chance to win the Stanley Cup,"" said Zuccarello, whose team has been eliminated from playoff contention.
While all of them acknowledge it was tough to leave the Rangers, none of them are complaining about the upgrade in postseason positioning.
""It's a good team, so it's pretty cool for us,"" said Miller. ""And Mac and I knew some of the guys down here, obviously.""
After a recent win against the New York Islanders, Stralman was seated among a row of lockers that wouldn't have looked out of place in Madison Square Garden -- near both McDonagh and Girardi, and within spitting distance of Miller.
""It's all good guys, quality players and quality persons. And we obviously had a very good team when we made the finals,"" said Stralman. ""When you have a journey like we had there, you keep some very strong bonds.""

Which teams have the best shot at locking up a playoff spot? Who's earning a better shot at the No. 1 overall pick? Here are the latest projections for both, along with critical matchups to watch today and more. Read »
The ex-Rangers are like a core within a core: a group of players that bonded together on another team that end up on the same roster somewhere else. This is commonplace for, say, minor league players -- please recall ""Coop's Troops,"" former Syracuse Crunch players who followed coach Jon Cooper up to the Lightning and formed the basis of the Triplets Line (Tyler Johnson, Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov).
But it's much rarer to have five players who skated for another NHL team end up on another roster.
""I think it's a coincidence more than anything. But for me, having those familiar faces around has been such a huge help with the transition,"" said McDonagh.
Callahan was the first Rangers player who ended up in Tampa, sent there in March 2014 in the trade that brought Martin St. Louis to the Rangers. Stralman signed a five-year, $22.5 million free-agent deal with the Lightning in July 2014. Dan Girardi signed a two-year deal worth $6 million last summer, after the Rangers bought out the rest of his contract. McDonagh and Miller were traded to the Lightning at the deadline this season.
(Brian Boyle, currently with the New Jersey Devils, was another member of that 2013-14 New York team that spent time with the Lightning.)
""There's a running joke going on in the room that we're the Rangers of the South,"" said Cooper.
""You gotta think that Girardi, McDonagh and Stralman are going to have chemistry, having played with each other for years,"" he added. ""But the biggest thing was that they're competitors. We need guys that can play hard, can play against big players and have played in big spots before. They check all the boxes.""
In the case of Miller, Cooper's hoping that he's found a young talent who can hang in the top six with his elite players. He coached Miller at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, and was impressed with his combination of skills and tenacity.
Callahan was happy to see him join the Lightning, too.
""He has a high level of compete, is a bigger guy who has a really good set of hands,"" Callahan said. ""He's a guy who brings a lot to our team on the wing, just his size and his physicality, and his skill too.""
In the case of Girardi and McDonagh, the Lightning are trying to re-create the past. For years, this duo was one of the most effective shutdown pairings in the NHL. When they played together in New York last season, it appeared the magic was gone: They had a minus-5.62 Corsi percentage relative to their teammates, and were a minus-4 in even-strength goal differential. The numbers haven't been stellar in Tampa yet, either: a minus-6.38 relative Corsi percentage and a minus-4 goal differential.
But the team hopes their familiarity breeds competence.
""It is weird sometimes when me and him go out there for a shift,"" said Girardi. ""I get bought out last summer. I'm in Tampa. Everything is going well. Once the rumor mill started flying I was like 'Huh ... maybe we'll land this guy here.'""

Before conversations with Eddie Olczyk of NBC Sports and Golden Knights LW Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, Greg Wyshynski and Emily Kaplan discuss what changes they would make to the current playoff format and share the teams they're most disappointed in this season. Plus, we have our first rebuttal in the ""ESPN On Ice Rant Line."" Listen »
McDonagh said Girardi was the first text he received from Rangers South, around 30 minutes after the trade first hit. ""He was pumped to see me join the team,"" said McDonagh.
In turn, McDonagh was pumped to see him again.
""He was the guy I looked up to when I first joined the Rangers as a rookie,"" said McDonagh, who is five years younger than Girardi. ""And he's a guy today that comes to the rink and puts in the hours that he needs to prepare himself, to play the way he needs to play. And that's what I learned from him. He's a warrior. A great leader to learn from.""
Girardi played the role of locker room ambassador for both McDonagh and Miller, as well as concierge for the off-ice needs.
""I've only been here three-quarters of a year, but I try to help them out. They're asking me where to take the dog, and all that stuff. Little things I know now. When I came in, I knew Cally and Strals. You come to a new team, and you're already in with the guys. You have a liaison kind of thing,"" he said.
Miller appreciated it.
""It can be intimidating going into a team not knowing anybody. It's a different atmosphere. So to be able to come in and know a lot of the guys, take me under their wings a little bit, it's huge,"" he said.
On March 28, these former Rangers returned to their old stomping grounds, and Girardi and McDonagh went to their old coffee grounds: a Starbucks located near MSG.
Did the barista give them any returning-to-hometown discount?
""I wish,"" Girardi said with a laugh.
The two were quickly spotted by Rangers fans, who welcomed them back and asked for photos. ""There was a girl in a Jimmy Vesey jersey that recognized us right away,"" said Girardi. ""Not sure why she has his jersey, but I'll deal with that later.""
McDonagh said that returning to MSG in a visiting jersey was surreal, if only because he wasn't sure where the visiting dressing room was located. He's still getting acclimated to his new home, too. ""It's a different lifestyle, that's for sure. New York is a big city. [Tampa] is a small city. And I'm getting used to the climate change,"" he said.
The former Rangers are buddies of varying degrees. Girardi and McDonagh are tight. Stralman admitted that he didn't keep in close touch with them after heading to Tampa. Miller said they're all friends, but they're also in different phases of their lives.
""A lot of them have kids. When we're done, it's family time. I mean, it's been nice on the road, but we all have separate lives,"" said Miller, at 25 the youngest of the group.
What they share is a bond forged with the Rangers, and a common goal to lead the Lightning to the Stanley Cup they fell just short of in New York. McDonagh hopes they'll eventually be known for what they accomplished in Tampa, rather than from where they all pulled up roots.
""If you ask me, I hope that doesn't stick too much longer. I'm proud to be part of this team. Proud to be part of the Tampa Bay Lightning,"" he said.
But, in the end, there's always going to be a little part of the Rangers they'll carry with them.
""I bled blue for 11 years,"" said Girardi, glancing at his similarly colored Lightning gear. ""Well, I mean, I guess I'm still bleeding blue.""

Marchand has 84 points in 64 games this season, the kind of performance that has sparked MVP talk and has helped the Bruins push to the top of the Eastern Conference. He's also been suspended twice in the past 12 months, including a five-game ban this season for an elbow to the head of Marcus Johansson of the New Jersey Devils, and fined twice since Jan. 2017, including supplemental discipline for a dangerous trip on Niklas Kronwall of the Detroit Red Wings.
For his career, Marchand has been suspended six times, losing 75 games and surrendering over $1.7 million.
But the NHL Department of Player Safety didn't suspend him for the cross-check on MacDonald, opting instead to fine Marchand $5,000 for the incident that occurred at 18:55 of the second period in the Flyers' 4-3 overtime win:

- Broad Street Hockey (@BroadStHockey) April 1, 2018
Why a fine and not a suspension?
According to the Department of Player Safety, they felt the incident itself didn't rise to that status, that the cross-check didn't connect with MacDonald as badly as the video might indicate, for whatever reason -- good fortune on MacDonald's part, or Marchand pulling up at the last moment. And the brunt of the impact was to his visor.
The way the department approaches repeat, repeat, repeat (etc.) offenders like Marchand isn't to automatically suspend them for acts that appear to cross the line. Instead, the history of a player's supplemental discipline is factored in during the punitive phase of the ruling.
Where this philosophy gets a little tricky is in the realm of intent. It's obvious Marchand snaps in that moment, and it's obvious that he's making an attempt to cross-check an opponent in the head. If the aim of the Department of Player Safety is to change behavior as much as it's to appropriately punish injurious plays, should a play like this really just result in a fine because Marchand's attempt to injure was botched?
Wouldn't at least a one-game ""check yourself"" suspension here have been warranted?
We'd say this is the most baffling moment involving Brad Marchand and supplemental discipline this season, but that would be a disservice to his being the sanctioned court jester of the NHL All-Star Weekend while serving a suspension for concussing an opponent who ended up missing 31 games.

The hieroglyphics can be found adorning the tombs at Egypt's ancient Beni Hassan burial site. They depict two men, each holding a long palm-tree branch, with slightly curved ends. They're pointing them at the ground, crossing one over the other.
Ignore the desert garb, and it almost looks like they're taking a hockey faceoff. There's an ancestral reason for this: Ancient Egyptians created a game in which sticks were used to smack around a semicircle created from papyrus fibers wrapped in leather.
In essence, Sameh Ramadan isn't trying to bring hockey to the Egyptian pyramids. He's trying to bring it back. 
Ramadan is the president of Egypt Ice Hockey as well as a captain for its national club team, which will compete in the first Arab Club Cup Championship beginning April 3 in Abu Dhabi. It's a tournament that seeks to spotlight the hockey programs of Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco, the only nation among the group currently recognized by the International Ice Hockey Federation.
""This tournament is a coming-out party for all these teams on an international stage,"" Ramadan said.
It's another step forward for the nascent hockey program in Egypt, which is seeking an endorsement from the nation's governing sports bodies as its official national hockey team, which is necessary for application to the IIHF. To be granted membership, Ramadan has to prove the program's viability, relevance and capacity for growth.
""Basically, all I need now is a letter from my sports minister that says, 'Egypt Ice Hockey represents the ice hockey interests of Egypt.' No money involved. Just saying the IIHF can talk to us. And then we can put in an application,"" Ramadan said.Egypt Ice Hockey's sweaters sport one of hockey's most memorable logos: the image of a pharaoh wearing a ""Friday The 13th""-style goalie mask. Egypt Ice Hockey
In other words, Hockey Egypt has to get these gatekeepers' attention. That is why it is playing a game at the pyramids.
""We're trying to get a full-sized rink. As of now, it's going to be synthetic, for budget reasons, but we're trying to get the sponsorships to do a full ice rink. We're trying to target December or January in the event we can do an ice rink because it's cold enough,"" said Ramadan, who said several sign-offs from the government are required before the game can happen.
Other events have been held at the pyramids -- everything from a David Guetta rave to an international squash tournament. But never hockey. Well, at least not since B.C.
""Hockey being played in front of the pyramids ... that would be an iconic image. That would sweep the globe,"" said Rob Ruszala of The Hockey Foundation.
Ruszala would know about playing hockey in iconic places. The last game he organized made the Guinness Book of World Records.
The Hockey Foundation is a New York-based nonprofit organization that seeks to support and grow the sport in emerging communities. In places such as, for example, the Himalayan region of Ladakh, India, where The Hockey Foundation helped facilitate a world record for the highest-altitude hockey game, at 14,340 feet above sea level.
""Our pilot program was in the Indian Himalayas,"" Ruszala said. ""The motivation behind this is that India does not have a regulation-sized rink in its entire country. So we were able to procure the boards, ship them over and donate them to the program. So we staged the Himalayan game to bring more interest to their developing program, but the long-lasting effect was to have a regulation-sized rink in the country.""
When it comes to a game at the pyramids, it's not simply for the stunning visuals and novelty of the stunt. ""We're not doing it for the photo op. We're doing it for the legacy impact,"" he said.
The legacy of hockey in Egypt is one of humble beginnings.Egypt has a population of 98.9 million people but only three ice rinks, none of them regulation size and all of them housed within shopping malls in Cairo. Egypt Ice Hockey
Ramadan's parents lived in a suburb of Cairo, and the family's apartment was across the street from one of the three ice rinks in Egypt. The rinks are what one might expect them to be: each located within a mall in Cairo, each about 25 percent the size of an NHL rink (or about 300 meters long), with no Zambonis or even skate sharpeners.
""Two of our players had never had their skates sharpened,"" Ramadan said of his national club team. ""But you'd be shocked: Because they played on such crappy ice all the time, they were able to get up to speed quickly. [Seeing them on groomed, regulation ice] was like watching ducks fly for the first time.""
The rink near his parents' home opened in 1997. Ramadan remembers asking his cousin to bring some hockey equipment to his apartment so they could go across the street and play.
His experience shows hockey's place in Egyptian culture just 20 years ago. ""We tried getting on the ice [with equipment], and the security guard stopped us,"" Ramadan said. ""He thought we were carrying weapons. No one had any idea what hockey was.""
Fast-forward to 2016. Ramadan is living in New Jersey and a father of two daughters. His friend Yasser Ahmed, the Egyptian national team's goalie and director of hockey operations, discovered that there was an actual hockey team playing at the old rink in Cairo: The Anubis Club, a group of local players and a program completely anonymous to the local populace.
""Back in 2004, we went to play at a rink, and it just so happened that some Egyptians joined us. And we ended up with a nice little group,"" Mike Letanzey, a Canadian ex-pat, told CGTN in 2017.
Ramadan, who has an MBA in marketing, reached out to the team. To get noticed, he reasoned, they needed to rebrand. The team became Egypt Ice Hockey, sporting one of the most memorable logos in the world: the image of a pharaoh wearing a ""Friday The 13th""-style goalie mask.Egypt Ice Hockey players (from left) Sameh Ramadan, Emir Elkholy, Yasser Ahmed and Ryan Elkholy visited the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, where the goalie stick Ahmed used in the 2016 African Club Cup was on display alongside Auston Matthews' jersey. Egypt Ice Hockey
By July 2016, Egypt was playing in its first international ice hockey tournament: the African Ice Hockey Cup for club teams, held in Morocco. (The tournament had the support of the Czech Republic ice hockey federation, which even donated a bus with Jaromir Jagr's image on its side.) The rink's size allowed for only 3-on-3 hockey -- the only regulation-sized rink on the continent is located in South Africa -- and the Egyptians were, well, very much the newbies there. ""We had no business being there with that specific team,"" Ramadan said.
But the trip changed the course of Egyptian ice hockey -- thanks, in part, to Reddit.
A man from the American embassy showed up at the Moroccan club tournament, asking to buy a Team Egypt jersey. Ramadan was shocked by this happenstance and asked how the man knew about the team. It turns out the Egyptian national team had gone viral on the Reddit hockey board, thanks to its unique branding. It was at that moment, Ramadan says, that everything clicked: a collection of ex-pats and club players could be Egypt's national team, and together they could push for IIHF recognition.
That tournament is also where they hooked up with The Hockey Foundation.
Ruszala sat down with Ramadan and Ahmed about 18 months ago to begin formulating a plan for how to support and grow hockey in Egypt. It was clear, right away, that viable gear was the most pressing issue -- including, for example, giving the goaltenders something more than shin guards.
""They only had one set of goalie pads, and every game they'd only have one goalie suit up. Mite or adult, it didn't matter because it was one set of pads. I was floored by that,"" Ruszala said.
Within a month, Hockey Foundation sent six sets of pads. Then came at least 100 other pieces of equipment, used gear the Foundation had collected in the U.S. and Canada. Sending it to Egypt proved costly, especially with local tariffs. ""People don't realize it costs up to $400 to finally get it into the hands of wherever its headed,"" Ruszala said. ""We're hoping the sport revs up big enough that we can start sending over bulk shipments.""Egypt's first foray into international hockey came at the inaugural African Ice Hockey Cup for club teams in Morocco in July 2016.

Getting it revved up depends largely on getting Egypt to sign off on hockey officially and then investing in it. Ramadan, ever the marketing guy, decided that his best shot at this wasn't to narrowly pitch hockey to the Youth Sports Minister and the national government. At the World Youth Forum last November, he made his pitch for a full winter sports federation that would include hockey.
""I don't want to just grow ice hockey in Egypt. I want to grow a winter sports federation,"" Ramadan said. ""I told them to build me a rink, and I would have speedskating and curling and figuring skating and ice hockey all under one roof.""
He doesn't want all of this opportunity just for men and boys, either. Ramadan has a 10-year-old daughter who plays goalie and an 8-year-old daughter who's a forward. Kuwait and UAE have women's teams, and he feels it's essential that Egypt get women involved in winter sports as well.
""It's Egypt. It's a Muslim country. We want to promote women participating,"" he said, pointing to the recent visit by members of the UAE women's team to the Washington Capitals, with culminated with forward Fatima Al Ali dropping the ceremonial puck at a game while wearing a Capitals jersey and a hijab.
Ruszala said that participation of women in hockey is one of the harbingers The Hockey Foundation looks for in measuring the growth of an emerging hockey market. ""It's not just for boys. It's all-inclusive,"" he said.Ramadan wants to make sure women get involved in winter sports in Egypt, as they have in some other Arab countries. UAE forward Fatima Al Ali, right, practiced with Alex Ovechkin and other Capitals players during a visit to Washington, D.C., in 2017. John McDonnell / The Washington Post via Getty Images
They want to see more participants, not only on teams but also at clinics. ""If we're investing time and equipment and the numbers are stagnant, maybe that region isn't ready for the sport yet,"" Ruszala said.
But the last requirement is, at this point, the trickiest one for Egyptian hockey: formal recognition.
""In Egypt's case, they're like an NCAA club right now,"" Ruszala said. ""They need to be formally recognized by the ministry of sport as the chief representatives of hockey in Egypt.""
Which brings us back to the pyramids.
Erica Jong once referred to jealousy as ""all the fun you think they had."" No matter what the level of play in a game at the pyramids might look like, the fact is that one will have been played there. Ruszala has already seen the effect a game in one country can have on another.
""The Pakistanis reached out to us after the India game,"" he said.
The pyramids game isn't just about the growth of hockey in Egypt, though Ramadan sees it as an essential step forward down that path. It's about making a statement in Africa and the Middle East about the viability of the game, the continuing effort to alert the region to hockey's presence and how it fits into their changing approach to sports.
""A lot of countries just focus on the sports where they have the best chance to medal and not the recreational aspects of the sport, which is where hockey in Egypt is,"" Ruszala said. ""Sport for recreation and sport for competition are relatively new concepts.""
As is hockey.
""It's a new concept. It's a novel concept. But it's not an unfamiliar concept,"" he said. ""Skating they get, but now there's an educational barrier. So this can't be a one-off novelty.""
Ramadan can feel the momentum. The Arab Club Cup will bolster Egypt's profile. So did his team's gear going viral, both on Reddit and in photographs such as this one, which was featured on TSN and shows Adrian Mizzi, a man who goes by the nickname ""The Travelling Goalie,"" suited up in the desert wearing team gear:
 Adrian Mizzi the traveling goalie has arrived in Egypt.
A post shared by  EgyptIceHockey (@egypticehockey) on Apr 25, 2017 at 7:19am PDT
So will a game at the pyramids. Ramadan has been overwhelmed by the team's growth in the past two years and equally overwhelmed by how that support has sliced through cultural barriers like ... well, like a curved palm tree branch smacking around a leather-bound papyrus ball.
""The minute they hear about us, they forget about an African or a Middle Eastern country. They hear 'Egypt' and they're immediately supportive,"" he said. ""With the team we have in place, we've been able to raise the profile of hockey Egypt -- to the point where we even have a few articles in the Hockey Hall of Fame.""
Entombed in that temple of hockey in Toronto are a goalie stick Ahmed used in the Moroccan team and gear from Ramadan.
""My stick is by an Auston Matthews jersey,"" he said.

The ESPN FC panel break down the instant impact Zlatan Ibrahimovic made for the LA Galaxy and what he offers MLS in the long term. (4:10)
Zlatan Ibrahimovic isn't the first player to score multiple goals in his MLS debut. In fact, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, 15 other players have duplicated the feat, including five in the past decade. That said, Ibrahimovic's performance in the LA Galaxy's 4-3 comeback win over LAFC on Saturday will go down as the most memorable.
The last player to make that kind of entrance was striker Jermain Defoe, who bagged two goals for Toronto FC against Seattle on opening day in 2014. Fredy Montero scored twice for the Seattle Sounders against the New York Red Bulls in 2009 in what was not only his MLS debut, but the team's as well. On March 19, 2011, there was a near epidemic of MLS debut doubles, with Kansas City's Omar Bravo, the Vancouver Whitecaps' Eric Hassli and D.C United's Charlie Davies all scoring twice. Davies, like Ibrahimovic, even managed to get his two as a substitute.
Suffice it to say, none of those garnered near the attention -- before or after -- nor did they carry with them the expectations that Ibrahimovic did on Saturday. Ibrahimovic isn't necessarily being asked to resurrect a franchise. Manager Sigi Schmid's remodeling project has been going on the entire offseason. But the Swede is being tasked with moving the needle in a city saturated with sports entertainment opportunities. No pressure there.
Saturday was also the occasion of the first L.A. derby between the Galaxy and expansion side LAFC -- ""El Trafico,"" as it has now been dubbed -- and for the better part of an hour, it looked like the upstarts would end up celebrating a famous victory. By now, everyone knows what happened next: Ibrahimovic's sublimely struck 40-yard rocket to equalize in the 77th minute, followed by his header just seconds into stoppage time.
And so a Galaxy legend has been born in just over 20 on-field minutes, an achievement that other high-profile players arriving in MLS have taken much longer to attain. David Villa didn't score in his debut for New York City FC. The same is true for the Galaxy's David Beckham, the Chicago Fire's Cuauhtemoc Blanco and the Red Bulls' Thierry Henry, though both Blanco and Henry recorded at least one assist. About the only player who made a splash similar to Ibrahimovic was Didier Drogba, who while failing to score in his first match as a substitute for the Montreal Impact against the Philadelphia Union, bagged a hat trick in his first start against the Chicago Fire.
Of course, the vast majority of those players went on to live up to the hype that their designated player salaries warranted. Villa is a two-time Best XI and league MVP winner. Beckham overcame some early stumbles to win two MLS Cup titles with the Galaxy. Blanco and Henry were both MVP finalists during their respective tenures in the league. Contrast those performances with the likes of New York City FC's Andrea Pirlo and the Galaxy's Steven Gerrard, who arrived -- Gerrard even scored in his debut -- but ultimately contributed little.
Without question, Ibrahimovic's performance Saturday was pure, unabashed fun, one of those matches with which people will regale their grandchildren in years to come. But contributing over a sustained period will ultimately be Ibrahimovic's biggest challenge. So far, it's one he looks up for meeting.
For all the clever one-liners he has delivered since arriving Thursday, Ibrahimovic has mixed in some humility as well. Could it be an act, one that is due to evaporate once the reality of substandard teammates and cross-country flights sets in? It's possible, but Ibrahimovic's body language so far suggests otherwise in a way reminiscent of Beckham's last few years in MLS.
For all the airbrushing of history about Beckham's time with the Galaxy, the reality is that in the early years of the deal, the Galaxy needed Beckham more than he needed them, and it showed. This manifested itself in Beckham's decision to go on multiple loans, even if it meant missing large chunks of the MLS season. It was a bad look for the team and the league.
That all changed when Beckham tore his Achilles tendon, putting an end to his aspirations of playing in the 2010 World Cup. He realized the Galaxy and MLS could actually give him something beyond a paycheck, and his commitment level increased. Galaxy fans that at one point scorned him over his loans were eventually converted.
While the Ibrahimovic situation isn't identical to that of Beckham, the serious knee injury he sustained nearly a year ago provides a similarity. Yes, MLS is a clear step down from the Premier League, but there is still plenty to be gained from playing for the Galaxy. As Ibrahimovic has said more than once since arriving in L.A., this latest adventure gives him an opportunity to enjoy the simple things that the game gives him, to ""smell the grass, appreciate the ball, to touch it, to kick it.""
And on days like Saturday, it can give him the kind of buzz that players and fans live for. That bodes well for both Ibrahimovic and the Galaxy.

From Jozy Altidore's brace to Zlatan Ibrahimovic's unforgettable debut, relive all the goals from the fifth round of MLS action. (1:30)
A look at how the teams in Major League Soccer stack up after Week 5 of the season:
1. New York City FC (+1)
Back to the top of the charts for Patrick Vieira's team, which showed again that it can win without David Villa. The ability to get goals from players all over the field is a big reason NYCFC is so good on the road in a league where that's a very difficult thing to be.
2. Atlanta United (+3)
United pulled off another win on the road in Minnesota -- this one a little different than last year's romp -- but might be missing Leandro Gonzalez-Pirez next week due to his red card. To be successful in MLS, a team has to know how to win ugly. This was certainly the case for Atlanta.
3. Columbus Crew SC (-2)
Defensive lapses at home against Vancouver doomed the Crew and put the first real black mark on their season to date. Columbus controlled nearly every aspect of the game but couldn't keep out the Whitecaps' two best chances on the day.
4. LAFC (no change)
After a dominant opening 45 minutes in Carson, LAFC got Zlatan'd. Bob Bradley's task now is to keep the stunning defeat from becoming a psychological blow that sends the team spiraling. Saturday's collapse can't be placed at the feet of the attack, which remains excellent.
5. New York Red Bulls (-2)
Considering how physical things got against Orlando on Saturday, Jesse Marsch was probably right to rotate his squad ahead of the CCL semifinal first leg this week. Marsch has reason to be upset with the refereeing after a wild game decided by a single goal.
6. Vancouver Whitecaps (+4)
As statement wins go, the Caps' 2-1 victory over the Crew is emphatic. Kei Kamara showed why he's the most dangerous man in MLS with his head and Vancouver beat the hottest team in the league on the road. Although his goal was taken off the board, Alphonso Davies showed his immense talent again.
7. Toronto FC (-1)
Friday's triumph over RSL at BMO Field certainly felt like a message from the champs. Dominant or not, the Reds jump-started the league campaign with three needed points. Even better that the win came despite Greg Vanney resting several defensive starters ahead of the Champions League this week.
8. Sporting Kansas City (-1)
Sighs of relief in Kansas City. It seems Sporting does remember how to play defense: A clean sheet against goal-shy D.C. United might not be a lot to crow about, but after giving up nine goals in the first three games, keeping any opponent off the board is something to be encouraged by.
9. Houston Dynamo (no change)
The Dynamo got a dose of their own medicine at home in a loss to New England on Saturday, as the Revs used the counter to win in Houston. Oscar Pareja's team created plenty of danger in the early going, but it was the visitors who made their breakout chances count. Home has not been kind to Houston since Week 1.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice off the bench in his MLS debut to lead LA Galaxy past LAFC after trailing 3-0 in the clubs' first ever meeting.
10. LA Galaxy (+3)
Welcome to Zlatan. Need we say anything else? His stunning debut in MLS showed that he's still got plenty to offer, and it's exactly what Sigi Schmid's side needs.
11. New England Revolution (+7)
What a player the Revs look to have in Cristian Penilla. The Ecuadorian was the difference for New England on the road in Houston, setting up Teal Bunbury's opener on a killer counterattack before scoring himself with an impressive bit of skill.
12. Montreal Impact (+5)
The Impact scored a big road win against the Sounders on Saturday. It doesn't matter how you win on the road in MLS, and no one will call Montreal's 1-0 victory ""pretty."" Perhaps the lone pretty part was Ignacio Piatti setting up Jeisson Vargas' goal with a dance through the Sounders' defense in the 60th minute.
13. San Jose Earthquakes (-2)
In a game of two halves, the Quakes were undone by the second 45 against NYCFC. If not for Sean Johnson, Mikael Stahre's team might have gotten the win. Despite moments of brightness in the early part of the season, the Quakes have a disappointing three points from three matches.
14. Minnesota United (-2)
Francisco Calvo's lament about the league paying more attention to some teams than others rings a bit hollow in the aftermath of a Loons loss to an Atlanta team that played down a man for more than 50 minutes. No one knows quite what he has left, but Darwin Quintero cannot get on the field soon enough as far as Minnesota's attack is concerned.
15. Real Salt Lake (-1)
RSL was no fan of Alan Chapman's refereeing on Friday night in Toronto. Both penalty calls against the visitors were questionable at best, and RSL couldn't find a way back into the game until it was too late. The lone bright spot was Corey Baird's goal, a first-ever MLS tally for the homegrown signing.
16. Philadelphia Union (-1)
The Union's task this week was a difficult one, playing in frigid conditions at altitude in Commerce City. Still, Jim Curtin can't be happy with a second half that saw his club give up a hat trick to Dominique Badji. The three-goal loss won't do a lot for the young defensive group that Curtin rolled out against the Rapids.
Dominique Badji scored a hat trick to lead Colorado past Philadelphia for their first win of 2018.
17. Seattle Sounders (-9)
Nobody is having fun in Seattle, and while the injury problem gives Brian Schmetzer cover for the time being, the fight against panic will be a hard one. The Sounders still don't have a goal in 2018 through three games. Maybe the two weeks before a trip to Kansas City will help.
18. FC Dallas (-2)
No match for FC Dallas this week, so they lose a bit of ground to the surrounding pack.
19. Orlando City (+3)
""Cathartic"" is a good way to describe a wild win for the Lions at home against the Red Bulls on Saturday. No one on the Orlando side will care that they didn't face New York's best lineup, or that they shipped three goals to a group that didn't include Tyler Adams or Bradley Wright-Phillips to start. Sacha Kljestan gets a measure of revenge against the team that traded him.
20. Portland Timbers (-1)
Portland had Giovanni Savarese's first win in its sights on the road in Chicago before conceding a late equalizer to Brandon Vincent. The Timbers are just one spot off the bottom of the Western Conference table, but a point in Chicago, disappointing as it might be, represents incremental progress.
21. D.C. United (-1)
United's defense isn't terrible, but that doesn't matter much when the attack is so poor. D.C.'s trip to Kansas City was 87 minutes of frustration after an early Felipe Gutierrez tally for the home side. We can't forget that the schedule is rough for United, who will sit out next weekend before a home match in Annapolis on April 14.
22. Colorado Rapids (+1)
The Rapids won for the first time under Anthony Hudson on Saturday thanks to a hat trick from Dominique Badji. Colorado created good chances even before Badji's second-half breakthrough, encouraging signs for a Rapids team that doesn't have a lot of expectations in 2018.
23. Chicago Fire (-2)
The Fire out-passed, out-possessed and out-shot the Timbers but only came away with a point from Saturday's tilt. On the bright side, Bastian Schweinsteiger looks spry; the German played a role in both Chicago goals, slaloming around defenders before the eventual equalizer.

Relive some of the memorable Champions League quarterfinal fixtures from the past five campaigns, including Cristiano Ronaldo's five goal haul versus Bayern. (1:38)
Already I can imagine fans of hundreds of smaller clubs all around the world getting out the smallest violins in history to sarcastically mimic a song of sympathy, but ahead of the Spanish, European and world champions facing Juventus this week, my argument is that Real Madrid don't get enough respect.
""Boo-hoo, cry me a river."" I know, I know.
So many who have to suffer relegation battles, dream of a trophy every eight years -- rather than the eight Madrid have lifted since Zinedine Zidane took over. Anyone whose team has conceded five or six at the Santiago Bernabeu will be spluttering into your coffee and doughnuts right now.
Madrid are wealthy, they are mega-successful, they are privileged. Ninety-nine percent of teams they compete against firmly believe that Madrid get friendly refereeing decisions in their favour. As a club, they enjoy huge swathes of favourable, you might even say biased, newspaper and media coverage -- they are the establishment.
But they merit oodles more kudos than they actually get for their domination of the Champions League in the past four years.
Ask almost anyone this week: ""Are Madrid going to the final again?"" and unless they are wearing a black-and-white Vecchia Signora football strip and worshiping posters of Giorgio Chiellini and Paulo Dybala, then they'll likely shrug their shoulders, nod and answer: ""They're Madrid -- it's what they do!""
Resignation, complacency, expectation. No sense of awe that Zidane's squad is, arguably, just three good performances from winning a third straight Champions League. Precious little admiration that a team that couldn't cope with Girona away or Real Betis at home this season is suddenly in shape to dismantle Paris Saint-Germain and also fully capable of eliminating their recurring bete noire, Juventus.
A squad that was at 6s and 7s in terms of attitude, fitness, form, competitive aggression and reliability on either side of the turn of the year is now regularly turning out devastating attacking football, has almost all of its top 18 players on blistering form and goes to Turin bristling with self-belief and ambition.
Listen up, people: it's specifically not a lesser, easier-to-ignore phenomenon when a club consistently reaches the elite European final and wins it. This isn't hum-drum, this is history.
This isn't a byproduct of some institutional favouritism, this is finesse and deeply embedded competitive aggression. We should venerate it for what it is -- absolutely remarkable.
I'm pretty sure that I know the reasons that Los Blancos aren't always given their dues: everyone likes to see giants fall. Underdogs are romantic.
It's also, admittedly, to Los Blancos' detriment that they have only won their national title eight times in the past 28 years -- not a great return -- and only retained the Spanish championship once in that period. That certainly undermines the sheen of a club's credibility.
More, when some of Madrid's lap-dog media trumpet their bias and ridicule other teams, it grates. Some parts of an audience that might otherwise admire, turn their heads and affections away.
Also, people seem to find the caricatures easier to dislike than it is to laud or admire the real characters. Cristiano Ronaldo is a proven phenomenon, possessed of one of the great sporting mentalities we've ever seen.
But the haters have him down as a preener, a diva -- nothing more than an egotist.
Sergio Ramos is cut from similar cloth. Innately athletic, innately a leader, ferociously competitive, but also very football savvy, indeed. When he first moved to Madrid, as Florentino Perez's debut Spanish signing, he appalled the old guard by immediately declaring that he wanted to inherit Fernando Hierro's No. 4, and that he wanted, in due course, to mean the same to the club as the brilliant Andaluz sweeper had done.
And, hey, look now. Ramos has indeed become, I'd argue, just as iconic, just as important to Madrid as his one-time idol was. It's a massive achievement.
However, he's more likely to be pilloried for his perpetual love of a red card in La Liga, mocked for his increasingly vibrant fashion sense or dragged into yet another ""will they, won't they"" in his trumped-up love-hate relationship with Gerard Pique.
Then there's the nonsense that Zidane always has to face.
If he resuscitates Marco Asensio and once again trains him up to look like the next great Spanish international, then, immediately, that's obscured by the tsunami of stories that Isco is being ignored or badly treated or punished. Yin, but no yang.
So far we haven't had anything suggesting that Zidane is in the huff because Isco once named his dog ""Messi,"" but expect that any day.
Instead of being quizzed, routinely, about what it takes to fine tune the tactics, rest, training, mental recuperation, competitive hunger and squad morale in order to coach Madrid to three out of the past four Champions League titles; the Frenchman is badgered about signing Neymar. This is a player who is injured, contracted to PSG, doesn't have a buyout clause and who chose not to join Madrid on the two occasions when he clearly could have done: 2013 and last summer.
Juventus and Real Madrid clash in a rematch of last year's UCL final, relive the two clubs history in the knockout round.
I'm old enough to remember the last time a club won three European Cups in a row -- not that Madrid have achieved that in the Champions League just yet. First Ajax, then Bayern Munich in a straight line from 1971 until 1976.
Yes there was jealousy, certainly some fans of other clubs resented them, but they were venerated. The star players became iconic, in name, shirt number and haircut.
These Madrid stars are marketed, sponsored and squeezed for financial return until their pips squeak, and the mass-media era means that they are much better known than Johnny Rep or Uli Hoeness were back then. But are Zidane & Co. given as much respect, constructively analysed for their remarkable achievements? I think not.
While they've made Europe kneel, since 2014 (pound for pound, I'm hardly forgetting Barcelona's 2015 treble) Zidane, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale, Keylor Navas, Raphael Varane, Ramos, Ronaldo, Isco, Lucas Vazquez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric et al. have served us up every conceivable type of sporting spectacle.
Very few results, in the entire history of the European Cup and Champions League have stunned the football world like Bayern Munich 0-4 Real Madrid in 2014. Especially after the tight, evenly balanced first leg at the Bernabeu, which Pep Guardiola's team could easily have won.
Add that to the eliminations of Schalke and Dortmund, and Madrid won their knockout rounds against top German opposition that season on a 17-3 aggregate. Impressive, not to say epic.
Atletico outplayed them for 89 minutes in the Lisbon final that year, but if you want ultradrama, don't go to the cinema or Netflix -- just follow Ramos' career. You know the goal I mean.
The 2015-16 campaign might have provided fewer elite moments, but Ronaldo's hat trick to haul Madrid back from the precipice of 2-0 down to Wolfsburg will not easily slip the mind. Then the pageant of colour, noise and football culture in Milan, where it was the second Madrid derbi in two seasons, was a spectacle. Believe me.
Last year saw Napoli utterly demolished, an all-time European classic in the quarterfinal as it ebbed back and forth whether Madrid or Bayern would reach the last four, and then -- again -- a Ronaldo semifinal hat trick to rob poor old Atleti of their last shreds of romanticism or hope. The Cardiff final was brimful of great goals, titanic competitive spirit and, ultimately, one of the great European Cup/Champions League showpiece displays.
Now Juve are back, doggedly. And many are suggesting that they'll be firmer, more streetwise rivals than Massimiliano Allegri managed to make them last June. Maybe so, maybe so.
For my money, though, Madrid aren't just the holders -- they're the group of players who know, and show, how to get the job done.
They win, stay hungry, win, stay hungry, win and then win again. It's remarkable. It's historic, and whether you like them, hate them, resent them, support them ... it's simply admirable.

Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United's performance in the first half against Swansea was one of the best at the club since he arrived. (0:39)
MANCHESTER, England -- Manchester United are targeting younger fans in a bid to improve the atmosphere at Old Trafford.
The club will offer thousands of discounted tickets for supporters between 18 and 25 in the hope they will help raise the noise levels at home games in the wake of criticism from manager Jose Mourinho, who has branded Old Trafford ""a quiet stadium"" this season.
United hope to boost the atmosphere by offering £15 tickets to younger fans in the lower tier of the Stretford End.
It is part of their plans for next season that has seen the club freeze season ticket prices for the seventh year in a row.
""The club enjoys unparalleled support and we recognise the sacrifice many fans make to watch the team home and away,"" group managing director Richard Arnold said in a statement. ""Continuing the freeze in match and season tickets for next season is driven by our belief in supporting fans attending our games.
""The introduction of reduced ticket prices for young adults in the Stretford End lower tier stems from suggestions generated by fan groups through our Fans' Forum, aimed at building on the tradition of vibrant support.""

Steve Nicol explains why Mohamed Salah deserves player-of-the-year accolades over Kevin De Bruyne, despite Manchester City running away with the Premier League. (1:01)
Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne has stated his case to be named the Premier League's Player of the Year, but acknowledged Liverpool's Mohamed Salah would be a worthy winner as well.
De Bruyne has been the driving force behind City's runaway league campaign. Pep Guardiola's men sit 16 points ahead of second-placed Manchester United with a chance to clinch the title this weekend with a win over their city rivals at the Etihad.
The Belgium international has been in wonderful form all season, providing a league-high 15 assists to go along with seven goals and numerous impressive displays from midfield.
""In one way I believe I deserve it, because I have been very consistent in my form. I am very happy with myself,"" De Bruyne said of winning the award. ""I am very pleased with how I have played and I didn't expect to be this good this season to be honest.
""There is almost no game where my standard has dropped, so I have been very constant. To maintain the level in the amount of games I have played, the amount of minutes, I am very pleased with that.""
Liverpool's Salah is on pace to break the Prem's single-season goals record in what has become a remarkable breakout season for the former Chelsea castoff.
His 29 goals from 31 appearances are four more than Harry Kane, his next closest competitor. Salah has also added nine assists but De Bruyne said comparing the two players' resumes is difficult.
""You cannot compare, it is impossible,"" De Bruyne said. ""Everybody has his own opinion. It depends on what people are looking for in a player.
""Salah has been on a remarkable goalscoring run and he plays very well in an inside forward type of role. This season he has been incredible, so to compare us, I don't know.
""With the statistics, how are we going to compare ourselves? It's totally different.
""I played at the weekend like a defensive midfielder, so how you can compare me to an inside forward? I have no idea.
""But Salah has been outstanding, his record speaks for itself. It's just the way it goes. Luckily I don't have to make the decision.""

Arsene Wenger was unhappy with Arsenal's first half performance against Stoke City on Sunday despite a 3-0 win. (0:39)
Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has blasted Samir Nasri as ""an idiot"" and told the Telegraph that Arsene Wenger is the best manager a young player can have.
Frimpong, 26, also praised former teammate Cesc Fabregas as ""a lovely guy,"" revealed that Alex Song always ate KFC the day before a game and that Andrey Arshavin didn't care much for training.
He became a cult figure at Arsenal despite a short-lived career that only included six league appearances in the 2011-12 season.
The tough-tackling defensive midfielder recalled how Wenger stayed calm after he was sent off for a needless second booking against Liverpool in a 2-0 loss, but said that incident led to him falling out with Nasri for good.
""When the game ended, we were in the dressing room and I expected Wenger to be really angry,"" Frimpong said. ""He was actually very calm, but for some reason, Nasri came in and he was like: 'We lost the game because of you.' I was a young guy, didn't really know what I was doing, and was devastated. I felt like I'd let everybody down and he was really blaming me, so I really didn't like him.
""He always had a go at me if I gave the ball away in training and even said to me once: 'I could buy you if I want.' To be honest, he probably could have done at the time, but still.""
That animosity showed when Nasri returned to the Emirates as a Manchester City player and the two clashed on the pitch with some heated exchanges.
""People never really understand why that [fight] happened but I don't like the guy,"" Frimpong said. ""The reason I don't like him is because he's an idiot. Plain and simple. I would never, ever have respect for him.""
Although Frimpong never established himself in Wenger's squad but he praised the manager for being so patient with young players.
""As a young guy, he's the best manager you could ever have,"" Frimpong said. ""I've never come across another manager who's so calm and understanding. He only shouted at me once, when I did something wrong in training after turning up late.""
Frimpong, who is currently without a club after stints in the Swedish and Cypriot leagues, had better things to say about other teammates.
""Fabregas was such a lovely guy,"" he said. ""When I got moved to the first team, he said, 'Frimpong, you've been promoted, well done!' It was such a nice touch. He was a very, very lovely guy.
""Then there was Song, who used to go to KFC before every home game. On the bus to the team hotel the night before the game, he would be eating chicken nuggets.
""Andrey Arshavin was the worst trainer, always laboured, very relaxed. He was terrible in training but very good on the day of the game.""

Mauricio Pochettino praised his team after Tottenham Hotspur defeated Chelsea at Stamford Bridge for the first time in 28 years. (0:30)
Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris says criticism of Dele Alli is unfair and has compared the midfielder to his France teammate Paul Pogba.
Alli scored a brace in Spurs' 3-1 win at Chelsea on Sunday, helping to dampen talk that he has been below par this season.
Pogba has also found himself out of favour this term and Lloris says both need time to mature.
""It is not easy for [Alli and Pogba] because you need to give time to them to get to the right age, to be mature,"" Lloris is quoted as saying by the I newspaper.
""But I think [Alli] has done so well for us, [the criticism] is a bit unfair. To see or to hear criticism, he is so talented -- there is a lot of expectation and obviously in football today it is normal that things like that happen. But he stays calm and stays good in his mind.""
Alli's two second-half goals at Stamford Bridge earned Spurs a first win at Chelsea since 1990 and moved them eight points clear of their fifth-placed rivals with seven league matches remaining.
""He is human,"" Lloris added. ""You can always have some doubt in a difficult time but I don't think it is a difficult time for him. He didn't play [for England] and he came back to training with a big willingness to show his quality and I think he is ready to finish this season strong.""
Spurs can now begin to prepare for Champions League football for a third consecutive season, while they face Pogba and United in the FA Cup semifinal on April 21.
Lloris believes Champions League qualification would be another significant step for the club and claimed ""something big"" is around the corner for Spurs.
""[The Premier League] is the most competitive league in the world and there are a lot of great teams and we've reduced the gap to them and that is the main thing,"" Lloris said.
""Tottenham has to stay at this level at least. With the new stadium, something big is waiting for us and we cannot see this future without the Champions League.""

Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini says he would like to swap shirts with Barcelona forward Luis Suarez if they come up against each other again.
Suarez bit Chiellini on the shoulder during a group game between Uruguay and Italy at the 2014 World Cup, resulting in a four-month ban from the game. The former Liverpool player missed the start of the 2014-15 La Liga season after signing for Barcelona that summer, and did not return to international football for almost two years.
The pair have since met in Champions League action for their clubs, and Chiellini told El Mundo that he disagreed with the severity of the punishment given to Suarez.
""I have met him since on the pitch and it was a pleasure, as he is a great forward and it always means a challenge,"" Chiellini said. ""I would like to swap jerseys with him. His punishment was a pity, not being able to enter the stadiums was over the top. It was just to give an example because of the World Cup.""
Chiellini has won the last six Italian league titles with Juventus, with the Turin side clear at the top of Serie A this season. He feels that the domination of clubs like Juve in their domestic leagues means there will eventually be a breakaway competition.
""We are heading towards a European Super League,"" he said. ""It will take 10, 20, 30 years, but it will come. With respect to the smaller teams, the Juve fans want to see Madrid, [Manchester] United, Barca, PSG... Imagine a Sunday with a Juve-Madrid, a City-Barca and an Atletico-Liverpool? Bufffffff!
""You would have to harmonise it with the local leagues, of course, but it would be the biggest spectacle in the world, bigger than the Super Bowl, because there is no mass phenomenon like football.""
Juve have reached two of the last three Champions League finals, but were beaten by Barca in 2015 and Madrid last year. Chiellini said the La Liga giants are the favourites again this season, with Manchester City and Bayern Munich also in the running.
""We feel convinced we can do it, but you cannot deny that this has been the moment of the Spanish teams in the tournament,"" he said. ""City and Bayern are going well, the former in a more difficult league where there are always four or five challengers for the title.
""But Real and Barca have something extra. They have both evolved in recent years, but they remain at the peak, and not just for Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Leo] Messi. [Pep] Guardiola's Barca, for example, were intense in attack, and reacted immediately when they lost the ball. Now they are different, more solid, but they beat you just the same.""

The architect behind plans for Everton's new dockside stadium has revealed that he hopes to include a home end inspired by the Yellow Wall at Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund.
The Liverpool Echo reported that Dan Meis, speaking at a forum with Everton fans, said he wanted to create a similar focal point to that at BVB's Westfalenstadion.
Everton's new stadium will be built at Bramley-Moore Dock, replacing their current Goodison Park home.
""We're planning on creating a very large home end in the south stand of the stadium which should be similar to Dortmund's Yellow Wall, Meis said.
""Depending on the final stadium capacity, the stand will hold 12,000-15,000 fans and we also want to include a concourse that will look back at the city, immediately by the home end -- that would be very cool.""
The architect has said he aims to design the ""greatest home ground in English football"" and is consulting with supporters as the plans are drawn up.
He has also said that some elements of Goodison, including vintage seating, could be incorporated into the new ground.

The ESPN FC guys look ahead to the Champions League quarterfinal first leg between Liverpool and Manchester City. (2:26)
LIVERPOOL -- Jurgen Klopp has challenged his Liverpool players to create their own history ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal with Manchester City.
Liverpool are in the last eight of the Europe's premier club competition for the first time since 2009 as they look to end their six-year trophy drought.
The club are five-time winners of the European Cup, but Klopp wants his side to embrace the past and use it to propel success in the immediate future.
""This club is already so full of history and we have to write our own history,"" he told a news conference on Tuesday.
""Everybody knows pretty much everything. I meet people over the world, they can tell me each goal Liverpool scored 37 years ago in the 56th minute. I think there are 10 players that did that and they can say the names. That's all good and I like that.
""This team, we need to be proud of our history, but we need to create our own history. I did that a lot in the past with my former teams. At one point you need to do your own things. The boys are ready, they are really looking forward to it -- you could see it immediately in the last game, after the draw. We are ready for that, but at the end, it stays difficult.""
Liverpool head into Wednesday's tie knowing they are the only team to have inflicted a league defeat on Pep Guardiola's side all season following the thrilling 4-3 result at Anfield on Jan. 14.
""I wouldn't name them weaknesses, but they [City] are not perfect because that's not possible,"" Klopp said. ""But that's not the moment to speak about weaknesses. It's only about giving information and showing respect -- that's what we do.
""You cannot win the game here, but we could lose it maybe here in the press conference, maybe, talking only bulls---. I'm happy when it's over and I can go back to my team.""
City can clinch the Premier League title on Saturday when they host rivals Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium.
Klopp is fully aware of the difficult task that Liverpool must overcome to reach the semifinals, although he went on to stress how he relishes the opportunity to take down opponents at the top of the game.
""It's just a big job to do. That's how it is,"" he continued. ""We wanted to go in this competition as far as possible and it was clear at one point that you will face the best teams in the world.
""They are quite a special team and they will be absolutely deserved champions of the Premier League. I'm absolutely fine with that. In football it's not about being the best or something like this, it's about being perfectly prepared for the next game and to do your best.
""It's not about yesterday, it's about tomorrow. It's about the moment. It's clear City with the things they have and what they've reached already this season that confidence is probably on an outstandingly high level. That's OK, but we are not in a bad moment. We are in a good moment.
""Would it right to sit here and say: 'City at Anfield, they have no chance'? That's not true. They have a chance because they can win wherever they go. But we can win football games as well and that's the only thing I'm interested [in].
""I like difficult tasks, I like the difficult jobs because they're the most interesting. For a manager, they're the most interesting. Let's go.
""The worst thing that can happen is that you can lose a football game. There are more difficult things to get than that. It's a big opportunity and we [will] try everything to make it happen.""

Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis has fined his players €400,000 and ordered some of them to go on holiday until the end of the season after a draw left the defending Greek Superleague champions third in the table.
Marinakis, who also owns Nottingham Forest, said he will call up players from the club's under-20 squad for the final four games following the 1-1 draw against Levadiakos on Saturday.
""I will build Olympiakos from the beginning and it will become the team we are dreaming of,"" Marinakis  told the players, according to AFP. ""I and the rest of the fans have tolerated you enough. You will leave today and go on holiday.""
Olympiakos, who have won the last seven league titles, have not been defeated in their last six games but they trail leaders AEK Athens by three points.
Marinakis told the players the €400,000 fine was for Saturday's draw and for the 1-1 draw against Panathinaikos on March 3 in which their rivals equalised on an 87th-minute penalty.
""The amateur teams live with the basics,"" Marinakis said. ""They love Olympiakos and their supporters much more than you do. [You think about] the nice houses you live in and your cars and don't care about the team.
""I pay millions for you to have everything. With your actions, I fired three coaches, but at the end it looks like you were at fault.""

In the bottom of the 15th inning, Jeff Mathis smacks a single to center to score Nick Ahmed, giving the Diamondbacks an 8-7 win over the Dodgers in the longest game in the history of Chase Field. (0:51)
PHOENIX -- Kenley Jansen calls it a ""slow start"" to the season.
In two appearances, he has lost a game and blown a three-run lead. No one expects that from one of the game's most dominant closers.
Chris Owings hit a three-run homer off Jansen with two outs in the bottom of the ninth to force extra innings, and the Arizona Diamondbacks scored twice in the 15th to rally past the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-7 early Tuesday.
The first matchup between the teams since the NL-champion Dodgers swept their Division Series last October became the longest game in Chase Field history at 5 hours, 46 minutes.
""We're down to barely nothing,"" Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said, ""and these guys found a way to win the game. It's a special night.""
Or, more accurately, a special morning.
Chase Utley's RBI single shortly after midnight put the Dodgers up 7-6 in the 15th, but Nick Ahmed's run-scoring double tied it in the bottom of the inning and pinch-hitter Jeff Mathis, the last position player on the Arizona bench, singled home Ahmed with the winner.
Both teams used all their available relievers. Mathis was going to pitch if the game had remained tied.
Wilmer Font (0-1) threw four scoreless innings before giving up two runs in the 15th. Fernando Salas (1-1) went three innings to get the win.
Jansen blew one save in 42 opportunities in 2017, but this season has not started well. The Dodgers' closer gave up a home run to Joe Panik in a 1-0 loss to San Francisco in his first outing on Friday, then squandered a three-run lead in his second on Monday night.
""I definitely know I'm fighting with some stuff,"" he said, explaining that the timing of his delivery was a problem.
Both Jansen and manager Dave Roberts said the All-Star closer is healthy.
""I know that he's got pinpoint command, doesn't walk guys,"" Roberts said. ""And I know there were some close calls tonight that didn't go his way. But regardless, Kenley still has the ability to throw strikes when he needs to. Just the pitch to Owings, it was a cutter that was down and in his nitro zone.""
The pitch was recorded at 89 mph. Last season, Jansen averaged 93 mph on his cutter, which is the pitch he has mostly relied on.
""No, it's not mechanic,"" Jansen said. ""He just got me. Who cares? Who cares? It's one game.""
With the Dodgers up 6-3, Jansen got the first two batters to ground out but walked Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock, both on 3-2 counts, to bring up Owings, who hit the first pitch he saw into the left-field seats.
""That pitch was right where I was kind of looking,"" Owings said. ""Definitely got us back in the game. From there, the rest is history.""
According to ESPN Stats & Information, the Dodgers had entered Monday's game with a 364-0 record when entering the ninth inning with a three-run lead over the past eight seasons.
Owings became just the fourth player to hit a three-run homer or grand slam against Jansen, who was touched up a bit in the World Series last year, too. The right-hander gave up two homers, took a loss and blew one of his three save chances against the Houston Astros.
""Listen, those guys have bats,"" Jansen said. ""They compete, too. Nobody wants to get beat. Nobody wants to blow saves. Nobody wants to lose games, but the situation of the game, it happens. What can I do? I've just got to bounce back tomorrow and help the Dodgers win.""
Yasiel Puig made two fine defensive plays for the Dodgers in the 14th, catching Goldschmidt's drive at the right-field fence and then throwing out Ketel Marte trying to advance to second on a deep flyout by Pollock.
Yasmani Grandal reached base in his first five plate appearances for the Dodgers, including a two-run homer in the first inning, but bounced out to second with runners on first and third to end the 10th.
Logan Forsythe also homered for Los Angeles, a solo shot off Yoshihisa Hirano to break a 3-all tie in the sixth.
Marte became the seventh Diamondbacks player to triple twice in a regular-season game. He also did it in last year's wild-card victory over Colorado.

Former first base coach Rich Dauer throws out the first pitch at the Astros home opener after recovering from a coma in the offseason. (1:24)
Rich Dauer, the former first base coach for the Houston Astros, tossed out the ceremonial first pitch in Houston's home opener against the Baltimore Orioles.
Dauer's return to Minute Maid Park was an emotional one, as Dauer -- a coach for three seasons with Houston -- suffered a subdural hematoma last year and almost died.
Dauer, 65, was unaware he was bleeding in his brain after he slipped and fell the night before the Astros' World Series championship parade. He attended the parade before he left and went to the hospital, undergoing a three-hour surgery.
Dauer spent his entire 10-year major league career in Baltimore and won the 1983 World Series with the Orioles.

After sending out a tweet motivating himself to end a hitless start to the season, Dexter Fowler flares an RBI single in the Cardinals' win over the Brewers. (0:24)
Nothing like self-motivation on social media to get Dexter Fowler going at the plate.
The St. Louis Cardinals outfielder snapped a season-opening 0-for-13 slump with a third-inning single to center during Monday's 8-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
Before the game, Fowler wrote ""I will get a hit"" 13 times in a tweet.
I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit. I will get a hit.

There must have been a little something to it. After two walks and a groundout in his first three plate appearances Monday, Reddick broke an 0-for-8 slide with a single in the seventh inning of the Astros' 6-1 victory over the Orioles.
Ramirez, however, saw his 0-fer streak to start the season extend to 15 at-bats with an 0-for-3 night during a 6-0 win over the Angels.

Astros All-Star shortstop Carlos Correa left Monday night's 6-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles with discomfort in his left big toe, the team said.
Correa was replaced by J.D. Davis at the start of the third inning after lining out in his first at-bat.
Correa said after the game that he had precautionary tests done on the toe after fouling a ball off his left foot Sunday. There's no structural or bone damage, but it has a lot of pooled blood.
During Monday's game, he said he irritated the area and felt pain while fielding a ball in the second inning, leading to his removal. Manager AJ Hinch said he's considered day-to-day.
Correa is hitting .438 with a team-leading 5 RBIs.

Tyler Mahle strikes out seven Cubs and allows just one hit over six innings of work. (0:34)
CINCINNATI -- It's the kind of mark no offense wants to set, but nonetheless, after the Chicago Cubs struck out 11 times in a 1-0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Monday afternoon, the 2016 World Series winners have now whiffed the most times -- 58 -- of any NL team ever through its first five games.
""Contact,"" hitting coach Chili Davis said afterward with a half-smile. ""We'd like to see a lot of good contact. There's some guys, you're not just going to turn them into contact-type hitters. I don't want them to lose their aggressiveness at the plate. We have too good of hitters for me to panic at all.""
The Cubs have often said the strikeout is part of their DNA, but they've taken things to new heights early in the season. On Friday, they struck out 20 times in a 17-inning game against the Miami Marlins. Outfielder Ian Happ set a franchise mark by striking out multiple times in each of his first four games of the season. As you might expect so early in a year, there is no panic in the Cubs' clubhouse.
""There really isn't,"" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. ""We have a fun group. A good group. We're not going to ride the roller coaster as hard as everyone else outside.""
Davis added: ""I'm not stressing. We're five games into the season. We were hoping for a fast start. It can still happen.""
Rizzo's eighth-inning strikeout with the bases loaded was No. 57 by the Cubs, tying them for the most through five games in the NL with the 2009 Washington Nationals. Kyle Schwarber's ninth-inning whiff was the team's 58th.
""I've talked about it for how many years now?"" manager Joe Maddon asked rhetorically. ""We have struck out a lot. It has been exacerbated by the 17-inning game but we have struck out a lot. We have to do better. We have to move the baseball. We talked about it all camp. We talked about it the last two years. I believe that we will, but right now, we're not.""
And if you think the 17-inning affair skews the numbers, as Maddon referenced, then consider that the Cubs also helped extend that game by striking out so much. It's a cycle they've been trying to break, even going so far as firing their hitting coach of the past three years, John Mallee, after the team was second in scoring in the NL the past two seasons and at the top of the league in walks and on-base percentage. Plus, the Cubs won a World Series under Mallee.
Davis -- who was let go by the Red Sox after last season -- was supposed to tone down the swings-and-misses and increase success in situational hitting, but the Cubs are just 1-for-14 so far bringing a runner home from third base with less than two outs. That's by far the worst percentage in baseball for any team with five or more opportunities in that situation. Of course, Davis will need more time than one spring training and five games.
""Hopefully, no one is pressing but no one is at their peak performance,"" Davis said. ""We are the Chicago Cubs. Guys are going to raise their game against us. I expect my offense to rise to the occasion too.""
It's true. The Reds' Tyler Mahle pitched well and dynamic closer Raisel Iglesias was responsible for those final two strikeouts. But the bottom line is at some point this season the Cubs need to improve in those moments or switching coaches wasn't worth it, while bringing back the same position-player base might come into question.
At this point, it's simply way too early to know anything for sure. But then again, the Cubs have also not come close to facing the best on the mound the league has to offer after a series with the Marlins and one game with the Reds.
""I'm not going to make any excuses,"" Maddon said. ""We should have done better but we're going to do better.""

Detroit thinks it has an extra-innings win after Nicholas Castellanos appears to beat the throw home, but after review, the call is overturned and Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire is ejected for arguing. (0:40)
Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire said Monday that Major League Baseball has acknowledged that mistakes were made Friday when a replay review overturned a walk-off victory for Detroit over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday.
Major League Baseball, however, said later Monday that it stood behind the decision.
In the 10th inning, Detroit's Nicholas Castellanos was initially called safe at home on a single by JaCoby Jones, and the Tigers spilled onto the field to celebrate. The play was reviewed, however, with the Detroit players still waiting on the field on the ruling.
After Castellanos was called out to end the inning, Gardenhire argued until he was tossed in his first game as the Tigers' manager and for the 74th time in his career. The Pirates went on to win the game 13-10 in 13 innings.
Gardenhire told reporters the Tigers ""heard what we wanted to hear"" when general manager Al Avila spoke with MLB this weekend. He said MLB acknowledged that too much time was needed to reach a replay decision and that the video evidence wasn't definitive.
""The explanation was they didn't really have conclusive evidence that somebody tagged him,"" Gardenhire said, according to mlive.com. ""Yes, he might have got him. 'We think he got him' is not good enough. In this situation, it has to be definitive. It has to be, 'Yeah, I see him [tag] him.' It's not, 'Well, he looked like he touched his sleeve.' That can't happen. It's got to be conclusive. Obviously it didn't happen. There were mistakes made. That's fine. It won't bring anything back.""
MLB said in its statement, however, that the correct call was made.
""The nature of the exchange with the Tigers was that the replay officials made the correct call based on conclusive evidence,'' MLB said. ""The video clearly shows the catcher applying the tag on the upper right arm of the runner.''
Gardenhire told reporters that MLB tried to blame the Tigers for the amount of time needed for the replay review.
""One of the statements made to me was, the reason it took so long is because you guys were celebrating,"" he told reporters, according to the Detroit News. ""I said, 'You just called our guy safe. We're not going to celebrate a win?'
""As soon as you put on the headphones, we stopped and stood there. That's a B.S. explanation. That's straight B.S. That's what I told them.""

Down seven runs in the ninth inning, Orioles catcher Chance Sisco takes advantage of the Twins' infield shift by bunting to get on base. (0:16)
I know an 11-year-old who plays a game at school that he and his friends inaccurately call handball: two players, one wall and one big, red ball. One player hits the ball against the wall, and before it bounces twice, the next player must hit the ball to the wall, and so on. Fail to hit the ball to the wall and you're out. The next challenger in line then gets to play.
This 11-year-old's mom was worried because her son was getting into a lot of loud, drawn-out arguments while playing this game. Indeed, every time it was his turn, his opponent would say he had made an illegal hit, he would protest, all the kids waiting in line would agree the hit was illegal, he would refuse to leave the court and the argument would last until the bell rang. Another day of play.

With the Orioles trailing 7-0 to the Twins in the ninth inning Sunday, catcher Chance Sisco bunted against the shift in the ninth for a hit. Minnesota's players weren't pleased.
Winning isn't everything -- and that applies to nearly every MLB team this year. We define a successful season for each club based on, well, reality.
So let's talk about Minnesota Twins star Brian Dozier, who took Stupid Unwritten Rules to a new level this weekend. Dozier is, in his words, ""getting hammered"" for his complaint against the Baltimore Orioles, which he should be if you consider the point of ""unwritten rules"" to be enforcing a rational code of play that exists for the good of the sport. Dozier's claims, in that interpretation, do not stand up, not even a little bit.
But that's the wrong way to think about unwritten rules. Unwritten rules are a scam that players run on each other to trick their opponents into acting against their own self-interests. They are stupid, of course, but more than that, they're brilliant, on multiple levels, and they seem to work -- and ever since I realized this, I've been a lot less annoyed.
To recap: Orioles rookie Chance Sisco batted in the ninth inning on Sunday, with Baltimore trailing Minnesota by seven runs. The Twins shifted their infield against Sisco, he bunted against the shift, he got a hit and he found out a half-hour later that by trying hard at baseball in a seven-run game he had violated something sacrosanct.
""When they didn't hold our runner on [earlier in the blowout], they conceded to the fact they didn't want us to steal, so we didn't steal,"" Dozier explained. ""We could have very easily stolen and put up more runs, so therefore in return, you don't bunt. That's what everybody is missing in this whole thing.""
In other words: We weren't trying, so he shouldn't have tried.
Of course, Dozier's logic prima facie was bad: The Twins kept throwing breaking balls, they kept positioning their defenders in elaborate shifts and so on -- so they were still trying. Intuiting some fluid and ambiguous code about how much to try is a lot to ask of players who are merely attempting to play baseball well, for money, in front of a large audience. Complaining about this -- as other Twins did, as well -- is comically sensitive. So most will hammer Dozier.
But Dozier's goal isn't, I'd argue, to get Chance Sisco to respect the game. It's to get Sisco -- and other Twins opponents -- to go easy on the Twins. It's to get them to not try extra hard to come back when they're trailing by seven runs. It's to get them to not force Dozier and his teammates to run any harder than they have to. It's to get them to be afraid of offending, embarrassing or tricking the Twins. (Or, alternately, to get them to be afraid of offending, embarrassing or tricking veterans, such as Dozier, who use their clout and seniority to steer young players toward certain types of non-threatening behavior.) It's to weaken their opponents or to cause their opponents to weaken themselves -- more complicated than but otherwise consistent with every other baseball strategy.
Run down the unwritten rules that are most often enforced and almost all of them hit these themes: ""Don't bunt to break up a no-hitter because we want to throw a no-hitter."" Brilliant! ""Don't yell 'Ha!' right when we're about to catch a popup because that would startle us and we might drop it."" I'm sure it would! ""Don't bunt 10 times at our pitcher who has the yips because he'll probably mess up and you'll get on base. Don't pimp home runs, because it makes us feel lousy (and you feel pumped up). Don't quick pitch -- I'm not ready! Don't throw changeups in hitters' counts during a blowout because I'm trying to have a high batting average. Also, don't steal bases in a blowout, because then we have to keep trying to make sure you don't. And no hustle doubles in blowouts. Take it eaaaasy."" I've seen teams complain that the opposing pitcher was throwing too many breaking balls. I've seen teams complain the opposing hitters wouldn't swing enough. Lawyer ball.
There is one unwritten rule for which ballplayers admit that this is the game: The one about not hitting batters with pitches lest ye too be hit by pitches. ""I've got news for you. In this game, there are unwritten rules,"" Terry Collins once said. ""You hit my guy, I'm hitting your guy. They're not hitting my guy tonight."" Another way of saying ""not hitting my guy"" is ""not throwing inside as much."" Another way of saying it is ""not making me feel uncomfortable.""
It helps to consider the Mafia -- not the real Mafia, which I don't know much about, but the fictional TV Mafia we all understand. The TV Mafia is notably disdainful of written rules -- the laws of the state -- but strictly, violently defensive of unwritten rules. In particular:
• Don't rat
• Wives and children are off limits
Why, in a culture that ignores virtually every law and moral code, are these principles so strong? Not because they represent some deeper morality about the sanctity of innocent life or group loyalty or the value of hierarchy, but because these are where TV Mafia bosses are the most vulnerable. There's not an easy defense against an enemy who wants to hurt you by hurting your children or who knows your secrets and might use them against you. So TV bosses use peer pressure to construct an ethical code, and the most powerful weapons against their most exposed vulnerabilities get neutralized.
The Around the Horn crew explains why Chance Sisco's ninth-inning bunt was not a violation of baseball's unwritten rules.
The unwritten rules of baseball are not as, shall we say, high stakes, but they almost all fall under some version of this: Where we are exposed, we ask nicely that you don't take advantage. If you do, we will shame you. (Note that a lot of unwritten rules have to do with convincing the opponent not to hustle. Note also that most unwritten rules are policed by veterans, who are tired and don't want to get in a hustle-off with a bunch of youngsters.) They can't get away with it for everything, of course. They can't say ""home runs are snakes, no hitting homers."" That would expose the bad faith of these claims. For this to work, everybody has to believe that Brian Dozier is truly, genuinely upset by this lack of decorum, and his opponents have to be concerned he really means it. Which, after arguing long enough, he eventually might.
Here's why this is all so awesome: Screaming ""unwritten rules"" in bad faith is exactly the sort of annoying, but effective, try-hard behavior that unwritten rules purport to prohibit. It's taking advantage of the vague boundaries of the rulebook to claim a small edge, and it's pursuing victory even at the expense of honor and decorum. Dozier claimed to be annoyed by Sisco, but Sisco was just trying to win. Meanwhile, we're all annoyed by Dozier right now, but he doesn't care because he's just trying to win. In a 7-0 game, Chance Sisco bunted. That's hustle. But in a 7-0 game, Brian Dozier was running a long con. That's a lifestyle commitment. Everybody else is playing baseball, but he's playing baseball players.
Back to the 11-year-old playing handball: Upon further investigation, his mother and I discovered that he was not an anomaly. Almost every match between any two kids went the same way: two or three hits; a claim of something done illegally; an argument; the kids in line agreeing that it was illegal; and a loud, drawn-out fight. This negotiation over legal vs. illegal was the game. It wasn't about handball but about who could win the argument.
Calling ""illegal"" first was one skill. Defending yourself and refusing to give in was another. And, of course, standing in line and agreeing that it was illegal was a third, because everybody in line wanted you to lose so it would be their turn. This game doesn't sound like it's very fun to play, but it's the game those kids have chosen, and danged if they aren't playing to win. It does sound like a lot of fun to watch.
I think we all agree that Dozier and the Twins were acting like 11-year-olds. But my interpretation is that they're acting like 11-year-olds who are fully invested in winning their game and who are taking advantage of not just the rules but the unwritten rules to do it. There's a pure competitive brilliance to it. I respect that.
The other interpretation is that they're way too sensitive and snitty, like ... well, like children. I would never assume so little of a classy group like the Twins.

LOS ANGELES -- At some point, you just have to get over it. Many or maybe all of us have survived a ""threshold"" moment. In a literal life-or-death situation, it's called the quietus -- that moment when the living ceases to exist in this realm and moves on to whatever comes next.
Every team in every baseball postseason series goes through a moment of quietus, when the raised fist of an umpire tells everyone that the last out has been made. Game over. Series complete. It's one of the uniquely great things about a clockless sport like baseball, where the most optimistic among us can keep hope alive for our team, until we can't.Editor's PicksClayton Kershaw at 30: A decade of dominance as seen by the pitcher and those who know him bestThe Sandy Koufax of our time just turned the big 3-0 and has stayed a step ahead of major league hitters for 10 years.

The Sandy Koufax of our time just turned the big 3-0 and has stayed a step ahead of major league hitters for 10 years. How has the ace of a generation reached this level, and where will his Cooperstown-worthy career go next?
Joe Panik followed up his Opening Day game-winning solo shot with another in the Giants' win over the Dodgers on Friday -- the first player ever to homer for his team in back-to-back 1-0 victories.
For the first time, the Dodgers are selling a ticket package that includes the seat where Kirk GIbson's historic pinch-hit, game-ending homer in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series landed. Eight-year-old Little Leaguer Jake Henderson sat there Thursday.
""We've been in the process of turning the page,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said on Opening Day. ""A lot of good things happened last year. Now, as 2018 starts, I know our guys are really looking forward to this day.""
The quietus struck the 2017 Dodgers on the first night of November, when Corey Seager grounded out to kick off the Astros' celebratory melee at Dodger Stadium. That ended what had been a glorious seven-month quest for the Dodgers, marked by 104 regular-season wins and the club's first pennant since 1988.
The quest ended one step shy of Valhalla. Their pennant drought had ended, which we were reminded of again on Saturday when the Dodgers held a ring ceremony to commemorate their National League championship. But their title drought extended yet another year, reaching 29 seasons. An entire generation of Dodgers fans has grown up without knowing what it's like to win it all.
""In the industry, the media and the fans, until you start the new season there is going to be talk [of last year],"" Roberts said. ""That's just kind of the way it goes. Certainly it's in our minds. No doubt. It's always going to be in our minds. But I think our guys are doing a very good job of understanding that we can't change it and looking forward.""
This season marks the 30th since the Dodgers last won, and the 60th year since the franchise picked up and moved from Brooklyn to L.A. During their first three decades out west, the Dodgers won five World Series. If the Dodgers don't win it this season, their title drought will have extended to half the time the team has played in California.
If not for that result on Nov. 1, 2017, we wouldn't be having this conversation. To come so close seems like it would be paralyzing. When pitchers and catchers reported for spring training, everything rolled back to zero. For the Dodgers to get back to the same moment will take months of work, work that they all but completed last year.
How do you recover from a near miss at that level? How do you stop looking back, and return to the same levels of intensity and focus that marked last season?
""I almost think it would be harder to get back to the grind if we had won Game 7,"" said Dodgers general manager Farhan Zaidi. ""This organization is still so hungry to get over that hump. We obviously got as close as you can without getting there. I think the hunger and motivation is very much there.""
Teams recover, of course. The 2014 Royals lost a Game 7 with the tying run on third base when the World Series ended. They were so traumatized that they won the title the very next season. The 2016 Indians lost one of the most epic Game 7s ever, in extra innings, and like the Royals had the tying run on base when the Series ended. The Indians didn't win the title last year, but they did win 102 games.
""We have to be over it,"" first baseman Cody Bellinger said. ""It's a new season. Time to move on.""
You do it because you have to. The baseball world moves in one direction: forward.
""We're very much a glass-is-half-full organization,"" Zaidi said. ""We feel great about what we accomplished last year. But there was no panic [in our offseason]. We believe in our process and our talent.""
Here's a portrait of spring training with a team that was one win from a World Series title:
It's a lazy late-winter morning in Arizona and nothing much is happening. Dodgers camp has been dull. Most of the players in the clubhouse, the ones destined for the 40-man roster, were in the organization at the end of last season. The most notable new face is familiar -- outfielder Matt Kemp, a former Dodgers All-Star reacquired for reasons that had little to do with his remaining on-field ability.
The most dramatic thing that had happened in camp to that point had been an outbreak of illness that swept through the team's facility at Camelback Ranch. Players and staff were sent home early one day when that happened and the entire facility was decontaminated.
The lack of excitement is why this particular day carried with it a whiff of anticipation: Kenley Jansen and Corey Seager were playing. It was just a ""B"" game, but neither Dodgers cornerstone had been playing in games. Seager was being protected because of the elbow soreness that plagued him last season. Jansen had turned up with a tight hamstring. Their maladies were the closest thing to drama.
Spring training ""B"" games are amazing, played on a back field surrounded by chain-link fences, and the dugouts are contraptions that you'd expect to find at a small high school. The rules are lax -- Seager batted leadoff each inning to get in extra work. No one seems to keep score.
Seager had two fielding chances, both of which resulted in routine throws that he executed with no apparent difficulty. He also swatted a home run during his first at-bat, reminding everyone why we care so much about his elbow in the first place. He was fine and in his soft-spoken way, he fielded questions afterward.
""I wasn't really worried about [the elbow],"" Seager said. ""I was just more worried about getting into some games and into the flow of things.""
Oh wait: Here's some drama, if you look hard enough. That morning, Roberts was asked if he might give Seager some extra days off during the season.
""If there is a day after night game, or we're running him out there too much,"" Roberts said. ""We'll manage him week-to-week.""
Seager doesn't want days off. Or won't admit it, if he does. When asked whether he was on board with Roberts' plan, Seager said, ""No."" He paused as if to elaborate, not something he's prone to do. Then he said, again, ""No.""
That's about as much conflict as there was in Dodgers camp, with the possible exception being the team's clubhouse doubles pingpong tournament.
Meanwhile, back in the ""B"" game, after a few innings Jansen took a seat in the bullpen area. His wife watched the proceedings nearby while his young son entertained swooning fans by throwing a baseball, running to retrieve it, then throwing it again. Take note, scouts: He's a righty.
When Jansen walked out to the mound for his outing, it was a far cry from his usual ""California Love"" entrance at Dodger Stadium. He rolled through three batters, throwing mostly sliders instead of his signature cutter, and then walked off the field and picked up his son, holding him while he did a TV interview.
In the clubhouse, Jansen walked over to his locker with several reporters standing nearby. But there were no questions. It was spring, he's Kenley Jansen, he threw the ball like Kenley Jansen. Nothing happening at Camelback Ranch was going to fast-forward the Dodgers to October.
Two days later, Jansen was slated to make his official spring debut with an inning against the Royals. Roberts quipped to reporters that because Jansen's workload had been so limited -- by design and because of injury -- he had enjoyed a longer offseason than any of them.
Jansen spent much of the pregame session with a pitching wedge, trying to knock golf balls into a wood-and-netting contraption called ""The Chipper."" A couple of hours later, he walked out to the mound, hit 94 mph on the radar and tossed a perfect inning on 13 pitches.
""I feel great!"" Jansen pronounced afterward.
That's where the Dodgers are right now. The same core players are back. They've won the NL West five years in a row. Continuity like this can be a sign of stagnation, but that's not the vibe you get from the Dodgers. It's more like a sense of collective assurance.
At the same time, the story of the Dodgers' 2018 season can't be written until what seems like a sure-fire sixth straight trip to the postseason. Everything that happens from Camelback Ranch through the dog days of August will be mere prelude. The entire morning had been, for lack of a better term, boring.
When you're as good as the Dodgers, you can afford to be boring because you know how much excitement lies ahead.
Nothing in sports lasts forever. Elite athletes don't stay elite for long. Players get injured or age out of the game. Other teams rise up. There are no guarantees that L.A will get another opportunity in the Fall Classic with this group, even though the Dodgers are so well-positioned to get back there. Because the Cubs are, too, and so are the Nationals, and that's just the prime contenders.
In a different era of Dodgers baseball, this winter might have played out differently. To come so close to winning it all when you have the resources -- both in terms of cash and prospect depth -- that the Dodgers have, you might be inclined to do something rash.
That is not how the team operates. Star power combined with elite depth characterizes these Dodgers. They spend richly but rationally, while keeping the minor league pipeline full. It's the glitz of Los Angeles combined with the discipline of a small-market club, the latter a trait team president Andrew Friedman brought with him from his days in Tampa Bay.
""Part of our thought process was that we're a pretty deep team as it is,"" Zaidi said. ""Let's not force guys down the depth chart that we want to get opportunities for.""
So the Dodgers had a dull winter. Kemp was acquired in mid-December coming off a season in Atlanta in which he posted minus-1.3 WAR in 115 games while battling lower-body injuries. L.A.'s rationale for the trade was this: By taking on the final two years of Kemp's contract and moving the 2018 money that would have gone to the quartet of players sent to the Braves, the Dodgers would be able to stay under the luxury tax threshold. That reset repeater penalties, which has un-glamorous benefits in things like tax payouts and amateur player acquisition.
The trade makes it easier for the Dodgers to be players in the next free-agent class. That may mean nothing more than re-signing Clayton Kershaw, who can opt out of his current deal after the season. Or it could mean a run at Bryce Harper or Manny Machado. It's good to have flexibility.
But first there's the 2018 season and that missing last step from last season. When you come so close and haven't won for so long, can such a passive approach be justified?
""We didn't really have any clear needs,"" Zaidi said. ""That was something we said in our first press conference after the season. For the most part we weren't going out there to fill a particular position. Like every team, we're going to look for chances to get better, but we didn't have a shopping list, is the way I'd put it.""
If you don't like that answer, you weren't really paying attention to how the Dodgers got to the World Series last season. Unwanted veterans like Brandon Morrow and Chris Taylor didn't stir any hearts when the Dodgers took interest. But both were key components of the historically strong regular season and the postseason run.
Morrow defected to the Cubs via free agency, but Taylor is now the everyday center fielder. No one around the team seems to marvel at that, even though it's something no one would have predicted a year ago. Taylor, a man of few words, is so embedded at this point that his manager rarely even speaks to him.
""We have that kind of relationship,"" Roberts joked. ""We have a great relationship.""2018 MLB Season PreviewWill anyone catch the Astros? Can the Dodgers return to the World Series? A new MLB season is here. Preview »

Will anyone catch the Astros? Can the Dodgers return to the World Series? A new MLB season is here. Preview »
Taylor's ascension is more than the story of a player finding himself mid-career. It reflects a key trait about the way the Dodgers operate. It's not just about financial resources. It's not just about paying equal attention to the traditional areas of scouting and minor league development. It's also about finding diamonds in the rough and having a coaching staff that helps second-chance veterans become better versions of themselves.
""Part of having depth is also creating opportunity,"" Zaidi said. ""We can talk about depth, but no player wants to view themselves as depth. Every player believes in his ability to be a big leaguer and believes he has a chance to impact the team, given that chance.
""We want our players to believe that opportunity is real. We want to be able to point to guys as examples of players who might have been generically referred to as depth at one point but wound up being a lot more than that.""
One of those players this year could be reliever J.T. Chargois, plucked off waivers during spring training from the Twins. A fireballing righty, Chargois' professional career to this point has been one of injuries and disappointment -- he missed two full years in the minors because of elbow problems. On Opening Day, with the Dodgers trailing the Giants 1-0, Chargois became the first reliever called upon by Roberts during the 2018 season, coming on for Kershaw. He mowed down three straight Giants, striking out Austin Jackson and Andrew McCutchen, and touched 96 mph on the gun.
""We sort of threw him in the fire,"" Roberts said. ""He executed pitches, so his stuff really plays. From what I've seen so far, there's a lot of emotion, but he's shown that he can channel it in the right way.""
It was just one game, but it's not hard to envision Chargois becoming this year's version of Morrow.
""Everyone is trying to become more efficient,"" Chargois said, having clearly already adapted to the official team lexicon. ""Whether it's a teammate or a coach trying to help out, we're always trying to get better. It's one thing I love about this team -- it's a great learning environment.""
As for this year's version of Taylor, how about Kemp? After he was acquired, it was widely assumed the Dodgers would either flip Kemp to another team or set him adrift. But Kemp relished returning to his old team, and just wanted a chance. And the team said it'd give him one.
""We were candid with Matt that we made the trade for financial reasons,"" Zaidi said. ""But he told us is that all he wanted was an opportunity. He loved being with the Dodgers before and he just wanted a chance to earn a spot on the team and earn playing time. So far both sides have kept up their side of the bargain. We've been open-minded about him and he's been terrific on and off the field.""
Kemp showed up to camp in -- you know the words -- the best shape of his life. Except he really did, arriving in Arizona noticeably leaner. He moved better and put up good spring numbers. Lo and behold, Kemp started in left field on Opening Day, drawing a tremendous cheer from the home fans during introductions.
Like all the Dodgers, with the possible exception of Kershaw, Kemp is now just one of the guys, not the MVP-caliber star he was in his first L.A. stint. He's older, wiser and perhaps a little more appreciative of what it means to don Dodger blue.
""I was excited when I got traded here in the offseason,"" Kemp said. ""It was crazy. I had to work hard in the offseason and work to show them exactly the type of player I'm capable of being. I'm just happy to be back. It's really exciting.""
Part of last year's story, too, was rookies. Bellinger clubbed 39 homers, finished fifth on the team in WAR and followed Seager as the Dodgers' second straight NL Rookie of the Year. There might not be that kind of impact from a rookie this season, but if needed, it's not hard to envision righty Walker Buehler or outfielder Alex Verdugo breaking through in a similar way.
It's all part of L.A.'s no-stone-left-unturned approach, overseen behind closed doors and innumerable computer screens by an expansive front office staff. Yes, it's a little boring. But it works.
You might have viewed the Dodgers' season-opening festivities as an in-your-face reminder of how long it has been since their 1988 title. You can't blame the team. We all love to celebrate round-numbered anniversaries, and that L.A. team was awfully memorable. Who hasn't seen Kirk Gibson's homer off Dennis Eckersley replayed a million times? We all remember Vin Scully's unforgettable epilogue: ""In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened.""
Gibson was there to throw out the first pitch, one day after he autographed the seat where that famous home run landed. That seat is now covered in blue and beginning this year is called ""The Kirk Gibson Seat."" The story of Gibson's homer was told in a short documentary on the scoreboard, then he came out of the dugout carrying the same bat and took a couple of swings from the on-deck circle. Orel Hershiser, his Cy Young-winning teammate on that '88 team, and Tommy Lasorda, his manager, took part in the ceremony.
The Dodgers lost their opener to the hated Giants 1-0, the franchise's first 1-0 loss in an opener since 1930. Joe Panik curled a homer around the right-field foul pole off Kershaw for the game's only run. No one was too worked up about it, of course. What is one game for a team that has achieved everything together? Well, almost everything.
Then it happened again in the second game -- a 1-0 Giants win. Once again, a Panik homer accounted for the lone tally. This time it came off Jansen, whose velocity was down a few ticks. The second loss came on Kirk Gibson Bobblehead night.
If the Dodgers needed a wake-up call, they had it. Two games. Zero runs. Logan Forsythe, moved to the hot corner because of an injury to Justin Turner, was hitless in both games and committed three errors in the second one.
Just like that, if you're a pessimistic Dodgers fan who thought the team should have been more aggressive over the winter, you see ominous portents everywhere. Jansen's velocity. Turner's busted hand. The viral outbreak at Camelback Ranch. The sewage flood at Dodger Stadium earlier in the week during an exhibition against the Angels. There is even the name of the Giants' early-season hero: Panik.
Freaking out is obviously pointless. That's doesn't mean there isn't a lesson here. The lesson is that no two baseball seasons are alike. If the Dodgers get back to the World Series, they'll have carved out a different path than the one they took last season, even as they rely on so many of the same faces.
""Players will tell you that they are at their best when they are comfortable and they know their roles,"" Zaidi said. ""Speaking for myself, in my 14th year in baseball, I value continuity a lot more. Whenever we're thinking about a transaction, I always ask myself, 'Is the upside worth the potential disruption?' It used to be just, 'Does this make us better on paper?'""
Continuity isn't a frequent topic in baseball analysis, and it's hard to think of an objective way to measure its effect. That's different from saying it doesn't matter. Roberts had a friend come in during spring training to address the team about that very topic -- continuity, connection -- though he stopped short of calling it a motivational speech. Still, Roberts is a believer in continuity.
""[Continuity] builds up trust,"" Roberts said. ""You start to learn what guys can and can't do. In spring training, I can trust that the players and coaches know what they have to do to get ready for a major league season. And in the day-to-day practices of the regular season, guys know the strengths and weaknesses of the other teams. The continuity that we've had here the last couple of years is really instrumental.""
Another thing that characterizes the Dodgers is the unique makeup of the clubhouse. From the irrepressible Yasiel Puig from Cuba, to so-everyman-he's-kind-of-fascinating Midwesterner Rich Hill, the Dodgers have personalities of all types and from all corners of the globe. Eight different nations are represented in the L.A. clubhouse, the most in baseball.
That all-corners approach seems appropriate for an organization so thorough in its processes, though the Dodgers have long been one of baseball's most diverse teams. It makes for an interesting mix of clubhouse personalities that despite their differing backgrounds seem to mesh just fine.
""It's pretty seamless,"" Roberts said. ""It's funny hearing what people think is normal and how they adjust. For me, to get an outside view of how these guys interact with one another, it's a lot of fun.""
Looking around that clubhouse, you couldn't help but notice how similar it looked after the game on Nov. 1, when the atmosphere was a little more somber. Chargois wasn't there, nor was reliever Scott Alexander. Kemp watched the World Series on television, with what he has admitted was a bit of jealousy.
""That's one of the advantages of being in a market like ours and having the resources we do,"" Zaidi said. ""When you have a team that succeeds on the field, it's easier to keep that team together. In 2017 and with this team, that's been a little bit of a theme.""
In other words, those Dodgers are pretty much these Dodgers. They didn't trade for Giancarlo Stanton or re-sign Yu Darvish. Don't mistake that for a concession. Simply put, the Dodgers are good enough to be boring. According to baseball-reference.com, last year's Dodgers had 49.5 WAR as a team. Players accounting for 48.4 of that WAR are back. The stars are back but so is the depth. If you're tired of seeing the Dodgers in the playoffs, 2018 likely won't be your year, either.
""[Possible transactions] have got to clear the internal bar,"" Zaidi said. ""We like the guys we have. It's good for the group of guys we have here to feel like [positional] competitions are being kept in-house as opposed to introducing different variables into the equation.""
That's a very Dodgers way of putting it and, really, why would L.A. have shaken things up? This group has been knocking on the door together. It's fitting they get another chance to stare down their annual quietus and, instead of succumbing to it, take that last step through to the other side.
For the Dodgers, the time is now. Thirty years is a long time to be living in the past.

For the first time since the middle of George W. Bush’s presidency, MLB team spending on player salaries will decline, according to numbers compiled by Paul Hembekides, a researcher for ESPN Stats & Information.
That’s 14 consecutive years of pretty steady growth, followed by decline. The players’ share of the pie continues to get smaller, and for the owners, even larger.
There are plenty of signs that the winter of 2017-18 was the first wave in a troubling trend, from the explosion in the number of free agents -- the volume works against the players as a function of supply and demand -- to the recent rash of signings of young players who agree to forgo free agency for a year or two or three. The players are aware of all of this, of course, and spring training camps were filled with conversations about what should come next for the union. When Tony Clark met with teams, some players asked the executive director very hard questions. The frustration and anger over the financial shift is raw and deep.
But to date, the union’s collective response has been surprisingly slow, and probably for the obvious reason: In an industry in which careers average only a few years at the big league level, the players are mostly focused on their work. On pitching, on hitting, on the increased preparation required for games scheduled almost daily for six months.
This is why Clark needs to drive the changes that are needed, as soon as possible. In some presidential administrations, cabinet secretaries will provide letters of resignation that can be used when needed, so when the president sees a need for change, he can execute it quickly.
Given the current context, a letter of resignation from Clark would push the players’ executive committee into needed action. This wouldn’t necessarily mean that the letter would be accepted or that Clark’s role or title would even change. But it would give the players an immediate opportunity to reassess, to restructure, to strengthen their side.
And with that proffer of resignation, Clark should recommend that the players create an advisory board -- a legal brain trust -- that could evaluate the union’s position and challenges, and offer suggestions. The counsel of Don Fehr and Gene Orza could be gleaned in this way. Virginia Seitz, who has successfully argued cases on behalf of the players' association in the past, would be another name to consider.
As it stands, some players have talked about waiting until the executive-board meeting in the forthcoming offseason to give Clark more time for change on his own. Clark is well-liked and well-respected as a person, and some players respect how much he cares for them. But the players should not wait to start the engine of change.
“Each day that passes jeopardizes the next market,” one agent said, “and limits [the group] that is going to lead. Each day that passes is a lost day.”
A big-picture strategy is needed as soon as possible to combat the effects of the recent spending trends: the front-office aversion to investing in free agents over 30 years old; the increased specialization of roles, which limits the earning power of pitchers and position players being rested more often; the enormous classes of free agents.
But the union cannot adequately prioritize issues and create the desperately needed vision until it determines what form the leadership will take, whether Clark leads a revamped legal team or he works in concert with an all-star team of union lawyers or new lawyers take control.
There was talk among some players in spring training about preparing for labor war when the current collective bargaining agreement expires in a few years. That can be helpful only if those conversations serve to educate a generation of players who haven’t been through a work stoppage.
But there are a whole lot of steps that could be taken before the summer of 2021. None of them can really be explored until the players create the leadership they want and need. Once that happens, the players' association can purposefully engage Major League Baseball on the issues that folks on both sides see as problematic -- for example, the increased number of teams that tank seasons and don’t spend. Those conversations will take time -- for idea exchange, for bargaining, for identifying common ground and solutions.
Clark would help the players he really cares about by leading them to the changes the union needs.
• Inevitably, there will be more spending on free agents next winter than this winter, because the class might include Manny Machado, Bryce Harper, Clayton Kershaw and Josh Donaldson. “Beyond that, it is going to be a disaster -- again,” an agent predicted.
From Hembekides: Teams committed almost a billion dollars less in major league free-agent contracts this offseason than each of the previous two, dropping to $1.47 billion from $2.41 billion in 2016-17 and $2.53 billion in 2015-16. As a result, it's obviously safe to speculate if payroll growth will ever gain the momentum it did for much of the past 15 years.
As Giants players shook hands Friday night, Joe Panik worked to suppress a grin. In each of San Francisco’s first two games of the season, a solo home run by Panik represented the only scoring in the game -- the first time the Giants had won consecutive 1-0 decisions on the road since 1908. And this comes at a time when San Francisco is without Madison Bumgarner (out until late May or early June), Jeff Samardzija (expected back sometime in April) and closer Mark Melancon (out indefinitely) -- and when the Giants' schedule is loaded with early games against the Dodgers. Ten of San Francisco’s first 28 games are against Los Angeles, and they need early-season heroes such as Panik.
Some other interesting schedule quirks from early this season:

Will anyone catch the Astros? Can the Dodgers return to the World Series? A new MLB season is here. Preview »
• The Marlins could get buried quickly: Miami’s new ownership made the decision to slash payroll and trade just about any expensive player it could, to reposition the team. So the Marlins will be likely be terrible by design, and on top of that, their April schedule is packed with games against high-end teams out of their division: four against the Cubs, then two against the Red Sox, two at Yankee Stadium on April 16-17, four in Milwaukee, then three at Dodger Stadium. If those games play out as expected, it could be that by May 1, the Marlins should prepare in earnest for the No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft.
• The Nationals could have a pillow-soft schedule in the second half: Washington and the Marlins play only three games before July 5, leaving a whole lot of second-half cupcakes on the table. Twelve of the Nationals’ final 60 games are against the Marlins.
• The Dodgers have a fair bit of travel down the stretch: Sometimes, the West Coast teams can mostly stay in the Pacific time zone in the last weeks, but over the final five weeks of the regular season, the Dodgers will have trips to Texas, Colorado, Cincinnati and St. Louis.
• The Astros will get a lot of their tougher out-of-division games out of the way early: By June 4, Houston will have played home-and-home sets against the Yankees and Indians, as well as a four-game set against the Red Sox. Eighteen of Houston’s first 61 games are against the Indians, Yankees and Red Sox.
• The Cubs have a chance to break out strongly: Chicago will see a lot of the National League's weakest teams early, including 13 games against the Marlins and Braves by May 17.
• The Red Sox will have a chance to feast on the Rays: The Tampa Bay-Boston rivalry has always been underrated in its intensity -- remember Gerald Williams charging Pedro Martinez, one of many brawls between the teams? But the Red Sox are loaded now, and the Rays are restructuring. Boston will play most of its 2018 games against Tampa Bay by May 24 -- 13 of 19 matchups. And then the Red Sox won’t see the Rays again until Aug. 17 and not once in September.
Kershaw threw inside at a higher rate than any pitcher in baseball in 2017, in keeping with a career-long habit of bullying hitters. But on Opening Day, his average fastball was down to a career-low 90.7 mph, and he attacked the outer half of the strike zone in his final few innings, often with off-speed pitches, and kept the Giants’ hitters off-balance, allowing one run in six innings. Some evaluators believe Kershaw would benefit from making the same transition CC Sabathia has made during his career; by consistently using both sides of the plate, he can be less predictable and more difficult for hitters to diagnose.
From ESPN Stats & Information research, no pitcher threw inside at a higher rate last season than Kershaw. He threw 40.2 percent of his pitches inside, a full 3 percent higher than any other player.
Another interesting note about Kershaw’s pitch locations: He threw 70.1 percent of his pitches in the lower half of the strike zone last season, more than 10 percent higher than he has thrown in any other season in the past 10.
• Because Hal Steinbrenner’s Yankees opened this season ranked just seventh among teams in payroll, they are well-positioned to make significant midseason deals, if needed. Last year, the Yankees wanted Justin Verlander but had to let him pass by on waivers because they didn’t have the payroll flexibility to spend. This year, they will likely be among the most aggressive teams, particularly in the August waiver period, with a chance to make an already good club even better.
• The Dodgers appear to have found a great bullpen piece in right-hander J.T. Chargois, who was placed on waivers by the Twins in late February. He was thrilled and surprised that L.A. made the claim, and followed the Dodgers' suggestion that he move from the third-base side of the pitching rubber to the first-base side, a shift designed to improve his angle and command. Chargois got strong results in spring training and in his first appearance of the regular season.

MIAMI -- Unfair as it is to question a pitcher after only one start, critics of Chicago Cubs righty Yu Darvish will point to his World Series performance -- combined with his season debut for his new team on Saturday -- and declare he wasn't worth the $126 million the team will pay him over the next six years.
Darvish wasn't able to complete five innings against the lowly Miami Marlins on a night when the Cubs desperately needed innings out of him after losing a 17-inning affair the night before. Instead, according to ESPN Stats & Information, Darvish threw at least 100 pitches without finishing five innings for only the second time in his career.
""A lot of pitches for 4.1 innings,"" manager Joe Maddon said after the Cubs' 10-6 win in 10 innings. ""Overall, he just didn't have his best stuff tonight.""
Darvish gave up five runs and five hits, two walks and two hit batters. The best strikeout pitcher per nine innings in baseball history didn't whiff a Marlin until the pitcher came to bat in the third inning. The problem was simple: He had no command of his fastball.
""It seems like every time I pitched the first game in Japan things went not so well,"" Darvish said through his interpreter. ""I don't know why that happened. ... It could have been a location problem with my pitches. I don't think I was able to command whatever I wanted to, in terms of fastball.""
Darvish indicated it was the same in Texas, where he compiled a 3.65 ERA in his first starts of a season, slightly higher than his career mark. He also had great stuff in his warm-up in the bullpen Saturday, according to those that saw it.
So maybe he had some first-game jitters once he took the mound, which isn't unheard of -- even for elite arms in the game. But combined with his World Series performance last fall, he has now given up 13 runs in his past 7&frac23; innings pitched. Just as it might be unfair to judge a pitcher after one game, it's just as unfair to judge him with five months in between.
It won't matter to some. Darvish is going to have to shed the reputation of an underachiever. It's not that he has had a bad career -- it's that his stuff screams he should be better.
None of that mattered Saturday because Darvish had nowhere near his best stuff. To wit: Miami hitters were 3-for-9 in at-bats that ended on his fastball while he generated only one swing-and-miss out of 22 swings on that pitch. That tied for the fewest swings-and-misses on his fastball since the beginning of last season, while the 4.5 percent miss rate was the second lowest for him over the past two seasons. Bottom line: His fastball was a mess.

Will anyone catch the Astros? Can the Dodgers return to the World Series? A new MLB season is here. Preview »
""They made me throw more pitches than I expected, so the rhythm got inconsistent there,"" Darvish said.
This is a Marlins team not exactly full of fully developed major league hitters, so it's hard to see the opponent as the big obstacle.
""Was probably too anxious to have a great debut,"" catcher Willson Contreras said. ""He missed a lot of spots with his fastball, even with a slider too. He didn't have it today. He didn't get them to chase a lot. That's something we need from him.""
And it came on a night the Cubs needed it. Not the same way the Dodgers needed him last fall, of course, but nonetheless he wasn't able to eat the innings that were needed.
""Nothing was absolutely right today,"" Maddon said.
A ball hit off Darvish's right leg in his final inning didn't help matters, though he stayed in the game and said he was fine. That was followed by a possible cramp in his arm that ""went away"" quickly.
Fair or unfair, the jury will be out on Darvish until he proves he can be a consistent, dominant pitcher for his new team -- and earn that big paycheck.
""He's going to have a great year,"" Contreras said. ""The first one wasn't as good as he is.""

Six months after a terrifying scene, Major League Baseball's parks have extended the netting to protect more fans than before.
It was the fifth inning of an afternoon game in the Bronx between the Twins and the Yankees last Sept. 20. A toddler, soon to turn 2, was sitting on her grandfather's lap behind the third-base dugout. Then-Yankee Todd Frazier ripped a 105 mph line drive that struck her in the head.
The girl's father, Geoff Jacobson, told ESPN.com that her six days in intensive care were the longest in the lives of the Jacobson family. He said his daughter had skull fractures, bleeding on the brain, both eyes swollen shut and the impression of the baseball's stitching on her forehead. She had a feeding tube and was hooked up to machines monitoring her for seizures.
In the moments after his foul ball hit her, Frazier and both teams were silent -- some players were crying. Play was stopped for more than five minutes as emergency personnel tended to the girl.
The accident and the aftermath became national news.
""I'm in my family room and my son says, 'Turn on the TV,'"" said Jay Loos, who was hit by a foul liner past first base at Wrigley Field less than a month before. Loos was permanently blinded in one eye and suffered broken facial bones in the accident.
""I said, 'Oh my god' and had tears running down my good eye.""
Loos, who has now had three eye operations, said that when he was in the hospital, he was consumed with fear that it would happen to someone else.
When it happened to Jacobson's daughter, it immediately intensified the scrutiny and the pressure to extend safety netting at all ballparks.
""That was the tipping point -- unfortunately, it took that,"" said Rick Cusick, who also lost sight in one eye after a foul liner struck him in 2016 at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.
Two months before the injuries to Jacobson's daughter, the Yankees said they were ""seriously exploring"" extending protective netting after a series of events, including:
New York City council member Rafael Espinal proposed a law mandating netting from behind home plate to both foul poles
The Mets extended their netting beyond the far ends of both dugouts
An Aaron Judge foul line drive bloodied a man at Yankee Stadium
During the 11 days between the Frazier liner and the season's end, there were a flurry of safety-related announcements from teams. Several, including the Yankees, said they would extend protective netting at their ballparks.
""The public outcry was so galvanizing, and teams snapped into place,"" said Andy Zlotnick, a vocal advocate for increased protection since he endured multiple fractures and surgeries, as well as retinal damage, after he was hit in the face by a liner at Yankee Stadium in 2011. ""Her [Jacobson's daughter's] injury was what many of us warned about for years.""
In January, the Yankees released the new details: They would extend netting beyond the far edges of both dugouts for 2018.
On Feb. 1, Major League Baseball said all 30 teams would now have netting extending to at least the far edges of both dugouts -- triple the number that had it for 2017.
""The injury to my daughter, I guess, was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" Jacobson said.
""Sadly, it often takes great tragedy and suffering to cause change. I think, without question, these actions of extending the netting will help countless people never having to endure what my daughter went through, and all the people injured before her,"" Jacobson added.
A league official familiar with the issue said on condition of anonymity that MLB knew last summer of several teams that were already planning to extend netting for 2018 and it is unclear whether the Sept. 20 accident in New York influenced other teams to do so.
""I think they did the right thing, which is commendable,"" Jacobson said. ""There was nothing they could do to undo the past, but there is no better time than the present to make a better future.""
Said Cusick: ""The question is whether that [the 2018 changes] will be enough. All we want is for nobody to get hurt again.""
Four years ago, a Bloomberg News report estimated 1,750 fans a year are struck by foul balls or bats at MLB games.
""The injury to my daughter, I guess, was the straw that broke the camel's back.""
The official who declined to be named said the league has not logged or maintained data on foul balls entering the stands, or on how the extensions of netting the past two seasons have affected the numbers.
Jacobson, who has not made his daughter's first name public, said she might eventually require surgery on her nose and orbital bones and continues to wear an eye patch for five hours a day, as she has for the past three months, to improve her vision and strengthen the injured eye, but the extent of the damage to her optic nerve is not yet known.
""We are very fortunate in the grand scheme of things,"" he added. ""The truth is my daughter could have been killed, give or take an inch.""
There was once a fatality caused by a foul ball hit into the stands at a big league game. Alan Fish, 14, died after a liner struck him in the head at Dodger Stadium in 1970.
But for 45 years, there hadn't been a significant, league-wide push to extend netting beyond the area behind home plate. Then, on June 5, 2015, at Boston's Fenway Park, a shard from a broken bat slammed into a woman's head. Tonya Carpenter suffered life-threatening injuries and underwent emergency brain surgery.
Commissioner Rob Manfred had MLB begin a study.
A month later at Fenway, another woman, Stephanie Wapenski, needed 40 stitches to close facial wounds inflicted by a foul line drive.
In December 2015, as Manfred approached his first anniversary on the job, he publicly issued a recommendation that teams extend protection to at least the near edges of the dugouts. All 30 did so for the start of the 2016 season.
But there hasn't been a league mandate or uniformity on extended netting, say MLB and team officials, because of the varied configurations of the ballparks and the contention of some fans that netting detracts from experiences they enjoy in seats close to the field.
""Core fans who pay the top dollar for the best seats have been opposed to netting,"" said Dave St. Peter, president and CEO of the Minnesota Twins, who added that all teams covet good relationships with those fans.
But the Twins, a leader among teams in extending netting, were pushed early by owner Jim Pohlad to analyze the problem, St. Peter said. ""He was more than willing to take the risk of alienating some of the best fans. Most rewarding is that the fans most opposed decided to give it a try; they felt relaxed, and it didn't inhibit their enjoyment.""
Minnesota is extending netting it already had to the far ends of the dugouts last year at Target Field, which features seating that is especially close to the action. And the team, like others, is adopting a camouflage-like color for netting to better blend with the greens and browns of the fields.
St. Peter said that while ""it's hard to gauge and we don't have firm data [on the blocking effects of the Twins' netting so far], there's no question anecdotally that balls and even bats would've been in the stands.""
The Yankees, who declined to comment for this story, offered to pay Jacobson's daughter's medical expenses and have already done so for bills insurance didn't cover, Jacobson said. He expressed appreciation for the team and for Frazier, who called every day while his daughter was in the hospital and remains in touch.
Jacobson, an attorney, said he hasn't initiated any litigation over his daughter's accident and doesn't know whether he will.
Historically, when injured fans have sued, the defense for MLB and teams has been the longstanding ""Baseball Rule,"" whereby fans assume the risk, as noted on the back of tickets. But there are current, ongoing challenges in the courts.
As for the health challenges ahead for Jacobson's daughter, he said she'll have periodic appointments with a neurologist for years, and the hope is she won't have long-term issues from the head trauma.
""My daughter is the toughest person I ever met,"" Jacobson said. ""She has met every challenge and endured all the pain and discomfort without much complaint. I am in awe of her every day. It's really a miracle and nothing short of a blessing to watch my daughter laugh and play and be a 2-year-old seemingly without a care in the world.
""One day, my daughter will be old enough to process all of this, and maybe she'll even write her college application essay about it. I hope 15 years from now, when she writes it, that the story is about how she was the last person to be seriously hurt at a baseball game, or at the very least, it was a turning point for taking fan safety seriously. Many teams extended netting after her injury, so there is definitely some good that has come of it. We just want the story to finish with a positive outcome.""

ARLINGTON, Texas -- If taking the ball on Opening Day is a mark of excellence, Justin Verlander belongs to a select group. On Thursday afternoon at Globe Life Park, he became the 18th pitcher in Major League Baseball history to start 10 season openers. CC Sabathia and Felix Hernandez are the only other active pitchers who can make that claim.
Verlander’s first nine openers came as the Detroit Tigers’ resident ace, so with the rare exception, he took the mound with a chill in the air. In 2012, the game-time temperature at Comerica Park was 43 degrees when he pitched eight shutout innings in a win over the Boston Red Sox. A year later, it was 35 degrees with 17 mph winds when he threw five scoreless innings in a 4-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Target Field in Minneapolis. Sled dogs were optional.
In Verlander’s first Opening Day start with the Houston Astros, the sun was out and the temperature crept into the low 70s, and he experienced the sensation of playing a regular-season game in late March without seeing his teammates wrapped in parkas in the dugout.
“It was a nice change of pace,” Verlander said. “You don’t think about the weather when you’re out there pitching. But it’s nice to be able to feel the ball.”
He is literally and figuratively warming to the next chapter of his career amid the comforts of the American League West.
Verlander shut down the Texas Rangers' lineup over six four-hit innings before Houston manager A.J. Hinch lifted him with 91 pitches in the ledger. The Astros were within an out of a shutout when closer Ken Giles gave up a run on a wild pitch in the ninth to account for Texas’ only score in a 4-1 Houston victory.
This game served as a reminder why Houston general manager Jeff Luhnow jumped through so many hoops to pry Verlander loose from the Tigers in a five-player trade in late August, and it showed why the Astros were downright euphoric over having Verlander and Gerrit Cole join a rotation that already included Dallas Keuchel, Lance McCullers Jr. and Charlie Morton.
“We have a rotation full of aces,” Houston third baseman Alex Bregman said. “Every day when we wake up, we get to play behind one of the best pitchers in the game, so it’s always going to be fun coming to the ballpark.”
Thursday’s opener featured something old and something new for the defending champions. George Springer, who was last seen demoralizing the Los Angeles Dodgers’ pitching staff in the World Series, hit a solo homer off Cole Hamels leading off the top of the first inning to give Houston a lead it never surrendered. As the Elias Sports Bureau notes, the homer off Hamels and his 2017 Opening Day dinger against Hernandez make Springer the first player to go deep to start a game in consecutive season openers.
The Astros also unveiled their four-man outfield alignment, which features Bregman stationed in left field and Josh Reddick, Jake Marisnick and Springer sliding over to enhance the Astros’ coverage in the pasture. Hinch used the strategy four times against Joey Gallo, and Texas’ big first baseman responded with three fly outs and a strikeout. The first one nestled in Bregman’s glove in left.
“It’s a lot further away, and it’s harder to see,” Bregman said. “When Gallo hits you a fly ball, it’s usually very high, so it’s a little nerve-wracking. I think our front office and our coaching staff know what they’re doing, and they play the numbers, so it’s fine.”

Everything looks easier when Verlander is cutting a swath through opposing lineups, and he was efficient until the sixth inning, when he allowed back-to-back singles to Elvis Andrus and Adrian Beltre and had to dig deep to strike out Nomar Mazara to end the threat.
Verlander averaged 95 mph with his fastball and topped out at 97, and he put up zeroes on a day when it was a challenge to throw the ball past the Texas hitters. The Rangers swung at 41 pitches and missed only nine.
The outing continued a pattern of excellence that Verlander established after joining the Astros from the Tigers. Between the regular season and the postseason, he went 9-1 with a 1.66 ERA, 81 strikeouts, 13 walks and a .164 opponents’ batting average for Houston in 2017. Not that there was anything wrong with his pitching before the trade, but he seemed invigorated by the change of scenery.
Several months and a world championship ring later, Verlander was grateful for the opportunity to christen another season in his new environs.
“It’s special,” Verlander said. “Opening Day is always special. There’s so much atmosphere. There’s the intensity. It’s a really unique experience, and I cherish every single one of them. The one I probably remember most is my first Opening Day [in 2006], when I wasn’t even pitching. I was just a fan sitting there and enjoying it. It was kind of a full-circle moment.”
Verlander is quickly building a fan base in Houston, and it emanates from the stands to the home clubhouse. The Astros have seen how he elevates the level of performance of the entire staff with his work ethic, positive example and professional advice. He’ll be around for 33 or 34 starts this season, and his new teammates consider each one a gift and a pleasure to behold.
“He’s a Hall-of-Famer-in-waiting,” Springer said. “As a player, you understand when you’re playing with greatness. And he’s it.”

Get everything you need to prepare for your fantasy baseball drafts here, including rankings and analysis from ESPN's team of experts.
You'll increasingly hear this phrase echo around fantasy baseball circles, and it exemplifies the greatest flaws in rankings and cheat sheets. Those of us who have played this game for years are probably experts at organizing players by their anticipated value.
Here's the problem: These things identify only one possible outcome for each player -- his most middle-of-the-road result.
What about the players with the widest range of potential outcomes? Call them whatever you wish, boom/bust, risk/reward, upside/downside -- or high-ceiling/low-floor -- these are the players who very often play the most major parts in your championship quest.
Take Bryce Harper, for example. In the past four seasons (working forward), the 2015 National League MVP has finished No. 353, No. 7, No. 93 and No. 50 on the ESPN Player Rater. Bear in mind that at the time he injured his knee last Aug. 12, he graded out a clear top-10-overall player as well. During this span, he had four different months with at least a .350 batting average, 8 HRs and 20 RBIs. During this same time, he averaged just 128 games played per year.

It's back! Signups are open for the 2018 fantasy baseball season.

Get rankings and more for your draft.
Harper possesses one of the highest statistical ceilings of anyone in fantasy baseball, which is largely the reason so many -- this columnist included -- are willing to consistently spend a first-round pick on him. At the same time, his is one of the lowest floors of anyone ranked anywhere close to that range. These are traits that must be accounted for when you're examining any set of rankings. Are you willing to take the chance that this will be one of those years where everything clicks, Harper stays healthy and another MVP-caliber year results, or does the bust risk for the lofty price tag scare you?
Conversely, Anthony Rizzo has been eerily consistent during that same four-year span, especially over the past three seasons. From 2015 to 2017, Rizzo's annual average stat line is 157 games played, .281/.388/.521 slash rates, 32 home runs, 106 RBIs and 96 runs scored. During that three-year span, he never finished further from that annual average than three games played, 11 points of batting average, four points of on-base percentage, 23 points of slugging percentage, one home run, five RBIs or three runs scored. Few players can claim that level of consistency.
Though it's somewhat unfair to term Rizzo as ""low-ceiling"" -- his median-expectation stats are awfully high-grade -- in relative terms, his ceiling is pretty close to his median projection, as is his floor. He's one of the most predictable stars in baseball.
This column is for the Harper fans of the fantasy baseball world -- the ones who want to know where these highest ceilings and lowest floors reside. These are my annual bold predictions, which bring an additional dimension to my rankings, identifying the players who have the widest range of potential outcomes.
Use them as you wish. Jot down notes about them on your cheat sheet, so you know where to find the most potential profits during your draft. Or merely print them out and put them in a safe place until October so you can call me out on how many of them I ultimately got wrong. It's all good. After all, I got my Michael Conforto, Robbie Ray and Luis Severino predictions almost spot-on in 2017. I also horribly, horribly missed with my Tyler Glasnow, Jim Johnson and Seung-Hwan Oh predictions.
That's how this kind of thing goes. Remember, this is the risk/reward, or rather, the high-ceiling/low-floor prediction game. You're identifying the best (or worst) possible outcome for the player in question -- the 5 percent at the extremes.
Another thing about predictions: How ""bold"" they are is a relative thing. Some of these might seem fairly obvious to some, but completely bonkers to others. I try to account for a wide range of players, positions and categories. They are also listed in alphabetical order by player so you can easily find a specific name.
Here we go!
Javier Baez and Addison Russell will combine to hit 50-plus home runs.
The Cleveland Indians will become the first team in baseball history to have three different pitchers strike out at least 225 batters, with Trevor Bauer becoming their newest entrant to this group. (This one's perhaps less ""bold"" than some others, but it highlights how remarkable it is that it has never previously been done.)
Greg Bird will hit more home runs than Aaron Judge.
Alex Bregman will become only the second infielder in history to manage at least a .310 batting average, 35 home runs and 15 stolen bases in a season played before his 25th birthday, joining Alex Rodriguez (1996, 1998 and 2000).
Walker Buehler's final numbers will look almost identical to Luis Castillo's from 2017, including the 15 starts.
Byron Buxton will become only the 10th player in history to manage at least 20 home runs and 40 stolen bases in a single season played at the age of 24 or younger. (Hey, if I keep predicting it, it's bound to eventually happen, right? But seriously, his 2017 second half fully supports this possibility.)
Kole Calhoun, who has never managed more than 83 RBIs in a single year in his career, will plate 105 runners in 2018.
Nicholas Castellanos will hit 40-plus home runs.
Matt Chapman will hit more home runs than Matt Olson.
Alex Claudio will save 30-plus games.
Willson Contreras will finish at least 25 overall spots ahead of Buster Posey on the Player Rater.
Patrick Corbin will effectively replicate his 2013 final-season numbers, finishing among the top-25 starting pitchers on the Player Rater.
Sean Doolittle will finish the year a top-five fantasy closer.
Steven Duggar will win the San Francisco Giants' starting center field job and manage at least 12 home runs and 24 stolen bases.
Adam Eaton will pick up right where he left off, scoring 120 runs -- with 20 stolen bases in the process.
Carl Edwards Jr. will lead the Chicago Cubs in saves while striking out 100-plus batters.
Mychal Givens will not only lead the Baltimore Orioles in saves, he'll do so by recording at least twice as many as any other member of the staff.
Delino DeShields will double his career total of 32 stolen bases en route to capturing the American League's crown in the category.
Nathan Eovaldi will strike out 150-plus hitters.
Marco Estrada will post an ERA no greater than 3.50 while setting a new personal best in strikeouts. His current best is 176, set last season.
Wilmer Flores will hit more home runs than Asdrubal Cabrera, Jose Reyes and Amed Rosario combined.
Dexter Fowler will manage his first career 20/20 season, while scoring 100-plus runs.
Kyle Gibson will strike out more than 170 batters while posting an ERA below 4.00.
Though he'll ultimately fall just short in his quest, Marco Gonzales will mount a serious challenge to James Paxton for the highest spot among Seattle Mariners starting pitchers on the Player Rater.
Yasmani Grandal will hit 30-plus home runs.
Jon Gray will strike out 200-plus batters.
Vladimir Guerrero Jr. will make his major league debut at the age of 19, at least one month before Sept. 16 (which would be his half-birthday, so he'd be 19 1/2), and he'll bat at least .300 in the games he gives you.
Brad Hand will join Kenley Jansen as the only relievers with at least 30 saves and 100 strikeouts.
The Diamondbacks' leader in saves this season will be Greg Holland, who shuts the door at least 30 times.
Chris Iannetta will deliver fantasy managers at least 20 home runs and 60 walks.
Tommy Kahnle will be the highest-finishing relief pitcher on the Player Rater who fails to notch at least five saves.
Jason Kipnis will finally stay healthy enough to have that season of .280, 20 HRs, 15 SBs. He has reached each threshold previously, just never in the same year. And he'll do it if only because I don't have him on a single team this year.
Manny Machado will become the fourth shortstop in history to hit 40-plus home runs, and the first to do it since Alex Rodriguez (1998-2003).
Jose Martinez will find his way into 500-plus plate appearances and bat at least .290 with 20 home runs
Nomar Mazara will hit 30-plus home runs.
Lance McCullers Jr. will finally stay healthy enough to strike out 200-plus batters.
Francisco Mejia, currently DH-only in ESPN leagues, will play enough at catcher to earn in-season qualification there, but he'll also play well enough to finish among the top 15 at the position on the Player Rater.
Wil Myers will become the second San Diego Padres hitter to hit 40-plus home runs since the opening of Petco Park in 2004, joining Adrian Gonzalez (2009).
Roberto Osuna will shave off more than a run and a half from his 2017 ERA (3.38) while saving at least 40 games.
Blake Parker will save at least 25 more games than Cam Bedrosian will.
Jose Pirela will hit 20-plus home runs while adding in-season position eligibility at both second and third base.
Stephen Piscotty will surpass both of his 2016 totals of a .273 batting average and 22 home runs.
Nick Pivetta will have a 4.25 ERA or lower and at least 170 strikeouts, placing himself clearly among the ""roster-worthy"" fantasy starting pitchers in mixed leagues.
Despite not being recalled until May 15, A.J. Puk will finish the year the highest-ranked Oakland Athletics starting pitcher on the Player Rater.
Wilson Ramos will finish among the top-five catchers on the Player Rater.
Eduardo Rodriguez will finish among the top-35 starting pitchers on the Player Rater.
Nick Senzel will be recalled on May 1 and finish second in the National League Rookie of the Year balloting.
Jorge Soler will hit 30-plus home runs.
Drew Steckenrider will take over the Miami closer role no later than Memorial Day and will save 25 games for them.
Whether he makes the Reds' Opening Day rotation or not, Robert Stephenson will strike out 150-plus hitters.
Jameson Taillon will finish among the top-25 starting pitchers on the Player Rater.
Mike Trout will become only the fourth player in history to bat at least .320 with 40 home runs and 25 stolen bases in a season, joining Barry Bonds (1993), Ellis Burks (1996) and Larry Walker (1997).
Jonathan Villar will steal 40-plus bases, starting a new streak of consecutive seasons with at least that many thefts. He had four in a row at all professional levels combined from 2013-16.
Kolten Wong will become the first St. Louis Cardinals player to steal 25-plus bases in a season since Tony Womack in 2004.

NEW YORK -- Mets reliever Anthony Swarzak has been placed on the 10-day disabled list because of a strained left side.
The 32-year-old right-hander left Saturday's game against St. Louis and said he had never felt soreness in his oblique muscle.
New York recalled right-hander Hansel Robles from Triple-A Las Vegas on Tuesday. He was 7-5 with a 4.92 ERA in 46 relief appearances last year.
Swarzak's move to the disabled list was made retroactive to Sunday.

BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers have made a trade involving a pair of minor league pitchers.
The Orioles obtained left-hander Luis Ysla, and the Dodgers got right-hander Jesus Liranzo on Monday.
Ysla, 25, has played five seasons in the minors, reaching Triple-A in 2016 with Pawtucket of the Boston Red Sox organization.
Ysla is 16-23 with 3.93 ERA in 147 games, including 44 starts. He will be assigned to Double-A Bowie.
Liranzo, 23, has not played above the Double-A level since breaking into professional baseball with the Atlanta Braves organization in 2012.

It's a weird week with off days for teams on each weekday, so keep an eye on schedules and make sure you're getting a full lineup.
It seems to be only aces or streamers on Tuesday's slate, though all three starting pitcher picks could find themselves in this column regularly or even kept on as longer-term options. It's hard to make anything of early-season hitting numbers, so a few of the batter options are players you can consider holding beyond Tuesday.
Ty Blach (L), 8 percent, San Francisco Giants vs. Seattle Mariners: Blach enjoyed a sharp debut against Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers, earning the win with five scoreless innings, scattering three hits and three walks and fanning three. The Mariners registered just the 23rd-best slugging percentage against lefties in 2017, and Nelson Cruz could be out with an ankle injury that might lead to a stint on the disabled list. Blach doesn't miss a ton of bats, but he keeps the ball down (career 1.5 ground ball-to-fly ball ratio). With two key power hitters likely out (Mike Zunino is already on the DL and could be joined by Cruz) and the two others being lefties (Kyle Seager and Robinson Cano), this sets up nicely for Blach.
Jack Flaherty (R), 13 percent, St. Louis Cardinals at Milwaukee Brewers: Flaherty is the kind of early-season gamble who can turn into a full-on roster piece in short order. The 22-year-old got a chance when Adam Wainwright had to start on the DL, and Flaherty has the raw stuff to parlay that opportunity into an extended look. In the short term, he's a strikeout arm (24 percent career strikeout rate in the minors) facing the team that had the highest strikeout rate against righties last year (26 percent); so even if he doesn't put up a total gem, he should rack up some punchouts.
Tyson Ross (R), 1 percent, San Diego Padres vs. Colorado Rockies: He was a nightmare in 49 innings with Texas last year (7.71 ERA and horrible skills to ""support"" it), but he always has been someone who is quite good when healthy. And he looked healthy in a strong Cactus League performance that earned him a starting role. He has a career 2.81 ERA and 1.11 WHIP in 257 innings at Petco Park, and he has been sharp against the Rockies, whether home or away, with a 3.44 ERA/1.27 WHIP combo in 55 innings.
It has been a haves/have nots league with bullpens thus far, as nearly half are touting a sub-3.00 ERA, while the other half is sitting at 4.60 or above (10 of those are north of 5.00) through a weekend. Of course, no contingent is more prone to volatility than bullpens, let alone the fact that there has been just a few days' worth of games. Injuries are still the driving force behind any changes, and any stars (let's say the top 12 or so drafted closers) should be given more than a bad outing or two before you consider cutting them from your team.
GS is the projected game score for the pitcher. The ""*"" symbol means the pitcher lacks requisite career major league data to produce an accurate rating; these are the author's ratings.
Note: W-L, ERA and WHIP are full-year 2017 statistics
Tucker Barnhart (B), 8 percent, Cincinnati Reds vs. Chicago Cubs (Jon Lester): Part of this relates to my overarching belief that Barnhart is going to have a breakout year with the bat, but it's also based on some general negativity toward Lester's outlook. This isn't just about his Opening Day look against the Marlins, but he just didn't look like Jon Lester throughout much of 2017. A Barnhart breakout will be driven by power and will likely require some improvement against lefties, so why not start here against Lester?
Matt Adams (L), 1 percent, Washington Nationals at Atlanta Braves (Julio Teheran): Keep a close eye on this one to ensure he's in the lineup, but the Nats definitely should start him. On his own merits, Adams is a monster against righties over his career with an .829 OPS in 1,516 PA, and it surged to .896 last year. Add in the issues that Teheran has with lefties in general (career .789 OPS) and that were only exacerbated in his new home venue, Suntrust Park (.927 vs. lefties last year), and Adams seems like an easy start both for the Nats and your fantasy team.
Kolten Wong (L), 9 percent, St. Louis Cardinals at Milwaukee Brewers (Brandon Woodruff): Wong holds a 149-point OPS advantage against righties with a .761 OPS from 2015 to 2017, including a big .810 mark last year. His plate approach continues to improve, as he walked a career-high 10 percent of the time last year. Woodruff had but a 46-inning cup of coffee last year, though it didn't take long for lefties to get comfortable with him, as he yielded a .345/.396/.476 line with 29 hits against just 13 strikeouts.
Derek Dietrich (L), 5 percent, Miami Marlins vs. Boston Red Sox (Chris Sale): I understand it's not the strongest expected value (EV) to go lefty-lefty against Sale, but I'm pushing a little beyond the boundaries of the column's title (Daily Notes) to put Dietrich on your radar. He's getting a full-time opportunity as the No. 2 hitter in Miami's lineup. He's a career plus-value hitter with a 108 wRC+ (8 percent better than league average). The Marlins aren't great, but the top four of Lewis Brinson, Dietrich, Starlin Castro and Justin Bour are capable. J.T. Realmuto will extend the lineup even more. As for this game specifically, Dietrich did manage an .816 OPS against lefties last year, and he already is 3-of-10 against them so far this year.
Tim Anderson (R), 50 percent, Chicago White Sox at Toronto Blue Jays (J.A. Happ): A bit overlooked because of his sketchy plate approach, Anderson did pop 17 home runs and swipe 15 bases last year (in 16 tries). He has a career .323/.336/.470 line against lefties in 258 plate appearances. He started the year off right with a homer against lefty Danny Duffy in a two-homer Opening Day (the other against Blaine Boyer). Happ isn't a big strikeout guy (21 percent since 2014), nor does he really walk guys (seven percent since 2014), so Anderson's free-swinging ways might go unchecked.
Matt Chapman, (R), 55 percent, Oakland Athletics vs. Texas Rangers (Cole Hamels): I've got to cheat a bit on the 50 percent threshold as a public service to ensure Chapman gets on more rosters and not just for a matchup against Hamels. He was a bit overshadowed by Matt Olson last year, but he also put together a great second half. He also did it on both sides of the ball, and while defense doesn't directly relate to fantasy -- in that it's not captured as a scoring device in many (or any?) leagues -- it does play a role in who starts. Chapman's Gold Glove-caliber defense ensures his lineup spot. Righties had a 266-point OPS advantage against Hamels, as compared to lefties last year with a .749 OPS.
Ryan Flaherty (L), 3 percent, Atlanta Braves vs. Washington Nationals (A.J. Cole): Flaherty is firing on all cylinders after securing a strong-side platoon role at third base in Atlanta (still needs a few games to earn that 3B eligibility), so let's play the hot hand a bit. The 31-year-old utility man always has been more of a defense-only than defense-first player, but he has hits in his first three games, including four on Saturday. Cole allowed lefties to hit .320/.421/.553 off him last year. He actually dominated righties, creating an interesting split, in which his batting average against lefties (.320) was greater than his slugging percentage against righties (.315).
Nick Markakis (L), 22 percent, Atlanta Braves vs. Washington Nationals (A.J. Cole): Markakis is not a power source, which is why he's so regularly available in most formats, but he has managed a solid .778 OPS against righties since 2015. He's batting cleanup too. A heart-of-the-order lineup slot for a solid hitter should mean he is on rosters in more than 22 percent of leagues. At worst, he'll club a ton of doubles to cash in the runners and become a points-league beast. Markakis' 431 doubles are third most in baseball since joining the league in 2006, behind only Cano (478) and Miguel Cabrera (450). See Flaherty's recommendation at middle Infield for notes on why Cole is susceptible to lefties.
Derek Fisher (L), 3 percent, Houston Astros vs. Baltimore Orioles (Mike Wright): The widely heralded prospect put up a .293/.361/.532 line against righties last year in the minors, with 21 homers in 418 plate appearances. He never really kicked into gear in 166 plate appearances with the Astros last year, but all five of his homers came against righties. Wright has allowed an abysmal .328/.384/.578 line against lefties during his career.
Curtis Granderson (L), 8 percent, Toronto Blue Jays vs. Chicago White Sox (Carson Fulmer): Even as the batting average continues to crater, Granderson maintains his value against righties. He bats in the top half of the order and is always a threat to go yard. He had a .256 ISO against righties last year too.
Hitter ratings account for the opposing starting pitcher's history (three years' worth), as well as ballpark factors. ""LH"" and ""RH"" ratings account only for left- and right-handed batters, respectively.
Weighted on-base average (wOBA) is the primary statistic used in the calculation. Ratings range from 1 to 10, with 10 representing the best possible matchup, statistically speaking, and 1 representing the worst. For example, a 10 is a must-start rating, while a 1 should be avoided (if possible); a 1-2 is poor, 3-4 is fair, 5-6 is average, 7-8 is very good and 9-10 is excellent.

The Dallas Cowboys announced on Tuesday that they have opted out of the NFL's deal with Ticketmaster and have elected to give their primary box office business to ticket reseller SeatGeek.
Terms were not disclosed. The Cowboys also have purchased an undisclosed stake in the company.
""We honestly thought we would continue with Ticketmaster,"" said Chad Estis, the team's executive vice president of business operations. ""But we have a commitment to have the best in class and we thought that SeatGeek's technology from a fan standpoint and the ease of use and flexibility on the back end with our folks internally made this deal the right one.""
The Cowboys aren't the first team to opt out of the Ticketmaster deal. The Detroit Lions switched primary ticketing to Veritix for the 2013 season but will return to Ticketmaster for the 2018 season. The Cowboys and New Orleans Saints, who signed with SeatGeek in November, will be the only teams not currently part of the league deal.
The move is consistent with the history of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who famously struck deals with Pepsi and American Express in the 1990s, when the league had deals with Coca-Cola and Visa. The NFL sued but eventually dropped the case.
In 2002, Jones became only the owner to opt out of the NFL's licensing deal, which split revenues equally. Jones felt that the Cowboys contributed a disproportionate share and sought to be rewarded by going on his own to distribute and choose where he wanted the Cowboys gear to be sold. Sixteen years later, the Cowboys are still the only team that does that.
""The financials had to be right, but we also have an owner who isn't afraid to take a little risk,"" Estis said of the SeatGeek decision. ""We expect there could be a bump or two along the way.""
Estis said that being able to own a piece of the future business, instead of just being a customer, was also appealing.
SeatGeek's move into primary ticketing was enabled through its $56 million acquisition last year of ticketing software company TopTix.
The majority of SeatGeek's business is still the resale market, but the primary business has been growing.
Clients include five MLS teams, including the most robust franchises, Seattle Sounders FC and the Portland Timbers.
The deal with the Cowboys gives the brand even more credibility.
""We're thrilled that the Dallas Cowboys, the most valuable team in the world, has chosen us to be their partner,"" said SeatGeek co-founder Russ D'Souza. ""We think we have the best user experience for managing tickets.""
Cowboys fans will not be charged for transferring their tickets to other fans, unless they sell them on any one of three authenticated resale sites -- Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.
SeatGeek also was said to have won the Cowboys over by showing them how their ticketing software gives the team a better idea of who is actually sitting in the seat.
""The team has such a large fan base, it's hard to know exactly who is showing up and who they should be talking to,"" D'Souza said. ""They will know now.""

Tedy Bruschi says that he understands Jim Mora's comments about Josh Rosen, but they might have been harmful. (0:54)
Jim Mora made headlines last week when he said on NFL Network that if he were making the Cleveland Browns' pick at No. 1, he would select USC quarterback Sam Darnold over his former UCLA QB, Josh Rosen.
Mora cited ""fit"" and ""blue-collar, gritty attitude"" for why Darnold was better for the Browns than Rosen, whom he coached with the Bruins the past three seasons. Mora was fired by UCLA in November.
In an interview Sunday with Sports Illustrated, Mora stood by his opinion that Darnold is a better fit for the Browns. He added that he believes Rosen ""is the No. 1 quarterback in the draft"" and a ""franchise-changer,"" but said that the team that drafts him will need to challenge him.
""He needs to be challenged intellectually so he doesn't get bored. He's a millennial. He wants to know why. Millennials, once they know why, they're good. Josh has a lot of interests in life. If you can hold his concentration level and focus only on football for a few years, he will set the world on fire. He has so much ability, and he's a really good kid,"" Mora told Sports Illustrated.
Rosen took to Twitter Monday afternoon in an apparent reaction to Mora's comments.
Why? 🤷🏻‍♂️ #why
— Josh Rosen (@josh3rosen) April 2, 2018
Mora said he hasn't been contacted by any NFL teams yet to give his evaluation of Rosen.

The Oakland Raiders have signed receiver/special-teamer Dwayne Harris, the team announced Monday.
Terms were not released.
The New York Giants released Harris on March 22, saving more than $2.45 million on their salary cap. They originally signed him to a five-year, $17.5 million deal in 2015. They restructured his deal last season, a pay cut that could be recouped through incentives that he never ultimately hit.
Harris' first year with the Giants was promising -- he returned both a punt and a kickoff for a touchdown. He also set career highs in catches (36), yards (396) and touchdown receptions (four).
In recent seasons, however, Harris has failed to be the offensive factor the Giants had hoped he would be when they originally signed him from the Dallas Cowboys. Harris caught a touchdown pass on his only target in 2016, and he didn't have a ball thrown in his direction before his 2017 season was cut short.
Harris, 30, suffered a foot injury in a Week 5 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that required surgery. Harris passed his physical Thursday before being cut and is training for next season, as he expects to be ready for the start of the offseason workout program if he is signed in the coming weeks.
Harris was not offered a pay cut this offseason, a source told ESPN, as he wasn't going to be part of the Giants' plans -- counting more than $4 million against the salary cap.
The Cowboys originally selected Harris in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL draft out of East Carolina. He immediately made his mark in Dallas on special teams, ranking second in the NFL with an average of 16.1 yards per punt return in 2012. He had two returns for touchdowns in his first three professional seasons.

The New York Jets claimed former Oakland Raiders tight end Clive Walford off waivers on Monday.
The Jets were in need of a tight end after Austin Seferian-Jenkins signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency. Seferian-Jenkins had 50 receptions for 357 yards and three touchdowns in 2017.
Before adding Walford, the only other tight ends on the Jets' roster were Eric Tomlinson, who had eight receptions for 121 yards and a touchdown in 2017, and Jordan Leggett, who missed all of last season after suffering a knee injury in the preseason.
Walford, 26, played in 13 games last season for the Raiders, finishing with nine receptions for 80 yards. He was a bigger part of Oakland's passing game in 2015 and '16, finishing with 61 receptions for 788 yards and six touchdowns combined.
The Raiders selected him in the third round (68th overall) in the 2015 draft.

The Philadelphia Eagles have agreed to terms with former Detroit Lions linebacker Paul Worrilow on a one-year contract.
Worrilow, 27, signed a one-year deal with the Lions last year and ended up as a rotational linebacker. He played in 13 games, starting eight, and finished with 30 tackles and a fumble recovery.
Worrilow will add competition to an Eagles linebacker group that includes Jordan Hicks, Nigel Bradham, Mychal Kendricks and the recently acquired Corey Nelson. Kendricks has been the subject of trade speculation for the second straight offseason. The Eagles have options should they move him.
Worrilow should also help on special teams, an area of focus for the Eagles. He was a core special-teams player for the Lions last season, playing close to half of the special-teams snaps.
He came to Detroit from the Atlanta Falcons, where he made the team as an undrafted free agent out of Delaware in 2013.
Worrilow has played in 72 career games, making 412 tackles with four sacks and two interceptions.

The Arizona Cardinals have signed free-agent wide receiver Brice Butler to a two-year contract.
Monday's move addresses one of the team's biggest needs, depth at the receiver position, following the departures of John Brown and Jaron Brown to free agency.
Butler, entering his sixth NFL season, played the past three seasons with the Dallas Cowboys and totaled 43 catches for 794 yards and six touchdowns while serving mostly as the No. 4 receiver behind Dez Bryant, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley.
Butler was selected by Oakland in the seventh round out of San Diego State in the 2013 draft and played his first two seasons with the Raiders.
Overall, the 28-year-old receiver has appeared in 61 games, with 73 catches for 1,177 yards and eight touchdowns.

Newly signed QB Kirk Cousins expresses his thoughts on joining the Vikings and how he will handle the pressures of high expectations that Minnesota will have. (1:32)
When Kirk Cousins joins his new teammates once the Minnesota Vikings begin their voluntary offseason training program April 16, the quarterback will be handed the reins to an offense predicated upon his strengths.
“We’re going to do what Cousins does best,” Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said at the NFL's annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, last week. “He’s the most important player, really, on the offense.
“Obviously, we’ve got the playbook in, all the installation and all that stuff. That can all go out the window when we get our hands on it and get to know exactly what he’s doing and what he feels comfortable with. You don’t pay that guy that much money to try to put him in a square hole.”
The Vikings guaranteed $84 million to Cousins with the belief that an upgrade at quarterback is what will bring them their first Super Bowl win. Here’s what Minnesota’s offense could look like with its franchise QB at the helm and a coaching staff aiming to maximize his strengths.
Building the foundation
John DeFilippo has to be ecstatic about the opportunity in front of him.
During his time in the NFL as an offensive coordinator (Browns 2015) and quarterbacks coach (Raiders 2007-08, 2012-14; Jets 2009; Eagles 2016-17), DeFilippo has had a different starting quarterback in each season opener from 2012 to 2016. Carson Wentz was the only quarterback he has been able to coach in consecutive seasons since 2012. And even then, DeFilippo had to work with a different starting quarterback (Nick Foles) just three weeks before the end of the regular season when Wentz tore his ACL.
Cousins’ three-year deal gives the Vikings some much-needed stability at the quarterback position. Once their new offensive coordinator gets a chance to dive into the initial workings of what he has installed for the offense, it’s likely he’ll want to lay the groundwork for a long-term relationship with Cousins the way he did with Foles when he took over for Wentz.
“I sat [Foles] down and made him list me with our coaching staff: ‘What are your best concepts? What do you see yourself do well?’ Because ... myself, Frank Reich, Doug Pederson, we’re not the ones out there throwing it -- he is,” DeFilippo said on 1500 ESPN Twin Cities during Super Bowl week. “We sat down and spent time with Nick formulating game plans on what he felt comfortable doing. For me, that’s coaching. Why would you ask a player to do something that he’s not comfortable with?”
Those early offseason meetings between Cousins and his offensive coordinator might look something like this:
“I would bring him in the room and ask him to tell me his five favorite routes from Washington,” ESPN NFL analyst Matt Bowen said. “'Tell me why you like them, why they fit our personnel and why we should run them.' Then, I [DeFilippo] would show him my favorite routes we ran in Philly and explain why I like them. Why can or can’t we run them? By the end of that, we’ll have 10 routes to start building out the playbook from there.""
The basis of what DeFilippo brings to Minnesota from Philadelphia is a modernized West Coast scheme with some added college spread-offense concepts, pre-snap movement and play-action. Those concepts created a number of open windows for one-on-one matchups for Wentz and Foles, giving both more time to find reads, something every quarterback desires.
“Doesn’t matter if you’re talking about Dan Marino or Kirk Cousins,” Bowen said. “They want the best matchup. They don’t want to be making 50-50 contested throws every time. You want to find reads, you want open throwing windows to stay in the pocket and rip the ball down the field. He’s going to have the opportunity to do that.”
Barring injury or a blockbuster trade, Cousins will be the Vikings' quarterback for a long time. It’s what he referred to as the potential for a “lifetime deal” during his introductory news conference in March. The basis of that is building a system around what the 29-year-old quarterback has demonstrated he can do well while finding ways to improve areas in which he has struggled.
Capitalizing on Cousins’ strengths 
During a span in which he threw for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in each of the past three seasons, Cousins posted the third-highest completion percentage and the seventh-best total QBR, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The only quarterback better in both categories was Drew Brees.
There are many reasons to look past his 26-30-1 regular-season career record and the fact that he has only started one playoff game to see why the Vikings view Cousins as their next franchise quarterback.
Play-action: Zimmer could hardly contain himself from reverting into full scouting mode when he introduced Cousins on March 15. In describing his new quarterback, the Vikings' coach harped on his biggest strength.
“He’s always been a very, very tough guy to play against -- very accurate, excellent in play-actions, terrific in the boots,” Zimmer said.
Cousins has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s best play-action passers, a concept coach Jay Gruden dialed up on 20 percent of the Redskins’ plays in 2017. In fact, Cousins' passer rating jumped up by 31.3 points when using play-action versus when the Redskins didn’t use it, going from 7.1 yards per attempt and an 87.4 QB rating without play-action to 9.4 yards per attempt and a 118.7 QB rating with it.
According to Pro Football Focus research, the Vikings ranked second in play-action pass attempts in 2017. Minnesota’s running backs accounted for 1,957 rushing yards last year and ranked second in the NFL in team rushing attempts. Considering Dalvin Cook’s pending return and how well Cousins does operating a ball fake, DeFilippo could choose to be aggressive when calling play-action passes.
DeFilippo also might bring a staple of the Eagles' offense to Minnesota.
Philadelphia dismantled teams all year, including the Vikings in the NFC Championship, with the use of the run-pass option. Why? Because its RPOs are made to look like play-action. And very rarely did Foles run the ball. The playcalls were dialed up for the Eagles' QB to get the ball out on a quick slant -- another version of a play-action pass with a harder sell on the play fake.
Cousins excels at getting the ball out quickly in a rhythm passing game and making accurate throws to his receivers. The formula the Eagles used with Foles and RPOs could be one DeFilippo adapts with Cousins.
“Doesn’t mean [Cousins] can’t throw the ball on a zone read every once in a while,” Bowen said. “He did in Washington. All you have to do, in my opinion, in the pro game is pull it twice a game. Just get it on film and make their defensive end hesitate a little bit. Now you’re opening up the cutback for Dalvin Cook. But Cousins’ movement skills are there, so you spring boot off play-action.”
Deep ball: Arm strength, accuracy and decision-making.
Over the past three seasons, Cousins has been one of the best QBs at throwing the ball deep (15 yards or more), ranking third in completion percentage (48.9), fifth in yards per attempt (13.7) and third in passing touchdowns (30) among 37 quarterbacks with 100 such attempts.
And he hasn’t done it by zeroing in on a single receiver. Since 2015, Cousins is one of four quarterbacks to have thrown at least five touchdowns to eight different receivers.
He was at his best when he had DeSean Jackson (17.9 yards per catch) and Pierre Garcon (13.2 YPC) as weapons in 2016, a season in which both receivers notched over 1,000 yards. Cousins' deep-ball production dipped in 2017 due to injuries to his receiving corps. He posted a 106.4 passer rating on 66 deep passes last year.
Cousins should see steady production with a deep passing game given the receivers he’ll have to work with. According to PFF research, Adam Thielen ranked first in deep-ball wide receiver rating in 2016 and Stefon Diggs third in that category last season.
Adding weapons: Philadelphia knew how to spread the ball around. That’s good news for Cousins as he embarks on the next phase of his career under DeFilippo.
Zach Ertz (824 yards, 8 TDs), Nelson Agholor (768 yards, 8 TDs) and Alshon Jeffery (789 yards, 9 TDs) accounted for a bulk of the production in the Eagles’ passing game last season. Torrey Smith was next with 430 yards receiving and two touchdowns, followed by Trey Burton’s five TDs and 248 receiving yards. Then there are the contributions of Mack Hollins, Corey Clement, Brent Celek, Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount -- all of whom caught touchdown passes.
Cook will pick up where he left off, providing Cousins with a pass-catching option out of the backfield. The recent addition of slot receiver Kendall Wright also gives the Vikings' offense the ability to maximize on Cousins’ intermediate accuracy.
What the Vikings are missing is an athletic, hybrid tight end to complement Kyle Rudolph -- another big-framed body who can shield defenders at the point of attack and also go up and get the ball. This is especially critical in the red zone (more on that below). The Eagles consistently used Ertz, Burton and Celek in multiple-tight end sets based on their various roles. Rudolph was the Vikings' top red zone threat in 2017. Finding a move tight end, someone with speed who can make tough catches, would be the perfect addition for Cousins.
Fixing his flaws
DeFilippo will have the majority of his work cut out for him with Cousins on third down and in the red zone.
Cousins produced a passing first down on just 30.4 percent of his dropbacks on third down last season, with a completion percentage of 57.2 percent in such situations, according to ESPN Stats & Info research. PFF ranked Cousins 31st among qualifying QBs on third down.
In the red zone, Cousins had the fourth-most turnover-worthy plays the past two seasons, according to PFF research. The Redskins were 14th in red zone scoring during Cousins' first year as a starter, dipped to 28th in 2016 and bounced back to 14th last season.
The good news? DeFilippo’s influence might help Cousins improve upon his 83.3 QB rating inside the 20-yard line.
In Wentz’s rookie season, the quarterback posted a 35.8 QBR in the red zone, threw 12 TDs and one interception and rushed for two scores. In his second year under DeFilippo, Wentz threw 23 touchdowns and no interceptions inside the 20-yard line with a 96.7 QBR and 64.9 completion percentage. In both years, Wentz never lost a fumble in the red zone.
Fumbles have been an issue for Cousins at a concerning rate. He fumbled 31 times (11 lost) over the past three seasons, including a career-high 13 in 2017. Luckily, weather won’t be a factor in at least eight home games each year from now on.
There’s a long way to go, and while the Vikings have begun building around Cousins' strengths, they’ll also look to find ways to mitigate his flaws.
“One of the biggest areas he can improve upon is being more efficient in the red zone,” Bowen said. “He has to make those tight-window throws. Those disappear so quickly.”

The NFL and Las Vegas have grown up together, an upstart sports league from the East Coast and a liberal city in the desert coming of age to emerge as icons in American culture.
During the Super Bowl era, the NFL overtook baseball, the national pastime, to become America's favorite sport. At the same time, Las Vegas was separating itself from the mob and blossoming into an ""entertainment mecca"" -- to use NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's words.
Even so, the NFL always maintained its distance from Las Vegas, concerned that the city's legal sports betting would tarnish the integrity of its game. In 2013, the league said it wouldn't even consider playing an exhibition game in the city because of sports betting.
Five years later, the NFL and Las Vegas are moving in together. The Raiders are on their way from Oakland, and the sports betting concerns have been addressed.
In fact, one of the earliest steps Raiders owner Mark Davis took in the Las Vegas relocation process was to examine the sports betting issue. It began with an on-field chat, before a 2014 home game against the Broncos, which three months later led to a hush-hush meeting in Las Vegas. The result was a blueprint for how professional sports teams and legal sports betting can co-exist.
This is the story behind the report that helped the Raiders get comfortable with Las Vegas.
Campus police were stationed outside the gray, stone building that sits inconspicuously across a parking lot from the UNLV soccer fields. The meeting inside needed to be kept quiet, so quiet that some attendees purposely left it off their official appointment calendars to maintain secrecy. If word of this Feb. 23, 2015, meeting would have leaked, the future of the NFL and Las Vegas could have been altered.
In a first-floor exhibit room at the UNLV International Gaming Research Center, blackjack tables, roulette wheels and the latest slot machines were on display for students and guests to examine. Two floors up, in an executive boardroom, Mark Davis sat in a tan leather swivel chair, listening intently at one end of a conference table.
Outside the windows, the skyline of the Las Vegas Strip, with its massive casinos, could be seen on the horizon. It's the epicenter of American sports betting, but was it a fit for the NFL? The topic was on the table.
The previous summer, according to an ESPN The Magazine report, Davis had expressed interest in Las Vegas to an NFL official during a West Hollywood meal. He was told then that the league would oppose any such move ""on principal.""
The most glaring principal difference between Las Vegas and other cities isn't casino gambling -- it's sports betting, the legal kind, anyway. Forty states have casinos, according to the American Gaming Association. Only Nevada, however, can offer a legal bet on the Super Bowl. And that makes the NFL nervous -- even though sports betting currently takes place in every state and every stadium via the dozens of offshore sportsbooks that serve the U.S. online.
The February 2015 meeting at the gaming research center was the first between UNLV and the Raiders. It took place a year before Davis appeared in a picture with influential billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and was kept secret for three years afterward.
Napoleon McCallum, a former Raiders running back and now the director of community development for Las Vegas Sands Corp., was sitting between the parties. As a fan of both sides of the table, McCallum made this meeting happen.
The Las Vegas side of the table was excited, though skeptical of the Raiders' intentions. Prominent UNLV official Don Snyder, who had spent the past year as the school's president, was in the room. Snyder has had a hand in some of Las Vegas' most ambitious projects such as the downtown Fremont Experience and, more recently, the $470 million Smith Center for Performing Arts. He's well-connected in town. This meeting was the first he was learning of interest from the Raiders. Everyone hoped this was the beginning of something special, but it was early in the game.
At the time, the Raiders' focus remained on Los Angeles or finding a way to stay in Oakland. Davis didn't want any news of the meeting at UNLV to damage those discussions. There were many other suitors, too. San Antonio was interested; so was Sacramento. Casual inquiries came from Calgary and Mexico. Among the primary candidates, Las Vegas was the long-shot bachelorette with a history of gambling.
At the other end of the table, across from Davis, was Bo Bernhard, executive director of the International Gaming Institute. A former captain of the Harvard baseball team, Bernhard is forward-thinking, humble, witty and a leading authority on gambling.
When Davis pointed at him during the meeting and said, ""You're the most important person in the room,"" Bernhard, in a deadpan response, looked over his shoulder and thought, Is he talking about me?
""Napoleon tells me you have all the answers,"" Davis said. ""Lay it out for me.""
McCallum played six seasons with the Raiders (1986, 1990-94), splitting carries with Hall of Famer Marcus Allen, while early on also fulfilling his commitment to the U.S. Naval Academy. His playing career ended in gruesome fashion: In the 1994 season-opener against the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football, he suffered a dislocated knee, resulting in three torn ligaments and severe nerve and artery damage.
McCallum moved to Nevada shortly after his injury and now lives with his wife, Yvonne, and their four daughters in Henderson, a Las Vegas suburb. He loves the city. ""Everyone's looking to be friends,"" he said. He also loves the Raiders, and, for years, envisioned bringing his new home and his former team together, but kept running into the same line of resistance.
""Anytime I'd mention it to someone, the first thing they'd say was, 'But the gaming, the gaming,'"" McCallum recalled from his office at The Venetian during a February interview with ESPN. ""They were worried about the integrity of the game.""
On its face, sports betting's threat to the integrity of the game is match-fixing -- a player, coach or official purposely trying to impact an outcome inside the competition for gambling purposes. That's only one part of the NFL's concern, however.
In 1963, Paul Hornung of the Green Bay Packers and Alex Karras of the Detroit Lions were suspended for betting on NFL games. Commissioner Pete Rozelle insisted there were ""no bribes, no game-fixing or point-shaving,"" and that all of the bets ""were on their own team or on other NFL games."" Later in the '60s, rumors of a connection between Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson and known gambler Don ""Dice"" Dawson (no relation) caused some bookmakers to halt betting on Chiefs games. Looking back, some Las Vegas bookmakers and bettors who were active at the time question whether there was any actual substance behind the Dawson rumors.

Where do we stand in the move toward the legalization of sports betting in the United States? Here is ESPN Chalk's one-stop shop of all relevant content, as we await to Supreme Court's ruling on the New Jersey case.
Las Vegas has become a March destination for fans of four different college hoops conferences, while bettors spill out of Vegas sportsbooks during NCAA tournament week. The NCAA still wants nothing to do with Vegas -- but the tide could be turning.
Fifty years later, the NFL has avoided any major gambling scandals. Hundreds of players, coaches, league officials, referees and trainers have come and gone through the league, and no one has revealed concrete proof of any game being manipulated for gambling purposes. Player and coach contracts have grown to the point that they far exceed betting limits, and technology has improved the ability to efficiently and accurately monitor betting markets. Right now, the NFL seems safer than ever from a fix; yet, anytime a controversial call affects the final score or point spread, social media lights up with conspiracy theories and accusations of foul play.
Because of this, the NFL also strives to protect the perception of the integrity of the game. Gambling, the league believes, only hurts that perception.
""State-sponsored gambling not only adds to the pressure on our coaches and players, but creates suspicion and cynicism toward every on-the-field mistake that affects the betting line,"" Goodell wrote in a letter to Delaware Gov. Jack Markell in 2009.
McCallum was never convinced that those fears should prevent the Raiders from coming to Las Vegas. Determined to start the conversation, he got his chance before a Broncos-Raiders game on Nov. 9, 2014, at O.Co Stadium in Oakland.
The Raiders were 0-8 and looking for a new stadium deal. McCallum was invited to attend the game as part of the NFL's Salute to Service Weekend, recognizing Veterans Day. He was in charge of lighting the ceremonial eternal flame honoring late Raiders owner Al Davis. Afterward, on the field, he made his case for Las Vegas to Mark Davis.
""I know you're trying to move out of Oakland and are working on the deal to L.A.,"" McCallum said to Davis, ""but have you ever thought about coming to Las Vegas?""
According to McCallum, Davis said that he had considered it and even discussed it informally with Las Vegas mayor Carolyn Goodman, who suggested a potential stadium site out by the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, roughly 12 miles north of downtown. (It was revealed later that Davis had purchased the website domain for LasVegasRaiders.com in 1998).
McCallum didn't like the speedway location and offered an alternative.
""You need to come down to Las Vegas and meet with UNLV,"" he told Davis. ""I think it would be a great partnership there, and I think there's money here to help get this done.""
Davis told McCallum to set up a meeting.
Two months after his on-field chat with Davis, McCallum was back in Las Vegas, sitting in the second row of desks, on the left side of Classroom 220. He was taking an executive development course taught by Bo Bernhard at the UNLV International Gaming Institute.
McCallum and Bernhard had not been formally introduced, and they very nearly weren't on that day either. The course, designed for senior vice presidents and next-generation CEOs in the gaming industry, had a capacity limit of 30. McCallum was the 30th attendee to sign up.
Bernhard began his lecture by holding up an old, black-and-white picture of his great-great grandfather, a charismatic casino worker in the 1940s, who went by Joe ""Kid"" Jordan. He explained how his grandfather was very good as his job, but had to worry only about what took place inside whichever casino he was working for at the time.
""He didn't have to find China on map,"" Bernhard told the class. ""You, as leaders of today, no longer have that luxury.
""Let me give you an illustration,"" he continued, ""the National Football League, for many years, has refused to air commercials for Las Vegas. It has taken a staunch position against gambling, and, in essence, you can sum it up in two ways: 'We're worried about Las Vegas, and we're worried about sports gambling.'
""We now have answers to all of these questions. ... Many of the things the NFL is worried about, not only is Las Vegas not the problem, it could actually be the solution.""
Intrigued, McCallum introduced himself to Bernhard after class. He explained how he had fallen in love with Las Vegas and thought it was a wonderful place to raise his family.
""I also think it's a wonderful place for my team, the Oakland Raiders, to move to,"" McCallum told Bernhard. ""But people always say, 'Good luck convincing the owners and the rest of the NFL that Las Vegas isn't evil and that sports betting isn't evil.' I think I now have the answers to that. Do you want to meet Mark Davis?""
Just weeks after McCallum attended Bernhard's class, Davis arrived discreetly at the International Gaming Institute for that February 2015 meeting. He listened to Bernhard describe what he believed to be the NFL's biggest concerns regarding gambling: corruption, addiction and the sharing of inside information. Bernhard explained how Nevada's regulated sports betting industry approaches those issues.
Davis liked what he heard and asked if the information to be compiled into an academic report.
""Are you kidding?"" Bernhard said with a smile. ""I'm a nerdy academic.""
Bernhard assembled what he described as ""dream team"" of co-authors: a respected Nevada gaming attorney, a state senator and former chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board and a top economic expert on the global gaming industry.
The report, titled ""Professional Team Sports in Las Vegas: What the Research Says,"" is 113 pages long and took nearly a year to prepare. It was funded independently by UNLV and focuses on two primary questions:
• ""Will the presence of legal sports wagering (and gambling more generally) in Nevada lead to integrity issues for a professional league should a team (re-)locate in Las Vegas?
• ""Will operating in Las Vegas lead to unique policing, disciplinary, and/or brand protection issues for a professional league like the NFL?""
They addressed the negatives associated with gambling and acknowledged that the public would likely lose interest in a league featuring games believed to be compromised. ""Given these realities, concerns about integrity are economically justified,"" the report stated.
They examined the sharing of inside information, deriving that ""effective prevention of insider trading requires coordination between sports leagues and betting operators.""
The conclusion was straightforward.
""We conclude (alongside many other observers) that due to the rigor of Nevada's regulatory practices, the state's approach actually provides sports leagues with their best opportunity to protect themselves when it comes to the all-important issue of integrity,"" the report said.
On March 27, 2017, Bernhard was at the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, site of the NFL owners meeting that included the Raiders' relocation vote. He was asked by Badain to be on site in case any gambling questions came up.
Bernhard waited around the hotel, expecting a text message. Nothing ever came. There were no questions regarding sports betting from the owners. Either the UNLV report comforted all the fears or maybe gambling just wasn't as big of a concern as the NFL had made it out to be.
""I wouldn't say (sports gambling) was an out-sized concern,"" said Mark Lipparelli, one of the report's co-authors and a longtime Nevada gaming official and state senator. ""I didn't get that impression. I think [the Raiders] were responsible, careful and open-minded. To me, they were doing the right thing.""
In the end, a $750 million public contribution for a shiny, new stadium was more than enough of a reward for NFL owners to accept any perceived risk from Las Vegas. Owners voted 31-1 in favor of the move.
""Gambling, that is a major concern for us,"" Goodell said at a media conference shortly after last year's vote. ""I think we have to make sure that we continue to stay focused on making sure that everyone has the full confidence that what you see on the field is not influenced by any outside factors. That's our No. 1 concern. That goes to what I consider the integrity of the game, and we will not relent on that.""
Currently, the Supreme Court is reviewing the federal ban on state-sponsored sports betting, and the NFL and other leagues are positioning themselves for the future.
Last week at an NFL owners meeting in Orlando, Florida, the league presented an analysis on the potential impact of sports betting legalization. The findings reportedly came from a study that had been in the works for more than a year and kept under wraps. One source familiar with the league's analysis said it was focused on revenue opportunities, integrity issues and fan reaction, if sports betting becomes legal outside of Nevada.
The NFL said it was unaware of the report that UNLV had produced for the Raiders and declined to comment for this story.
Meanwhile, construction has begun on the new stadium in Las Vegas. Bernhard has a commemorative shovel with the team logo on the spade from the groundbreaking ceremony propped up in a corner of his office. He's just down the hallway from the executive boardroom that hosted the first meeting with Davis and up a flight of stairs from the classroom where he met McCallum.
""I want to be very clear,"" Bernhard said. ""I'm not taking credit for the Raiders. But [the report] was one of those little ripples in the process, and it concludes that, for many of the problems the NFL was concerned about, not only was Las Vegas not the problem, Las Vegas -- and more generally, a regulated gaming industry -- is actually the answer. Or at least, it's better than underground bookies.""
Snyder, the former UNLV president who attended the first meeting, believes Bernhard is being overly humble and describes the report as being an early ""catalyst"" in bringing the Raiders to Las Vegas.
""We're going to look back at this particular time in history as being a transitional moment for the city,"" Snyder said. ""We're a city that was known as the entertainment capital of the world. I think 10 years from now, we're going to look back and see that this was the turning point for it to become the sports entertainment capital of the world. I've said many times that this stadium, over time, will become the most successful stadium in the world.""
It's still a year or two away before the Raiders arrive in Vegas. Aug. 1, 2020, is targeted for completion of the stadium. Bernhard and McCallum, a pair of Las Vegas dads who became friends during the process, each have visions of opening night.
""Someday, Napoleon is going to walk hand-and-hand with his four daughters into that stadium, and I'm going to walk in with my two daughters,"" Bernhard said. ""There will be six daughters and two daddies, and we'll say, 'Your daddies played a little role in all of this.'""
McCallum wants to see local talent on the field before the first game. He'd also like to catch a punt with one hand, like he used to do in past fan appreciation days for the Raiders.
""Then, to top it off, Bruno Mars,"" McCallum said. ""That's how you open a stadium.""

Chiefs TE Travis Kelce shares what Alex Smith being traded to the Redskins means for Patrick Mahomes II next season. (1:53)
In 12 starts as a rookie last season, Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky tossed just seven touchdown passes and registered a 29.2 Total QBR, which ranked 29th in the NFL. It was a severely limited offense under former coordinator Dowell Loggains, and Chicago had one of the league's worst passing offenses.
With new coach Matt Nagy and coordinator Mark Helfrich installing a system that will cater more to the modern quarterback and the Bears adding weapons in free agency, however, Trubisky is in a position to take a major step forward in 2018.
Let's break down why the Bears' new system and personnel upgrades are a boost for Trubisky while also discussing nine more second-year players who can make the leap in 2018.
Here is my list of potential breakout studs -- not rookies who already had stellar 2017 seasons, such as the Saints' Marshon Lattimore and Alvin Kamara -- to keep an eye on:
That 2017 Bears offense didn't scare teams, and Chicago didn't have the targets in the passing game to create stress for opposing secondaries. Load the box and play man coverage. Defenses could keep it simple.
Despite passing for more than 200 yards in just three of those 12 starts, however, Trubisky showed flashes of his athleticism and arm talent. He showed the ability to anticipate throwing windows. And with Nagy & Co. installing a system that will better cater to Trubisky's talent, the arrow is pointing up on the former No. 2 overall pick.
During free agency, the Bears added a top target for Trubisky in wide receiver Allen Robinson, who's a technician in the route tree with the ability to make plays over the top and produce in the red zone. The former Jaguar, who tore an ACL in Week 1 last season, racked up 18 red zone touchdowns from 2015 to 2016. Tight end Trey Burton is the new ""move"" guy in Nagy's offense, a matchup piece who can align in multiple spots. And wide receiver Taylor Gabriel brings some real speed to Chicago with the change-of-direction skills to break down defenses in the open field.
These are major upgrades for Trubisky compared to the lineup he worked with last season, and Nagy's offense -- a modern twist on the West Coast passing game -- should jump-start Trubisky's development. Just look at Jared Goff and the Rams hiring Sean McVay as a potential blueprint.
Mixon entered the league with the most raw talent of the 2017 running back class, in my opinion, with the power, speed and ability to impact the passing game. And we saw those traits pop on the film at times as Mixon rushed for 626 yards and added 287 yards receiving while sharing touches. With veteran Jeremy Hill leaving via free agency and the Bengals making a move to land offensive tackle Cordy Glenn in a trade with Buffalo, Mixon is in line to see an increased workload behind a better offensive line.
Mixon carried the ball 15 times or more in six games and had more than 20 carries in two games. He can handle high-volume touches, and he has the ability to rip off chunk gains on the ground or as a receiving target on screens and underneath throws. After showing some hesitation early in the season when working through the wash to find daylight, he hit the hole with more speed as the season progressed. The upside is there if the Bengals can develop more consistency up front in 2018.
McKinley's energy level jumps out on tape. This guy plays hard on the edge. He's s a relentless pass-rusher who produced six sacks while playing 381 snaps in a rotational role on the Falcons' defensive line.
But when we look ahead to 2018 and the uptick in snaps McKinley should see after defensive end Adrian Clayborn left in free agency, I expect the former UCLA star to elevate his game as a pass-rusher with more technique at the point of attack.
For the majority of edge rushers in the league, that developmental jump comes in their second seasons. With tape to study, and game reps to lean on as teaching tools, this is when we see real growth in counter moves and the ability to set up offensive tackles. McKinley already has displayed the burst to get off the ball -- and his motor never stops. Now, add in the core fundamentals to pair with that 4.59-second 40 speed on the edge? Look out. McKinley is in a spot to boost his profile as one of the top young edge defenders in the NFL.

Limited to just 11 games due to injury, Davis caught 34 passes for 375 yards and didn't reach the end zone during the regular season. If you watch the Week 16 tape against the Rams or take a look at his two touchdown grabs in the divisional-round playoff loss to the Patriots, however, Davis looked much improved. He has the frame (6-foot-3, 209 pounds), body control and big-play talent to produce consistent numbers in 2018 as the Titans transition to new coordinator Matt LaFleur's system.
Davis can run deep in-cuts and win on isolation routes, and he has the footwork to set up defensive backs, as he displayed on this double move to beat Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler for six points. Plus, Tennessee's 2018 offensive system will create more opportunities for Davis, with LaFleur putting quarterback Marcus Mariota in a better position to attack throwing windows. Lots of movement, stack and bunch to get receivers open in the route tree. And with that size at the catch point, Davis should become one of Mariota's top red zone targets.
When free agency opened, the Chiefs surprisingly paid a premium price to land wide receiver Sammy Watkins. But when we look at the Kansas City offensive system under coach Andy Reid, Watkins is yet another weapon -- in an offense loaded at the skill positions -- to build around Mahomes. And the young quarterback brings the big-time arm, the ability to make off-schedule plays and the movement skills that mesh with Reid's playcalling.
Mahomes got one start as a rookie, in Week 17 against the Broncos, completing 22 of 35 passes for 284 yards and an interception. But this is much more about projecting Mahomes' talent base while he's surrounded by a core group of weapons in Watkins, Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce and Kareem Hunt. The Chiefs' creative system will feature the West Coast route tree, play-action, run-pass options and even some QB-designed runs for Mahomes, and he has players around him who will get open.
When the Chiefs traded up to get Mahomes in the 2017 draft and then traded away veteran Alex Smith this offseason, it was easy to see they were going all-in on the Texas Tech product. And the skill set is there, along with the system fit, for Mahomes to play big on the pro stage in his first year as an NFL starter.
After snatching two touchdown catches in Week 1, Golladay battled through injuries and was limited to 11 games as a rookie, finishing with 28 receptions for 477 yards and 3 scores. The NIU product averaged 17.0 yards per catch and produced six receptions of more than 30 yards.
He has the frame (6-4), speed (4.50 40 at the combine) and ball skills to get into the end zone. With new coach Matt Patricia retaining offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter, look for Golladay to settle in as the No. 3 option behind Golden Tate and Marvin Jones in the Lions' three-wide receiver personnel.
King had some up-and-down moments as a rookie. But he has the size/length/speed combo (6-3, 200 pounds) to elevate under new defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, and he already has shown the ability to play press-man coverage and the physicality to challenge routes.
Think more man coverage where King can get up in the grill of opposing wide receivers and track the ball like he did on his college tape at Washington. The talent is there. And so is the toughness. King will play hurt and tackle, and he's a solid fit for Pettine and a Green Bay defensive identity that needs to change after Dom Capers, who had been in charge of the unit since 2009, was fired.
Cohen checked in with 723 yards from scrimmage and three scores in 2017, coming on 87 rushes and 53 catches. But Cohen's electric talent wasn't fully exploited -- he didn't see the consistent touches or scripted matchups I expected to see.
Look for that to change in Nagy's system. Cohen can be the joker in the offensive game plan, a chess piece to expose opposing defenses. Along with his ability as a zone runner, Cohen can be featured on jet sweeps, misdirection plays and screens. He can be flexed out from the formation as a receiver. With a 5-6, 181-pound frame, Cohen can put defenders on skates in the open field.

Due to a Lisfranc injury, Allen played in only five games and had 10 total tackles and a sack. But the former Alabama star showed us glimpses of his athleticism and plus-technique.
Allen has the traits of a veteran when he rushes, showing lane discipline and the hands to win on contact. Plus, as a base defender, he has the strength to battle in the run game. Healthy again, I see a high ceiling for the former No. 17 overall pick heading into his second season as a key piece of the defensive front in Washington.
The fifth-round pick caught 43 passes for 515 yards with two scores as a rookie, but I expect improvement from the former Hawkeye in Year 2. Due to his fit in Kyle Shanahan's offense as a versatile pass-catcher, Kittle could near the 60-catch mark in 2018.
With 4.5 speed, and the formation flexibility to bump into the slot, Kittle has the ability to work the middle of the field, catch the ball off play-action and serve as an inside matchup piece for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Think of Kittle as a ""move"" tight end/H-back who can block in the run game and also slip out of the backfield to give Garoppolo a high-percentage target underneath.

The Baltimore Ravens' first option in finding a backup quarterback is drafting one. The Ravens also could look at practice squad quarterback Josh Woodrum as a replacement for Ryan Mallett.
What if Baltimore fails to take a quarterback in the draft for the fourth straight year or deems Woodrum too big of a risk as the primary backup to Joe Flacco? Would the Ravens ever revisit Colin Kaepernick?
""We’re always trying to make our team better,"" team president Dick Cass said last week at the NFL owners meetings when asked about the possibility of the Ravens considering Kaepernick.
Cass declined to talk further about Kaepernick because of the ongoing collusion lawsuit against the league. Kaepernick should be considered a fallback option at this point, but he would be the best available passer within Baltimore's financial limitations.
A look at the top quarterbacks remaining in free agency (ranked by career passer rating):
Coach John Harbaugh acknowledged that the team's cap space won't allow the Ravens to spend $3 million a year on a backup quarterback, and the franchise expressed interest in Kaepernick last summer, when Flacco's status was uncertain because of a herniated disc. Ravens officials consulted with fans and former and current players, as well as sponsors, about Kaepernick. Ray Lewis said last year that Baltimore was close to signing Kaepernick before the quarterback's girlfriend posted a ""racist"" tweet featuring the Hall of Fame linebacker and owner Steve Bisciotti.
Kaepernick was out of football last season, one year after he drew national attention when he knelt during the national anthem before games as a protest of social injustice, which he said he will no longer do. The Kaepernick issue would be a sensitive one because the Ravens have been dealing with increasing no-shows at their home games, which the team believes is partly due to national anthem protests. Last week, Cass emphasized the need for the organization to do a better job of engaging with fans.
But there are few teams that have more uncertainty at backup quarterback than Baltimore. The Ravens are one of four teams whose current backup quarterback hasn't thrown a pass in the regular season. The New York Giants, Carolina Panthers and Seattle Seahawks are the others.
Kaepernick, 30, can provide experience with what would have to be a prove-it contract. He has declined in each of his past three seasons in the NFL, but his touchdown-to-interception ratio (2.4) since 2012 ranks eighth in the league in that span. He led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2012 and the NFC Championship Game in 2013.
New Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden said last week that he was ""surprised"" Kaepernick hasn't been signed yet.
""He probably will be soon,"" Gruden said.

The Ravens are probably not even close to thinking about Kaepernick right now. Baltimore's options likely are as Harbaugh spelled them out when he was asked how the team will address backup quarterback.
""That will be interesting to see because I don’t know, we don’t know,"" Harbaugh said. ""It could go rookie. It could go Josh Woodrum. It could go veteran.""
The top choice is presumably a rookie draft pick. There has been speculation that Baltimore will take a quarterback as early as the first round, but the more likely scenario is between the third and fifth rounds.
Quarterbacks expected to be taken in the middle rounds include Richmond's Kyle Lauletta, Washington State's Luke Falk and Marshall's Chase Litton. Harbaugh has watched a lot of the quarterbacks in this year's class on film, and he has had his brother, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, look at them as well.
""It's a good group,"" John Harbaugh said. ""There are a lot of quarterbacks deep in the draft, which bodes well. My guess if we have a chance somewhere along the line, we'll get one. There are enough of them. It's not like you're looking at the group and saying, 'I don't think there's anybody there we would like in any given round.' They usually fly off the board, though. So you never know.""
If the Ravens are unable to draft a quarterback, they could look to Woodrum, who starred for the team in the preseason and spent all of last season on Baltimore's practice squad.
Going with Woodrum would be a gamble because of his lack of experience and the importance of this season for the franchise after the team didn't make the playoffs for three straight years. He has never thrown a pass in an NFL regular-season game and has been with six teams since he was signed as an undrafted rookie by the New York Giants in 2016.
""I’m not so sure Josh Woodrum can’t do it,"" Harbaugh said. ""He’ll have to prove it, but he was pretty good last year, and he’s got all the intangibles. I think that’s where it starts, and then we’ll kind of work from there.""
If the Ravens don't draft a quarterback and Woodrum doesn't prove himself, there won't be many choices available. There have been 22 quarterbacks signed in free agency, including the likes of David Fales, Tyler Bray and Matt McGloin.
Would Baltimore take another look at Kaepernick? It's a big question that the Ravens could face months down the road.

Mike Maccagnan is a cool customer. For a guy who drinks 10 cups of coffee a day (no exaggeration), he never seems jittery or rattled. It takes a lot to get a rise out of him, which is why it's noteworthy he displayed a hint of defiance last week when questioned about his sketchy history of drafting quarterbacks -- a hot-button issue in the current landscape.
The New York Jets general manager defended himself by reminding reporters that Bryce Petty was a fourth-round pick (2015) and Christian Hackenberg was a ""late"" second-rounder (2016). It was his way of saying, ""Hey, guys, gimme a break, it's not like I blew a first-round pick."" No, he didn't, but Hackenberg was such a colossal miss -- he still hasn't played in a game -- that some folks are wondering if Maccagnan will get it right on April 26.
""It doesn’t faze me,"" Maccagnan said of the criticism. ""It’s the college draft. [There are] guys you'll hit on and guys who don’t pan out. That’s part of the process. We feel pretty confident with this year’s group and where we're situated.""
The Jets are picking third and, barring the draft upset of the decade, they will select a quarterback from the group of Josh Allen, Sam Darnold, Baker Mayfield and Josh Rosen. It'll be a franchise-altering decision for the Jets and a legacy-defining choice for Maccagnan, a college economics major-turned-scout who found the big chair in 2015. He will attempt to solve The Quarterback Riddle, which has flummoxed this star-crossed franchise for decades.
They've tried everything.
They've rummaged through the recycle bin (Josh McCown and Ryan Fitzpatrick), they've tried their luck in the second round (Hackenberg and Geno Smith) and they've rented a hired gun (Brett Favre). Their last first-round pick was Mark Sanchez in 2009, and that was working for a couple of years -- until it wasn't.
After failing to secure the only quick fix in the 2018 market -- Kirk Cousins said no -- Maccagnan went back to his days as an economics student. He took some of his best assets (three second-round picks, including one in 2019) and sold them off for a chance to score with a potential high-yield investment -- easily the boldest move of his tenure.
The blockbuster trade with the Indianapolis Colts, which allowed the Jets to climb three spots in the draft order, carries considerable risk. It's an all-in move that will leave Maccagnan out of a job in a couple of years if it backfires.

""I don’t like necessarily giving up the picks, per se, to move up,"" said Maccagnan, adding he did it because it's a chance to ""potentially help yourself in the bigger scheme of things.""
ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. called it ""a hefty price to pay,"" saying the Jets essentially gave up three potential starters -- the draft picks that went to the Colts -- to select perhaps the third-best quarterback. In that context, yeah, it doesn't look like a sound move, but no one will remember the compensation if the quarterback develops into a long-term solution.
It's a calculated gamble, but you know what? You can't sit back, passively, and wait for the next Tom Brady in the sixth round. You can't win a Lombardi Trophy by playing it by the book. To quote Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business,"" sometimes you just have to say ... well, you know.
""We do think there are some very good quarterback prospects in this class,"" Maccagnan said. ""They all have different strengths and maybe some different areas of concern or weakness. That’s one of the reasons why I've been to all these pro days, because there are some real viable guys there that you think may be good additions if they fall to us in the right spot.""
The question is, can Maccagnan learn from his past quarterback mistakes?
With Hackenberg, Maccagnan relied too much on projection. The GM saw the big arm and projected what Hackenberg could be, not what he was -- an inaccurate passer with questionable instincts.
Will that effect the way he evaluates Allen, who has a tremendous amount of raw, physical talent but is considered boom or bust?
With Petty, Maccagnan bet on a player from a spread system, figuring he'd need a year or two to make the transition to a pro-style offense. It hasn't happened for Petty, who is 1-6 as a starter.
Will Maccagnan downgrade Mayfield because he played in a spread at Oklahoma?
Hey, no one said this will be an easy decision. History says two of the top four quarterbacks will be NFL disappointments. Maccagnan put himself in the batter's box and gets another swing. Maybe the third time will be the charm.

COSTA MESA, Calif. -- By signing backup quarterback Geno Smith to a one-year deal on Sunday, the Los Angeles Chargers put Cardale Jones on notice that he will have competition for the No. 2 quarterback job during training camp.
""He's a very young player,"" coach Anthony Lynn said about Jones at the NFL scouting combine. ""People forget this guy never lost a college football game. He's 6-foot-5, 260, can move around pretty well and has a strong arm.
""Every day in practice he makes throws that make you shake your head. He's a highly intelligent young man. There's no reason why he couldn't be our future quarterback.""
The addition of Smith doesn't mean the Chargers won't select a quarterback in this year's draft. General manager Tom Telesco and the rest of his staff have been doing extensive work on this year's quarterback class.
The Chargers met with Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield before his pro day and met with Lamar Jackson after his pro day. Lynn attended the pro days of Sam Darnold and Josh Rosen, too.
Telesco also watched Mayfield, Darnold, Rosen and Oklahoma State's Mason Rudolph play in person last season.
In Smith, the Chargers bring in a player who Lynn is familiar with and who fits his desire to have a mobile quarterback who can threaten the defense with his legs.
""When you have a guy who can move around a little bit like Lamar, you make a defense play 11-on-11,"" Lynn said about Jackson at the combine. ""And sometimes, they think that's not fair. But when the offense can go 11-on-11, that's a defensive coordinator's worst nightmare. That's what he brings to the table.""
Lynn spent two seasons with Smith during the 2013 and 2014 campaign when he served as running backs coach for the New York Jets.
Smith backed up Eli Manning last season. He started Dec. 3 when Manning was benched for a week. Manning had been the NFL's active leader in consecutive starts at 210.

Smith was solid, completing 21 of 34 passes for 212 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions in a 24-17 loss to the Oakland Raiders.
At 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds, the 27-year-old Smith adds another quarterback to the mix of players competing for a spot on the roster and perhaps serving as an eventual replacement for Philip Rivers.
A 2013 second-round selection by the Jets, Smith never lived up to lofty expectations during his four seasons with the team.
Smith had his share of issues with the Jets. Smith was sucker-punched by linebacker IK Enemkpali, forcing him to spend time on the injured reserve, and he also lost the starting job to Ryan Fitzpatrick in 2015.
And Smith was benched against the Chargers in 2014 because he missed a meeting the day before the game. He got the meeting time mixed up because they were on the West Coast. Michael Vick started, and the Chargers rolled 31-0.
However, the physical tools are still present for the talented quarterback from West Virginia, and the Chargers provide Smith another opportunity to prove his worth in the league. For his career, Smith has competed 58 percent of his passes, throwing for 6,174 yards, with 29 touchdowns and 36 interceptions.
The addition of Smith to the quarterback room likely means Rivers' good friend Kellen Clemens, who served as the backup quarterback for four seasons, will not return.
And along with Jones, Smith likely will have additional competition in the quarterback room from this year's draft. The Chargers have not selected a quarterback in the draft during Telesco's tenure since drafting Brad Sorensen in the seventh round of the 2013 draft.

Johnny Manziel tells Jordan Rodgers that he's trying to focus on his daily regimen as he works out at Texas A&M's pro day. (2:04)
This is the window. Now is Johnny Manziel's best chance -- as slim as it might be -- to catch the eye of an NFL team before deciding whether to circle back and make a two-year commitment to play in the CFL.
The process began last week, when Manziel jumped into the University of San Diego's pro day attended by scouts from 13 NFL teams. It will accelerate on Wednesday as he joins the Spring League, a developmental program that runs March 28 through April 15 in Austin, Texas, with games staged on April 7 and 12 -- Manziel's first since starting for the Cleveland Browns on Dec. 27, 2015.
Manziel said last week ""there's still people that still doubt what I'm doing and still doubt where I'm at"" -- an acknowledgement of his extensive list of off-field indiscretions. He won't resolve all of those questions over a two-week minor league experience, but the stint will help him address a more tangible issue: How far, if at all, did he deteriorate physically during what he admits were long stretches of substance abuse?
There is no precedent for a quarterback returning from two years away to earn a starting job in his first season back. There have been only six cases since the 1970 merger in which a quarterback has started eight-plus games in a season after not playing in an NFL game over the prior two-plus seasons, according to the Elias Sports Bureau research, and each were either on a roster or played in the CFL in the interim:
And fair or not, NFL teams have recently demonstrated a resistance toward investing in backup quarterbacks who they believe will draw public attention.
The league itself has also changed dramatically since Manziel was last a part of it. More than half of teams (17) hired new head coaches in those two seasons. There are also 14 new general managers, 27 new offensive coordinators and 14 teams with new starting quarterbacks. A total of 65 quarterbacks have started at least one game since the end of the 2015 season.
If no NFL teams express interest based on his performances in the Spring League, however, Manziel would still have time to join a CFL team before the start of the league's training camp in May. His rights continue to be owned by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, whose season begins June 16 and whose coach -- former Hawaii and SMU coach June Jones -- has said Manziel would be ""the best player to ever play up here.""
CFL rookies typically must sign contracts that bind them to the league for two seasons. Unless his CFL team grants a rare waiver, Manziel wouldn't be eligible to return to the NFL before November 2019 -- or, more realistically, the 2020 NFL season.
""If something [with the NFL] pops up, it pops up. And if not, if I don't get the opportunity to go back, I'm going to go play in the CFL, and things are going to be fine,"" Manziel said at Texas A&M's pro day on Tuesday. ""One way or another, one day down the line, I'll get back to exactly where I want to be, because I'm not going to stop until I do.""
How did the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner (and 2014 first-round draft choice) fall this far? Let's take a closer look at the 800-plus days since Manziel last played in the NFL.
January 2015: In Week 17 of the 2015 season, Manziel visits Las Vegas, wearing a wig to hide his identity, and misses a mandatory concussion treatment on the morning of the Browns' final game. In an interview with Uninterrupted's ""The ThomaHawk Show"" podcast last month, Manziel says: ""What a complete lack of respect for an organization that was trying to stick by me,"" he says.

Exploring hot topics around the New England Patriots in mailbag form:
Mike what r your thoughts on a guy like Manziel? Bill's done a very good job of keeping things under control distractions like with Tebow & Hernandez don't become a circus.He's only 25 still young from QB standpoint and could really learn a lot from Brady and Josh. Cheap deal too
— Jesse V (@Patswillwinit) March 30, 2018
Jesse, I wrote on the reasons I could see the Patriots signing quarterback Johnny Manziel, and the reasons I think they might shy away from it, last week. Here is that piece. The more I've thought about it, I wouldn't be surprised if it happens, with one huge caveat: The team would have to be at a high comfort level with him off the field as it relates to allegations of domestic violence (a 2016 domestic violence charge was dismissed). If there is a high comfort level by the Patriots with that, I see limited risk for the team in bringing Manziel aboard at a time when there are 90 players on the roster and there is still a need for a third/developmental quarterback. At the least, Manziel could be part of the offseason program, he'd be on a minimum-level contract, and who knows if he would even make it to training camp? But it wouldn't hurt to take a closer look at him on a day-to-day basis in the offseason program to determine if there was something there to work with further. It could potentially provide an insurance policy if the Patriots decide not to draft a quarterback (or if the quarterback they like doesn't make it to them). Furthermore, while I don't think this is the main reason to do it, I also believe the presence of a once highly touted player who has hit rock bottom and is trying to work his way back can also potentially have a positive trickle-down effect on others.
Hey Mike, good article overall. I agree with the grade of a B. I really like the Shleton and Clayborn additions. You mentioned LB as a need in the draft which I agree with. But don't you think the team still needs a top end pass rusher still? Clayborn is more of a rotation piece.
— Mike's On (@TheMikeIsOn) March 30, 2018
The way I view the pass-rushers/end-of-the-line players in the scheme is that the Patriots have had some notable success when they've had a solid rotation. In 2016, for example, the foursome of Rob Ninkovich, Chris Long, Jabaal Sheard and Trey Flowers was more than capable. They didn't have that last year, in part due to some personnel decisions that didn't work out. In 2018, Flowers and Adrian Clayborn are part of that mix, and Deatrich Wise Jr. could develop into even more of a contributor. I'm curious to see where 2017 third-round pick Derek Rivers (who missed his rookie season with a torn ACL) fits as well, as rushing the passer was his forte at Youngstown State, where he set the school record with 41 sacks. There are some other potential developmental players as well, such as Keionta Davis, who will get a look in camp. So while they could always add another piece there, the development of the younger players will also be key.
Which position should Patriots strengthen with priority?QB(find successor)? TE(still use D-Allen)? RB(satisfied with Jeremy Hill)?O-line(need to protect Brady)? LB(If we miss Hightower again...)?CB(left Butler and Bademosi)?anything else?
— 森川 (@jwoodsriver) March 30, 2018
If I had to make a list of priorities, assuming everything was equal, it would look like this: a franchise-caliber left tackle, an off-the-line linebacker who runs well and could factor on all three downs, and a developmental quarterback would be my top three. A lot depends on how the draft unfolds, and they could never go wrong with adding more speed at running back, another defensive back, a pass-rusher or a tight end, but those first three pieces are the ones that stand out to me the most.
Still no defensive coordinator? Belichick making all the defense draft decisions too? Wow!
— Amin Pashapour (@apashapour) March 29, 2018
Amin, the Patriots are going to have linebackers coach Brian Flores run the defense, but without the title of coordinator. That is similar to how the team did it with Matt Patricia, Bill O'Brien and Josh McDaniels in years past. As Bill Belichick said, there might be an addition or two to the defensive staff in the future.
Hey @MikeReiss - I don't understand this ""Robert Kraft the fan"" approach. He's the owner whether he says he's thinking as a fan or not. Isn't he still sending a message as an owner?
— Shimon Cohen, LCSW (@ShimonDCohen) March 28, 2018
Shimon, when Robert Kraft references ""putting his fan hat on,"" I take that to mean when he reacts with emotion about a decision. Then when he steps outside of that, and looks at things from an owner's perspective, it's less about emotion and more about management skills and supporting the people he's put in place to make challenging decisions, knowing they are doing so with more information than fans. That doesn't necessarily mean he won't challenge them on things. So in essence, it's his way of taking the emotion out of the equation and being able to separate and look at the big picture.
@MikeReiss Hey Mike, Happy Easter. You see them bringing Harrison back? I'm sure they will see how the draft goes. Nice insurance policy to have.
— Paul Savini (@PaulSavini) March 30, 2018
Paul, this has been a frequent question in recent weeks, specific to James Harrison. My sense is that if it happens, it would be later in the process. I don't sense urgency from either side to push something through right now.
Mike, do you think this is an effort to achieve more parity? Have to believe this hurts good teams making playoff runs, it's a potentially major distraction and could allow for significant outside influence on a playoff team's activities
— Mike Richardson (@mrichardson31) March 27, 2018
Mike, the NFL was considering a rule to allow assistants to sign contracts with other teams to become head coach in an attempt to protect teams who stop their coaching search thinking they have it completed, only to have the coach back out. The feeling among some is that it is a bad look for the league when that happens. Don Banks of Patriots.com wrote on this last week and shared the perspective of some NFL folks.

PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers started free agency strapped for cash (around $6.5 million in cap space) but looking to improve. While most of their needs were met on offense, the loss of linebacker Ryan Shazier to a spinal injury and the release of safety Mike Mitchell created two glaring holes that only one first-round pick can solve.
Two weeks later, as Steelers officials rolled through the halls of the Ritz-Carlton Grande Lakes in Orlando, Florida, for the NFL owners meetings, they were satisfied with the additions of linebacker Jon Bostic and safety Morgan Burnett and teasing more moves thanks to more than $3 million in leftover space.
""I wouldn’t say we’re done with free agency, because stuff changes,"" said general manager Kevin Colbert, citing the need to be ready if talented players become available via release.
Here's how the Steelers filled out their defense with minimal money:
Patience in linebacker/safety markets: The Steelers showed interest in many free-agent inside linebackers early in the process, including Denver's Todd Davis and Cincinnati's Preston Brown. But as several linebackers earned deals worth $5 million to $9 million per year, some of whom are considered two-down players, the Steelers decided they couldn't spend that much.
Enter Bostic, who wasn't a splashy free agent because of injuries and mostly backup production in his first three seasons. But getting a player fresh off a 97-tackle season for two years and $4 million made sense to the Steelers.
Once they secured Bostic, they circled back with Burnett, whom they had called the week before. Tyrann Mathieu's signing for one year and $7 million with the Houston Texans signaled a weak safety market. The Steelers took advantage.
""We just let it play out,"" Colbert said about their free-agency approach. ""We knew when we looked at the market we knew that we were only going to be able to do certain things within our own limitations, again, after we made the reductions on our own roster. So as the market unfolds we reacted to it and we were happy to get Burnett and John Bostic from the picks.""

Kirk Cousins. Jimmy Graham. Andrew Norwell. This class is already wild. Here's everything to know.
• Barnwell's free agency & trade grades »
• Signings, analysis for all 32 teams »
• Ranking top 100 NFL free agents »
• Players who landed in perfect spots »
• Highest-paid players at every position »
• Who really got best free-agent deals? »
• Biggest remaining need for all 32 »
• Are Vikings NFC fave with Cousins? »
• Fantasy impact of key deals, moves »
Sensible contracts: Burnett's $14.35 million deal over three years seems hefty for a cash-strapped team, but the structure of the contract works for Pittsburgh. The signing bonus of $4.25 million spread over three years, coupled with a $1 million base salary in Year 1, equals a modest $2.416 million cap hit in 2018. That leaves nearly $10 million of salary on the final two years, but those are not guaranteed.
Add Bostic's $1.5 million cap hit and the Steelers just got two starters for less than $4 million this year.
""We obviously had to make some cap adjustments to get in compliance, and in doing that we had to look at all alternatives,"" Colbert said. ""Fortunately, there was a guy available to us we felt was a good alternative, and Morgan Burnett, he was affordable. And again, we were able to get the deal done with both sides being agreeable.""
No star power, but flexibility: For a team not spending big, the best course is getting positional options in the second wave of free agency. The Steelers typically prefer this process, knowing they can walk away from any deal after Year 1 with minimal recourse.
But Burnett was one of the top safeties available because of his hybrid ability. He can play slot corner, dime linebacker or both safety spots. Bostic might have lost a step but has adequate speed (4.61 40 at the 2013 combine). He should be able to help cover running backs in the flat.
""They’re capable veteran players who are solid guys, guys that we had knowledge of in terms of how they entered the league,"" coach Mike Tomlin said. ""We researched those guys when they came into the league, so it made the research of them in the free-agency market a less daunting task. So, we’re excited about having those guys. We’re excited to get them in, but we’re also excited about the experience and expertise that they’re going to bring as well.""

The Texans add a playmaker on defense and the Broncos pin their offensive hopes on a new quarterback as both teams move up in the latest NFL Nation Power Rankings. (1:27)
There has been no shortage of movement this offseason, and now it's time to make some sense of it.
The ESPN power panel -- a group of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities -- evaluates how the NFL stacks up following the initial surge of free agency. (Hint: The league has shifted quite a bit since our way-too-early edition.)
Note: These are based on which teams would win head-to-head. Higher-ranked teams would be favored against lower-ranked teams. ESPN Stats & Information's John McTigue contributed the following.

One of the reigning champs' biggest strengths was the defensive line, which featured a league-high seven players with at least 400 snaps last season.

One of the Patriots' biggest weaknesses last season was their front seven, allowing the second-most yards per rush and the most time to throw on passes. They've traded for Danny Shelton and signed Adrian Clayborn, who had 9.5 sacks in 2017, to bolster the defensive front.

The 2018 offseason will be defined by the signing of Kirk Cousins. Consider this for a moment: The Vikings have been around since 1961, and they've never had a quarterback throw for at least 20 touchdowns in three consecutive seasons. Cousins has thrown at least 25 touchdown passes in three consecutive seasons.
2017 record: 11-5
Way-too-early ranking: 6
Drew Brees re-signing for two years is the best news for the Saints this offseason, but they've also added pieces to their resurgent defense. Demario Davis, Alex Okafor and Patrick Robinson all join a defense that allowed eight fewer points per game in 2017 than in 2016.

The biggest question for the Steelers is whether they can work out a long-term deal with Le'Veon Bell, who was once again franchised. Bell has accounted for 75 percent of the Steelers' rushing yards over the past two seasons, the only player to surpass 70 percent.
2017 record: 11-5
Way-too-early ranking: 9
The Rams had one of the biggest offensive turnarounds in NFL history last season. This offseason the Rams are adding 12 Pro Bowls between Ndamukong Suh, Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib to a defense that already featured the 2017 Defensive Player of the Year, Aaron Donald.
2017 record: 10-6

The Falcons filled a big need by signing guard Brandon Fusco to bulk up the interior of the offensive line. The defensive line has taken a hit, though, with Dontari Poe and Adrian Clayborn both signing elsewhere. The duo played the second- and third-most snaps along Atlanta's defensive line last season.
2017 record: 10-6
Way-too-early ranking: 5
The Jaguars saw a huge turnaround in 2017 and are continuing to build on that success. No team ran more between the tackles in 2017, so they signed an All-Pro guard in Andrew Norwell to help. No team had fewer receptions at tight end last season, so they signed Austin Seferian-Jenkins to fix that.
2017 record: 7-9
Way-too-early ranking: 8
The splashy signing of Jimmy Graham will certainly shore up a tight end group that combined for two touchdowns last season, tied for fewest in the NFL. But that move didn't come without sacrifice, and how will Aaron Rodgers react without his old favorite target? Rodgers has thrown more touchdown passes to Jordy Nelson in his career than any other player (65).
2017 record: 4-12
Way-too-early ranking: 15
The Texans allowed the most points in the NFL in 2017, so plugging gaps on the defense was crucial. Tyrann Mathieu, who leads all players in interceptions when lining up as a slot corner the past five seasons, and Aaron Colvin, who was the slot corner on the Jaguars' stout defense last season, are good starts.
2017 record: 6-10
Way-too-early ranking: 14
Only the Packers allowed a higher Total QBR on passes to wide receivers than the Niners did last season, so the addition of Richard Sherman should pay immediate dividends. With a huge defensive need addressed and Jimmy Garoppolo locked in, San Francisco is in good shape heading into the draft.
2017 record: 11-5
Way-too-early ranking: 10
The Panthers were able to mitigate the loss of defensive tackle Star Lotulelei by bringing in Dontari Poe, but the Panthers haven't done much to mitigate the loss of All-Pro guard Andrew Norwell yet. The Panthers already ranked 24th in yards per rush between the tackles last season, so losing Norwell won't help.
2017 record: 9-7

The Seahawks ranked 13th in points allowed last season, the first time since 2011 they ranked outside the top three. With Richard Sherman, Michael Bennett, Sheldon Richardson, DeShawn Shead and Jeremy Lane all gone -- and more changes potentially coming -- it's possible Seattle could slip even further.
2017 record: 10-6

The Chiefs made a big splash in acquiring Sammy Watkins for new starter Patrick Mahomes, but the defense has seen better days. Marcus Peters, Derrick Johnson, Tamba Hali, Ron Parker and Terrance Mitchell are all gone, and all have been big contributors in recent years.

It had been a relatively quiet offseason for the Chargers, but they recently swooped in to secure three-time Pro Bowler Mike Pouncey after he was released by the Dolphins. Los Angeles ranked 27th in average rushing yards before contact last season.

Way-too-early ranking: 17
Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel is now the head coach. Former Patriots running back Dion Lewis and former Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler are the highlight of Tennessee's free-agent class.

2017 record: 9-7
Way-too-early ranking: 13
Ultimately franchising DeMarcus Lawrence and tendering David Irving will likely be looked back on as the biggest moves for Dallas this offseason. The duo accounted for 57 percent of the Cowboys' sacks last season, the third highest of any pair in the NFL.
2017 record: 9-7
Way-too-early ranking: 20
The Lions ranked 27th in total defense last season but there will be a lot of new faces on Detroit's defense in 2018. Gone are Haloti Ngata, D.J. Hayden, Tahir Whitehead, and in are Sylvester Williams, DeShawn Shead and Christian Jones.
2017 record: 5-11
Way-too-early ranking: 23
The Broncos ranked 30th in team Total QBR last season, so they went out and got the quarterback who finished second among QBs in 2017. If Case Keenum can provide some stability to the position, Denver could find itself back in contention.
2017 record: 7-9
Way-too-early ranking: 22
Kirk Cousins is on to Minnesota and Alex Smith is in for Washington. Will there be much of a difference? Over the past three seasons they have near identical Total QBRs -- 62 for Cousins and 61 for Smith. Cousins has thrown for 20 more touchdowns, but Smith has thrown 16 fewer interceptions over the same span.

Baltimore's wide receivers made little impact last season, catching 55 percent of targets (29th), dropping 5.6 percent (29th) and recording 2.9 yards after the catch (last).

December 5, is the one year anniversary of Klay Thompson's 60-point performance. Check out some of the best moments from the game. (1:18)
Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson slept through practice the day before scoring a career-high 60 points in a 2016 game, according Kevin Durant.
Thompson's performance came during a 142-106 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Dec. 5, 2016.
""Oh, so like the [day] before he had 60, Klay just missed practice. He didn't come,"" Durant said on the Bill Simmons podcast. ""He just ... nobody like, you know when practice starts, it was like, 'Where the hell is Klay?' We called him, called him, called him. He didn't come to practice. He just like, just didn't come. And the next night he had 60.""
""You still don't know what happened?"" Simmons asked.
""Don't know what happened. I think he said, like, 'Man, I was an hour late, two hours late. I was like, I might as well just stay in bed.' And he came out and had 60. I was like, this guy, if everybody in the world was like Klay the universe would be better,"" Durant said.
Thompson didn't play in the fourth quarter after scoring 40 points in the first half and another 20 in the third quarter.
It was the first 60-point game for the franchise since Rick Barry scored 64 versus the Portland Trail Blazers on March 26, 1974.

Mike Golic and Trey Wingo react to LeBron James' UNINTERRUPTED company issuing a letter over copyright infringement to Alabama. (1:58)
Cleveland Cavaliers All-Star LeBron James has an issue with University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban. It's not over something Saban said, however, but the vehicle he used to say it.
Last week, the official Twitter account for Alabama football released a trailer for ""Shop Talk,"" with Alabama alumnus Julio Jones joining Saban and other football players for an off-the-cuff roundtable discussion in a barbershop setting.

James, on his multimedia platform UNINTERRUPTED, has previously released two installments of the web series ""The Shop"" and filmed a third, featuring the Cavs star with friends, business associates, and sports and pop culture figures having free-flowing conversations while getting haircuts.

On Monday, UNINTERRUPTED sent a letter to Alabama addressing concerns over copyright infringement and intellectual property appropriation.
""The Shop"" was developed by James and UNINTERRUPTED co-founder Maverick Carter. Its first episode, which premiered during the 2017 NBA Finals, generated approximately 4 million views across UNINTERRUPTED.com and ESPN's YouTube channel, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ESPN.
""Your continued exploitation of 'Shop Talk' infringes 'UNINTERRUPTED's' copyright, trademark rights and other valuable intellectual property rights in 'The Shop' and significantly damages 'UNINTERRUPTED's' commercial prospects for 'The Shop,'"" the letter reads, in part.
The letter goes on to invite a conversation with Alabama before ""rushing into legal proceedings.""
The Crimson Tide, winners of two of the past three national championships with Saban at the helm, opened a barbershop in the football team's Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility in February and named it Bama Cuts.
Alabama's associate vice president for communications, Monica Watts, issued a statement to ESPN late Monday afternoon:

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra speaks to the media about Hassan Whiteside's critical comments about 4th-quarter playing time. (1:15)
Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra told reporters Monday that he met with Hassan Whiteside to discuss the center's rant after Saturday's game and that the team is ""moving on.""
The Heat fined Whiteside an undisclosed amount Sunday for ""comments detrimental to the team"" after Miami's 110-109 overtime loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday. Whiteside had questioned the Heat's decision to match the Nets when they went to a small lineup, when ""we've got one of the best centers in the league.""
""It's behind us,"" Spoelstra said Monday, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. ""You can tell right now by the mood of the gym that's long gone. The only reason we're addressing out of obligation to all of you because it really is a team matter, a family matter. We're focused on getting the next one and securing our spot in this dance.""
Spoelstra did note he was disappointed that Whiteside chose to make his displeasure public rather than handling it as a team, calling it ""poor timing"" and ""poor judgment.""
""Guys want to throw a few eggs after the game or TP my house, that's actually a better way to deal with it than speaking to [the media] about the frustrations,"" Spoelstra said.
Whiteside didn't play in the final 21 minutes Saturday -- the last four of the third quarter then all of the fourth quarter and overtime -- after both teams went small.
""A lot of teams don't have a good center,"" Whiteside said. ""They are going to use their strengths. It's bulls---. It's really bulls---, man. There are a lot of teams that can use a center.""
Whiteside on Monday chalked up his expletive-filled rant to frustration.
""I was just frustrated, man,"" Whiteside said. ""I was frustrated that we lost. I really wanted to get that game. ... I could have handled it different. But I got so caught up in wanting to get that win. I get real competitive. I really want to be out there. But I just trust coach's decision.""
Whiteside, who has missed 29 games this season because of injury, has seen his playing time average decrease to 25 minutes per game in 2017-18, down from 29.1 minutes in 2016-17, when he finished as the league's leading rebounder. The previous two seasons, he averaged 32.6 minutes.
Saturday's game was the second for Whiteside in his return to the court after missing the previous nine games with a hip injury. He said he was pleased with how he felt after Monday's practice.
""I feel great,"" Whiteside said. ""We had a great practice. I'll leave it up to the coaching staff's hands.""
Spoelstra insisted that Whiteside's role was not in question.
""It has nothing to do with the role,"" the Heat coach said. ""He knows exactly what's expected of him as he continues to get back in shape. He knows what I want out of him and what his teammates want out of him. He'll continue to work to get back in shape, and we'll get him back to where he was before he got hurt about 3 ½ weeks ago.""
The Heat can clinch their 20th playoff spot in 30 seasons with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday.
If healthy, on the floor and in form, Whiteside will play a significant role for the Heat in a playoff run.
""He can help us a lot,"" Dwyane Wade said. ""Obviously he's got to continue to get in game shape like all of us that come back from injuries because you've got to get confident in your body, so that takes a little while, but when he's into it, he's one of the most dominant centers in the game.""

WALTHAM, Mass. -- Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward has begun light on-court jogging in the latest step in his recovery from the fractured ankle he suffered on opening night.
The Players' Tribune posted a video Monday showing Hayward jogging alongside trainer Jason Smeathers at Boston's practice facility.
Get Ready... 3... 2... 1...@GordonHayward pic.twitter.com/ZZDMthH3n4
— The Players' Tribune (@PlayersTribune) April 2, 2018
Smeathers noted it was Hayward's first on-court run since the injury when he tweeted: ""Doing some pace setting for [Hayward] for the first jog back on the court.""
Hayward had been running on the team's alter-G anti-gravity treadmill and slowly ramping himself up to a level where he could be cleared to begin running on his full bodyweight.
Celtics coach Brad Stevens stressed that Hayward is still a ""long, long way away"" from basketball activities and reaffirmed that he's not playing this season.
""I saw that video. It's pretty slow running,"" Stevens said. ""I was up there watching it the other morning when they [filmed] that. The next step of his progression is once every three days he gets on the court and does that. So as you can see it was about 20 percent speed, nothing lateral, no jumping. So a long, long way away.
""We've said it before: We can talk about the videos. He's not playing. But he might travel [with the team], and maybe we'll list him as something.""
Stevens said that Hayward won't travel with Boston on its upcoming two-game trip to Milwaukee and Toronto but left open the possibility of joining the team for the final regular-season road game in Washington.
Stevens did acknowledge that jogging is an encouraging step forward for Hayward.
""I think every day where he can accomplish something new is a big deal,"" said Stevens. ""He's in here six days a week. He gets one off day a week where he gets to rest it and still gets treatment on it and everything else. But everything else, he gets those small accomplishments, and those are a big deal when you're rehabbing.""
Hayward has remained steadfast that he's simply taking his progress day-by-day and would not rule himself out for the season.
Boston (53-23) entered Monday second in the Eastern Conference standings with six games remaining in the regular season.
""The hope is still there,"" Hayward said last month. ""It's something where I'm really honestly not even thinking about it. I know we're getting toward the end of the year, it's something that I'm still working toward but if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.""
Celtics swingman Jaylen Brown hadn't seen Hayward running yet but said he knows his teammate is eager to get on the court.
""It's good to see him back. He's going to continue to get better and I know the one thing he wants to do is get out there and play basketball right now,"" Brown said. ""As an athlete, as a competitor, that's one thing you want. Just me being out for two weeks, when I had a concussion for a little bit, I was itching. I just felt withdrawal from the basketball court so not being able to play, I'm sure he's experiencing that as well. So I'm happy for him and it's a blessing that you can see he's back on his feet, he's running, and he's seeing it with his own two eyes. And just to hear that is really good news.""
Hayward also recently posted a video of him making a 3-pointer while lying down beyond the arc. Stevens was playfully asked if he could incorporate that into an after-timeout play.
""If he can figure out a way to defend on his back,"" cracked Stevens.

CAMDEN, N.J. -- The Philadelphia 76ers are paying tribute to Hall of Famer Julius Erving.
The NBA team will unveil a sculpture of Erving during a ceremony Tuesday at their practice facility in Camden, New Jersey. It will be the sixth sculpture installed on 76ers Legends Walk, joining statues of other team greats, including Wilt Chamberlain and Billy Cunningham.
More commonly known as ""Dr. J,"" Erving was a two-time NBA MVP and an 11-time All-Star who led the 76ers to the 1983 NBA title. He played 16 seasons overall in the NBA and ABA.
The 76ers retired his No. 6 jersey in 1988. He was honored as one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996.

During Final Four weekend, the NCAA, NBA and USA Basketball joined forces to bring together 66 prospects from around the world for two days of practices and scrimmages, one of which was open to pro scouts and college coaching staffs. The Next Generation program, a new venture funded by the NBA and NCAA, was the first time these three organizations have formally cooperated to put on a youth basketball event.
The partnership comes at a fascinating time for the future of the game. College basketball is engulfed in an ongoing FBI investigation. The NBA is ready to get involved with elite high school prospects again as it develops players overseas at the NBA academies. And most of the best American players continue to make their way through USA Basketball, including Darius Bazley, a top-10 high school recruit who decommitted from Syracuse last week to forgo college and play in the G League.
What's at stake for each organization, and what it could mean moving forward?
USA Basketball
For USA Basketball, this was a free look -- via all-expense paid trips courtesy of the NCAA -- at 21 domestic players, allowing program directors and coaching staffs to get a head start on what promises to be a busy summer ahead, with the FIBA under-17 World Cup, and the FIBA Americas under-18 Championship in June.Editor's PicksNBA mock draft: New lottery picks heading into Sweet 16How has the shape of the NBA draft changed with many of the top prospects out of the NCAA tournament?

How has the shape of the NBA draft changed with many of the top prospects out of the NCAA tournament? Jonathan Givony breaks down the new picks in both rounds.
Who are the best prospects in the 2018 NBA draft? You can find our updated top 100 rankings here throughout the season.
A number of new USA Basketball players were invited to showcase their talent and willingness to take instruction in practices and scrimmages against the international teams, giving them a taste of what they can expect at the training camps leading up to the official competitions.
The atmosphere was highly competitive, with a huge emphasis placed on the core of USA Basketball's identity and recipe for success: defense, ball-movement, intensity and transition scoring. Culture, accountability and expectations are the words you constantly hear from everyone involved with USA Basketball, and every opportunity to connect with America's most talented athletes is another chance for them to instill those values.
The NBA
This was an invaluable opportunity for the NBA to get 45 young international academy members exposure in front of college and pro team decision-makers. It also served as an important development tool, as players were pitted against some of the most physically gifted and talented competition they've ever faced in the form of USA Basketball's elite high school prospects.
One of the bigger challenges facing the NBA Academy -- still in its inaugural year -- is the lack of consistent competitive games, since the teams aren't part of any official domestic leagues. This was also a chance to introduce the academy players to the world of college basketball at its most glamorous. Few, if any, of the academy members are ready to make the jump to the NBA or even the G League, and the NCAA is undoubtedly a viable path for many considering the added benefit of receiving an education while continuing to develop as basketball players.
The NCAA
Beyond earning goodwill, the NCAA's goals in contributing to such an ambitious endeavor are not quite as obvious at first glance, though it makes sense when digging deeper. With more alternatives to Division I, there is clearly value in being able to connect with many of the best American high school players and continuing to solidify its relationship with USA Basketball.
Plus, the NBA academies will likely become a fruitful pathway in the coming years for internationals looking to play college basketball. Making sure these players are aware of the steps involved in recruiting and becoming eligible is a process that is already underway. This is perhaps a necessary move for the NCAA to ensure its stays viable in an ever-changing environment that has been rocked by the ongoing FBI investigation over the past six months.
What's next?
All three organizations participating in this event are facing existential questions about their place in the assembly line of basketball player talent development. Who controls it? At what age does each group need to jump in to ensure the players' best interests, as well as their own, are represented? A massive void opened up with sneaker companies Adidas and Under Armour taking a step back from the grassroots basketball world, and each of these organizations needs to decide how it want to proceed moving forward.
The discussion about the NBA's one-and-done rule along with Bazley's decision made for an interesting backdrop to this event and led to plenty of spirited conversations over the course of the weekend about the future of college basketball.
Despite the scandal, college basketball remains the most consistently reliable pathway for high school players to develop into professional prospects. Virtually every NBA executive we've spoken with over the past few months remains steadfast in their insistence that the status quo is perfectly acceptable from their standpoint, and there will undoubtedly be pushback from teams if the NBA attempts to eliminate the one-and-done rule.
Most NBA executives we spoke with feel that Bazley is making a mistake by attempting to enter the NBA via the G League, as he's far too physically underdeveloped to hold his own against players in their mid-20s, and he will likely become a nightly target for opponents. A concern also exists among G League officials that if Bazley struggles then it could be difficult to recruit future high schoolers down the road when the league is better prepared to handle players in his mold.

Kelly Oubre Jr. gives an exclusive look at his shoe collection. (3:13)
""This is the most expensive jacket I've ever bought in my life,"" Kelly Oubre said as he sat down on a couch in his apartment building in Washington, D.C.
Oubre was sporting a $4,500 coat from Kith -- a stark contrast to the outerwear he was wearing earlier that afternoon, a $40 jacket from Urban Outfitters.
Kelly Oubre tells the story of how he bought his most expensive jacket.
For the Washington Wizards' sixth man, fashion is not about dressing up to make other people think you're fashionable. It's about feeling good.
""I just create the wave,"" Oubre said. ""I don't really follow anything. ... I don't get any inspiration from anywhere. It's just what comes from inside.""
Kelly Oubre discusses the outfit he wore to New York Fashion Week.
In his three years in the league, especially this year, Oubre's pregame outfits have become a sight to see.
""I prioritize basketball first,"" Oubre said, ""but when I can go and do some things that have to do with fashion, which I love, I go do it.""
Originally from New Orleans, Oubre has embraced East Coast fashion. He said he doesn't do a ton of shopping, but when he does, he often shops online. While he has his fair share of designer clothing (and accessories, including a Rolex and prescription Cartier glasses), Oubre prefers thrift shopping.
Two of his favorite outfits represent that ideology -- the Urban Outfitters jacket and a black ""Wave"" inscripted jacket his girlfriend made for him.
Kelly Oubre shows off his seemingly expensive outfit -- but it's thrown off by his $40 jacket.
Oubre shows off the inside of one of his favorite jackets, and reveals his Supreme ""Scarface"" sweater.
He lists Urban Outfitters, Diet Starts Monday and Ubiq as his go-to stores in D.C.
""On the East Coast, people take their fashion pretty seriously,"" Oubre said. ""People don't really care what other people are doing. That's why I really like it here. Because it's more hard-nosed, more gritty.
""You kind of have to make a name for yourself -- just for yourself. It's not for everybody else, because nobody cares what you're doing. So that's why I just dress up every day. I gotta look stylish and fashionable every day because it makes me happy.""
Oubre's nickname, ""Wave Papi,"" is a persona all about believing in energy and not getting caught up in an egotistical world.
He plans to have his own fashion line, Dope Soul, up and running by the 2019-20 NBA season. The proceeds will go to an organization that benefits the community.
For now, he wears a lot of Supreme -- one of his favorite brands. Oubre made waves in December when he wore a Supreme sleeve in a game and subsequently had to have it removed. He gave that sleeve away, but he has still managed to fit the brand into his game outfit -- in his shoes.
The freedom to wear what he wants has come with age. Growing up, Oubre had to wear a uniform at school, so he learned to make his outfits look different by changing up his accessories or shoes.
""I would say I was a rebel,"" Oubre said. ""But what fashion icon isn't?""

Bazz Muhammad breaks down the pink Fear of God jacket he spent almost $1,500 on. (0:47)
It's a little after 7 p.m. on a chilly January night at Patron of the New in New York, and Shabazz Muhammad is browsing the racks inside the posh Tribeca clothing boutique.
The 6-foot-6 guard, at this point a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves, is dressed in a Balenciaga winter jacket, Fear of God track pants, a Vetements shirt and Vans x Fear of God shoes -- just a few of the hottest brands in fashion at the moment.
The 25-year-old Muhammad wasn't always fashion-forward, however. In fact, it wasn't until high school that he became interested in fashion. When he was a kid growing up in Southern California, he struggled just to match his clothes, and his mom had to step in.
""I'd put something on and she'd be like, 'It doesn't match,'"" Muhammad remembered. ""And now I think I'm pretty good in doing that. It kind of runs in the family now.""
Muhammad was in town for a game against the Brooklyn Nets, and the below-freezing temperatures wouldn't stop him from adding to his wardrobe.
NBA fashion has become a part of the game itself in recent years, and players flock to high-end brands and stores to look their best when caught on camera.
Just walking into an arena is like strutting down the runway these days. Those three minutes are photographed, shot on video and ingrained in the minds of NBA fans and fashionistas. It's where players such as Russell Westbrook have made their mark in the fashion world.
But Muhammad doesn't just dress to impress. His interest in fashion has expanded to taking part in fashion shows in New York, Paris and Milan.
Inside the store, Muhammad selected a few light jackets to try on, specifically a pink one. Muhammad said he goes for comfort over flash, but this jacket checked both boxes.
Shabazz Muhammad identifies Fear of God pieces he already owns, explaining why they are made so well for basketball players.
It would be a game-day jacket -- probably one he would wear when the Timberwolves are on national TV. It's a Fear of God piece, one of his favorite brands, and represented his laid-back style.
Muhammad counts Fear of God, Amiri, Off-White, Balenciaga and Palm Angels among his favorite clothing brands.
""When I'm looking for clothes, I look for the texture, because obviously, if you're spending a good amount of money on the clothes, you want it to be comfortable,"" Muhammad said.
As Muhammad waded through the racks, he denoted which items he already owned, including jackets, sweatpants and shorts.
Bazz Muhammad's go-to style? Laid-back and comfortable.
It's in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles where Muhammad has the most clothing options. It's not that Minnesota, where Muhammad played for five years before joining the Milwaukee Bucks on March 4, is behind the times, but his fashion sense wasn't recognized there as much.
""It's kind of cool to explain to them how the clothes are and how you wear them, so I think it's a pretty neat thing,"" Muhammad said.
Muhammad cited social media as a driving factor in the rise of athletes joining forces with the fashion world, and he said that picking out his outfits is a form of expression for him: ""I think it's pretty cool when you try to style yourself and you get compliments on how cool your fit it.""
Early in his career, he would look to buy more clothes and spend more money. Now, he's more selective and has a set budget on clothes. The most expensive piece of clothing in Muhammad's closet is a $4,000 Saint Laurent jacket. The cheapest? T-shirts that are $200 to $300. Even his loungewear is in the upper-price range. He said he would rather get multiple pieces for a few thousand dollars rather than just one piece that costs a few thousand on its own.
""I think it's really cool now that us basketball players and all athletes are really starting to dress [up],"" Muhammad said, ""because it's something that you can talk about, and it's really fun to go out and shop in your spare time.""

Rachel Nichols breaks down how Steph Curry's knee injury could affect the Warriors down the stretch and in the playoffs. (3:18)
Stephen Curry's MCL sprain raises big questions for the defending champion Golden State Warriors.
Although Curry is scheduled to be reevaluated at the start of the playoffs, Warriors coach Steve Kerr has already said Curry won't play in the team's first-round series. That decision should have been expected anyway given the timetable for Grade 2 sprains like the one Curry suffered, which typically sideline players about six weeks.
So Golden State will have to win at least one playoff series without Curry, then hope to get him healthy for deeper rounds of the playoffs. How good are the Warriors without the two-time MVP? And how well should we expect Curry to play when he returns? Let's take a look.
The Warriors are 14-11 in games Curry has missed this season. However, in some of those games, none of Golden State's four All-Stars saw action. The other three besides Curry should be back in time for the postseason.
In games in which Golden State has its other three All-Stars healthy, but not Curry, the Warriors have gone 6-4 while playing at a level adjusted for opponent and location of about 3.4 points per 100 possessions better than an average team. That's about equivalent to the plus-3.6 net rating of the Utah Jazz, Golden State's most common first-round opponent in simulations using ESPN's Basketball Power Index.
Before you start predicting an upset, let's note that there's reason to believe that performance underrates the Warriors without Curry. Largely because of a dismal performance against the Denver Nuggets on Dec. 23, Golden State's offensive rating with the other stars but without Curry is just 0.6 points per 100 possessions better than its opponents typically allow. We'd expect more from a team that still boasts a former MVP in Kevin Durant plus the outside shooting of Klay Thompson.
In a playoff setting, Kerr will probably extend Durant's playing time beyond what he has played in the regular-season games Curry has missed (35.2 minutes per game), keeping a go-to scorer on the court as much as possible.
The depth chart at point guard also figures to be different in the playoffs. Quinn Cook, who has been starting at the point in Curry's absence over the past three weeks, isn't currently eligible to play in the postseason because he's on a two-way contract. Though the Warriors will surely waive a player to make room for converting Cook to a standard NBA contract before the playoffs, he's unlikely to play such heavy minutes as the 33.9 he's averaging in that span.
Veteran Shaun Livingston will probably see more action in the postseason -- he logged 27.7 minutes per game during the 2016 playoffs before Curry returned. Kerr might even toy with lineups that don't have a traditional point guard, using Durant, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala as primary ball handlers to get his best players on the court as much as possible in a competitive series.
Add in home-court advantage and Golden State should be favored against any possible first-round opponent. It's also a reach to suggest that teams in the bottom half of the West playoff race should prefer to play the Warriors rather than whichever teams end up third or fourth. Still, a first-round series without Curry looks much more competitive than one with him.
Given the way Curry was limited in the 2016 playoffs after suffering an MCL sprain during the opening round, concern about his level of performance when he returns is understandable -- particularly given that this is a more serious injury. (Curry's 2016 MCL sprain was rated a Grade 1, the least severe category, and he missed only two weeks before returning.)
The good news is Curry's experience wasn't typical for players coming back from MCL sprains. For a more hopeful perspective, Golden State fans need look no further than Durant, who suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in late February 2017 and returned near the end of the regular season. Durant certainly didn't appear hampered, as he was the best player on the court during the NBA Finals, winning MVP honors after the Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1 for their second title in three years.
When Durant was preparing to come back, I took a look at the performance of players after Grade 2 MCL injuries. I started with a list compiled by Jeff Stotts of InStreetClothes.com in 2015 and added players who missed the typical time for a Grade 2 sprain but had no specific severity announced by their team.
Of that group, 15 players saw at least 250 minutes of action in the same season both before and after their MCL sprain. Here's how their performance in those spans compared.
Players actually had a slightly better rating per 36 minutes by John Hollinger's game score after the injury than before it. That's surely a fluke, but over the full sample of 28 players, performance after the injury was almost exactly what my SCHOENE projection system forecast for them before the season.
There is one interesting exception, which should be a concern with Curry: Players have not shot as well from 3-point range after returning from a Grade 2 MCL sprain as expected. Curry was, in fact, less accurate on 3s in the 2016 playoffs, shooting 40.2 percent after returning compared to 45.4 percent during the regular season. But the larger issue for Curry was inside the arc; he shot 56.6 percent on 2s during the regular season and just 48.5 percent in the playoffs.
Of course, every player and every injury is unique, so the average performance of all players with the same injury is only a guide to what we can expect. But the broader history does suggest a repeat of 2016 is unlikely. Golden State should expect to get Curry back at something close to full strength.

Rachel Nichols says it seems unfair that right before the playoffs and while the 76ers are playing well, they lose Joel Embiid. (2:50)
This NBA season has been marked by several notable, critical injuries. Here's a look at the most important injuries to watch for each team still breathing in the playoff chase, when those players could return and the seriousness of the situation.
Toronto Raptors: DeMar DeRozan
Timetable: None; he missed a win at Orlando on March 20 with a left thigh contusion but has played in each of the team's past five games.
Seriousness: very low
Situation: DeRozan is listed here only because he's the latest player to miss a game because of injury. Toronto is the healthiest team in the league that will appear in the postseason.
Boston Celtics: Kyrie Irving (and Gordon Hayward, Marcus Smart, Daniel Theis)
Timetable: Three to six weeks (from March 24) for Irving's left knee surgery. Hayward is unlikely to return this season from a left ankle injury. Six to eight weeks (from March 16) for Smart's right thumb surgery. Theis is out for the season following left knee surgery.
Seriousness: high
Kevin Pelton on Irving: There's not a lot of precedent for a player of Irving's caliber returning during the midst of the playoffs after missing an extended period. 
Cleveland Cavaliers: George Hill (and Kyle Korver)
Timetable: Hill sprained his left ankle on Friday and is out indefinitely. Korver has right foot soreness and last appeared in a game on March 19. 
Seriousness: medium
Situation: The Cavaliers are inching toward being fully healthy (including coach Tyronn Lue) for the first time since the trade deadline. Hill has started all 22 games he has played as a Cavalier this season, while Korver started in his past three appearances before taking a bereavement leave.
Philadelphia 76ers: Joel Embiid (and Dario Saric)
Timetable: Embiid had surgery to repair an orbital bone fracture on Mar. 31 and could return in two weeks. Saric has cellulitis in his shooting elbow and is day-to-day due to the soreness of the infection.
Seriousness: high
Kevin Pelton on Embiid: The timing of Embiid's injury is obviously difficult for him and the Sixers with their multiyear rebuilding process on the cusp of bearing playoff fruit. 
Indiana Pacers: Trevor Booker
Timetable: Booker sprained his right ankle Tuesday and missed a win at Sacramento on Thursday.
Seriousness: low
Situation: Booker is Indiana's second big man off the bench, behind starters Thaddeus Young and Myles Turner and top backup Domantas Sabonis. Any time that Booker misses is filled sparingly by first-round rookie T.J. Leaf.
Washington Wizards: John Wall
Timetable: Wall returned to action Saturday after missing more than two months because of a left knee injury.
Seriousness: medium
Situation: Wall's return decreases the seriousness of the situation, though he will continue to be ""managed"" for the remainder of the regular season. Wall was able to play 33 minutes in his first game back, while fill-in starter Tomas Satoransky's role in the rotation over Jodie Meeks is secure.
Miami Heat: Dion Waiters
Timetable: Waiters underwent season-ending ankle surgery on Jan. 23.
Seriousness: low
Situation: The Heat are used to playing without Waiters, and otherwise enter April at full strength. Tyler Johnson has established himself as the starting shooting guard, while Wayne Ellington and midseason trade acquisition Dwyane Wade are the backup guards.
Milwaukee Bucks: Malcolm Brogdon (and Thon Maker, Matthew Dellavedova)
Timetable: Six to eight weeks (from Feb. 2) for Brogdon's partially torn left quadriceps tendon. Maker has a right groin strain and last played on March 25. Dellavedova has a right ankle sprain and last played on Feb. 4; he is out indefinitely.
Seriousness: medium
Situation: Brogdon was injured the night before Jabari Parker made his season debut, and Dellavedova was injured in Parker's second game. Brogdon could return within a week, and he will be coming back to an uncertain role; he had been starting next to Eric Bledsoe at the time of his injury. Milwaukee has been starting Tony Snell at shooting guard while Jason Terry has been in the rotation. The injuries to Brogdon and Dellavedova were instrumental in Milwaukee signing 2009 first-round pick Brandon Jennings for the rest of the season. The Bucks would prefer to have Maker be their backup center over Tyler Zeller behind John Henson.
Detroit Pistons: Blake Griffin
Timetable: One week (from Friday) for Griffin's bone bruise on his right ankle.
Seriousness: medium
Situation: The Pistons' chances of making the playoffs are already on life support entering April. Detroit has had to start Anthony Tolliver while giving Henry Ellenson minutes at backup power forward because of Griffin's latest injury.
Houston Rockets: Chris Paul
Timetable: Paul has played only once since injuring his left hamstring on March 20 at Portland.
Seriousness: low
Situation: Paul is being managed; his injuries are minor. The Rockets have little to play for now that they have clinched the best record in the NBA. Houston will take it easy on Paul and allow him to rest up for the postseason.
Golden State Warriors: Stephen Curry
Timetable: Three weeks (from March 24) for Curry's left knee Grade 2 MCL sprain.
Seriousness: high
Kevin Pelton on Curry: Players have not shot as well from 3-point range after returning from a Grade 2 MCL sprain as expected. Curry was, in fact, less accurate on 3s in the 2016 playoffs, shooting 40.2 percent after returning compared to 45.4 percent during the regular season. But the larger issue for Curry was inside the arc; he shot 56.6 percent on 2s during the regular season and just 48.5 percent in the playoffs. Of course, every player and every injury is unique, so the average performance of all players with the same injury is only a guide to what we can expect. But the broader history does suggest a repeat of 2016 is unlikely. Golden State should expect to get Curry back at something close to full strength.
Portland Trail Blazers: Maurice Harkless (and Ed Davis)
Timetable: Two weeks (from Wednesday) for Harkless' left knee surgery; one to two weeks (from Saturday) for Davis' right ankle sprain.
Seriousness: medium
Situation: Harkless had scored in double figures in five of his past six games before getting shut down. His injury moves Evan Turner into the starting lineup and opens up more minutes for Pat Connaughton as a rotation wing. Davis' injury puts more on rookie lottery pick Zach Collins' plate, while fellow rookie Caleb Swanigan (picked late in the first round) may play more as well.
San Antonio Spurs: Kawhi Leonard
Timetable: Leonard last played on Jan. 13, and has no timetable to return from a right quadriceps injury.
Seriousness: high
Zach Lowe on Leonard: Without Leonard, the math of the Spurs' midrange-heavy shot selection works against them. Their shot profile hasn't budged from last season. With Leonard playing like an MVP in 2016-17, they outperformed their expected field-goal percentage -- based on shot location, shooters, and defender proximity -- by the fifth-largest margin in the league, per Second Spectrum. This season, they are shooting almost exactly as expected, and it isn't good enough -- especially since they don't gobble up free throws or offensive rebounds at a high rate. (Also: Why doesn't Danny Green play a little more?) The Spurs built this team to play a certain style, and without their foundational talent, they can't play it well enough to win at a high level.
Minnesota Timberwolves: Jimmy Butler
Timetable: Butler underwent meniscus surgery on his right knee Feb. 25 and is out indefinitely.
Seriousness: high
Situation: The Timberwolves put Nemanja Bjelica in the starting lineup at small forward and moved Andrew Wiggins to shooting guard after Butler's injury, and Minnesota is 8-7 since Butler last played. Butler's absence has led to a strict eight-man rotation for the Timberwolves, with Jamal Crawford taking on a larger role.
Oklahoma City Thunder: Andre Roberson
Timetable: Roberson had season-ending surgery to repair a ruptured patellar tendon in his left knee on Jan. 28.
Seriousness: medium
Situation: The Thunder have the NBA's 18th-ranked defensive efficiency rating since Roberson's injury, compared to the No. 5 defense at the time of the injury. Oklahoma City is now starting midseason buyout market acquisition Corey Brewer at shooting guard. Other than Roberson, the Thunder are fully healthy.
Utah Jazz: Ricky Rubio
Timetable: Rubio missed a win on Friday vs. Memphis because of left hamstring soreness and isn't expected to miss much more time.
Seriousness: low
Situation: Rubio's injury is minor, and the return of Dante Exum on March 15 from left shoulder surgery gives Utah another playmaking option behind rookie Donovan Mitchell. Royce O'Neale starts while Alec Burks enters the rotation when Rubio is out.
New Orleans Pelicans: DeMarcus Cousins
Timetable: Cousins had season-ending surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon on Jan. 31.
Seriousness: high
Zach Lowe on Cousins: Anthony Davis has seamlessly absorbed more ballhandling responsibility since Cousins' season-ending injury. He has averaged about seven drives per 100 possessions in that stretch, up from about four before then, per Second Spectrum tracking data. Davis isn't going to win the MVP, and he shouldn't. This is James Harden's season. But Davis deserves serious consideration for both MVP runner-up and Defensive Player of the Year.
LA Clippers: Danilo Gallinari (and Milos Teodosic, Avery Bradley, Patrick Beverley)
Timetable: Gallinari returned from a right hand injury on Friday; his previous appearance was Feb. 22. Teodosic (foot), Bradley (adductor surgery) and Beverley (right knee surgery) are out for the regular season.
Seriousness: medium
Situation: The volume of the Clippers' injuries is their biggest issue. Gallinari was injured so often this season that he didn't play in more than nine consecutive games, and in many of the 20 games he has appeared in, he's been at less than full health. The Clippers have had to deal with injuries to starting-caliber guards all season, and now Tyrone Wallace (on a two-way contract) is starting alongside Austin Rivers to allow Lou Williams to remain in his familiar bench scorer role.
Denver Nuggets: Gary Harris
Timetable: Harris has not played since injuring his right knee March 15. Denver coach Mike Malone said on Friday that Harris may miss another week.
Seriousness: high
Situation: Harris missed Denver's seven-game road trip, which wrapped up with Friday's 126-125 overtime victory against the Thunder. Will Barton has started in Harris' place, while Torrey Craig (two-way contract) has been in the rotation.

Zach Lowe is worried about the Celtics without Kyrie Irving, loves LeBron James finding teammates in the corner for 3-pointers and is a fan of Montrezl Harrell in tight confines. (3:09)
With less than two weeks left in the regular season, there's postseason uncertainty throughout both conferences. A rash of injuries to stars and impact role players -- all with murky roads to resolution -- coupled with the usual jockeying for seeding makes for a compelling home stretch.
The bottom half of each conference's playoff picture is also littered with potential land mines that offer up enormous contrasts in style and personnel. It could make for a potentially wacky first round.
Let's roll through some of the key questions as we try to make some sense of it all, including a look at the games that could determine seeding and matchups.
This might be the most important and impactful seeding race. Entering Friday, the Cleveland Cavaliers, Philadelphia 76ers and Indiana Pacers are separated by just a half-game. Why does this matter so much? If the Pacers come out on top, it would likely lead to a Cavaliers-Sixers opening series, and that could be a blockbuster ... if the injured Joel Embiid can make it back in time. (Cleveland holds the inside track to a home-court tiebreaker.) It would also present what's likely the most difficult path possible for LeBron James to reach his eighth straight NBA Finals.
In addition to facing a Sixers team that should only get stronger as benches shorten in the playoffs, the Cavaliers would then most likely face the Eastern-leading Toronto Raptors. Make it through them and there's a decent chance the Boston Celtics await in the conference finals -- and the longer you wait to face Boston, the more time Kyrie Irving and Marcus Smart get to recover from injury.

ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) currently handicaps No. 3 heavily in the favor of either the Cavaliers or Sixers, mostly due to the remaining schedules. Indiana has the hardest remaining schedule in the entire NBA, per BPI. Each of the Pacers' next four games are against teams well over .500, with three of them on the road, including at Toronto on the second night of a back-to-back after playing at home against the Golden State Warriors -- presumably with Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson back in the lineup.
Meanwhile, the 76ers sport the league's second-easiest remaining schedule, with the Cavaliers closer to middle of the pack. If the Pacers can keep pace through this daunting stretch, the potential three-team tiebreaker works in their favor by virtue of a 5-2 record in games against Philly and Cleveland.
Of course, the severity of Embiid's face injury will be a huge factor here; the Sixers have posted a net rating of plus-11.6 with their All-Star center on the floor and minus-3.9 when he's off. Avoiding LeBron and the Cavs early becomes even more important for the Sixers if Embiid can't go in Game 1 of the postseason.
In all likelihood, the Raptors will be the No. 1 seed in the East, but that doesn't mean there's no suspense for the North. Typically, a three-game lead with seven to play for a team on pace to win 60 would be insurmountable. Then you realize the Raptors' next three games are at Boston, at Cleveland then home against Boston on the second night of a back-to-back.
Although unlikely, it's not unreasonable to think they could drop all three and suddenly find themselves tied with the Celtics with one week left. BPI still likes the Raptors to finish atop the East, giving them a 94.5 percent chance, a number that's probably too low since it doesn't fully weigh the injury to Irving. (On Monday, ESPN's Jeremias Engelmann projected Toronto to have a 98.2 percent chance at No. 1 using real plus-minus and factoring in injuries. The Raptors have snagged another win since then, while Boston has won twice.)Editor's PicksThe next 11 players who could change the future of basketballWho will change the game and basketball culture next?

Who will change the game and basketball culture next?  These current and future NBA stars could be the new trendsetters.
How has the shape of the NBA draft changed with many of the top prospects out of the NCAA tournament? Jonathan Givony breaks down the new picks in both rounds.
There's more for the Raptors to play for even if they wrap up the No. 1 seed. Their most likely first-round opponent is the Milwaukee Bucks. Though Toronto won the season series 2-1, two of the three games went to overtime, and Jabari Parker only played once.
Either the Bucks or Miami Heat will likely finish as the No. 8 seed; they're currently a half-game apart. The Heat swept the season series, thus awarding them any potential tiebreaker for the No. 7 seed. If the Raptors decide they would much rather play the Heat than the Bucks, the schedule works out so that on the final day of the season, they might be able to do something about it. Toronto closes out on the road in Miami and could have a hefty incentive to win that game.
Without Parker and Eric Bledsoe, the Bucks took the Raptors to six games in the playoffs last season and held a 2-1 lead. With both of them now in the mix -- plus an improved Giannis Antetokounmpo -- Milwaukee potentially presents an early challenge that Toronto likely didn't expect with what has been the best regular season in franchise history. On the same night as Heat-Raps, the Bucks face the Sixers. Those could become two enormous games to watch.
Although Golden State is all but locked into the No. 2 seed, the Warriors' first-round matchup -- most likely without Stephen Curry -- is a total toss-up. According to BPI, there are five teams with between a 12 and 24 percent chance of facing the defending champs.

So, who might pose the biggest threat? At full strength, the New Orleans Pelicans, San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Timberwolves could all present some unique challenges. Yet with DeMarcus Cousins out and the status of both Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler in doubt, it's tough to peg just how dangerous each might be, especially since you can't simply assume Leonard or Butler would be themselves immediately upon return. We saw what happened last year with San Antonio once Leonard went down, and while Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins have proven capable of trading blows in the regular season, neither have experienced the postseason.
For different reasons, both the Utah Jazz and Oklahoma City Thunder could offer resistance if Golden State is short-handed.
Since the All-Star break, only the Houston Rockets have a better net rating than the Jazz, who have outscored teams by 8.6 points per 100 possessions. The defense has simply been on another planet, with a defensive rating of 95.6 -- nearly six points better than anyone else. The gap between Utah's defense and the second-best D since the break is larger than the gap between the No. 2 and No. 14 defenses. Without Curry on the floor, Golden State's offense has been merely average, scoring at a rate that would rank 15th leaguewide in offensive efficiency. If Utah can manufacture enough offense, it could be the team to give a Curry-less Warriors more resistance than they're accustomed to in early rounds.
Although the Thunder sit fifth in the West, they also have the NBA's second-hardest remaining schedule, which means a slide to No. 7 isn't out of the question. They've already beaten the Warriors twice this season, and Tuesday they can become the first team to knock the champs off three times in one regular season during the Golden State's run under Steve Kerr. Watch even a few minutes of Thunder-Warriors games and it's apparent Oklahoma City is not scared. OKC is 6-6 as an underdog this year -- best among West teams -- and as good a bet as anyone to knock off a heavy favorite early.
The Los Angeles Clippers and Denver Nuggets sit at No. 9 and No. 10 in the West with 34 and 10 percent chances, respectively, of making the playoffs, per BPI. If that seems low given the compact standings, it's worth keeping in mind that both teams have tough roads ahead. Each of Denver's final seven games are against teams with winning records, while the Clippers' only game against a team with a losing record comes in the season finale against a Lakers squad that ranks 10th in net rating since the All-Star break (and has zero tanking incentive).
The good news: Both teams get several shots to knock off current playoff teams. Denver faces Minnesota twice in the final week of the season, while the Clippers have games against the Spurs, Jazz and Pelicans.
The term ""must-win"" is overplayed, but if you're looking to circle two big dates in the race for No. 8, look at next Thursday (April 5) and Saturday (April 7). On Thursday, the Nuggets play the Wolves and the Clippers play the Jazz with head-to-head tiebreakers at stake. Then on Saturday, the Nuggets and Clippers face off. If both take care of business leading into that matchup, this could essentially act as a de facto play-in game to determine who has a real shot to sneak into the postseason.
Since the Nuggets play the Timberwolves twice, including in the regular-season finale, if Denver makes a run it could come at Minnesota's expense. The Wolves are trying to end a 13-year playoff drought, the NBA's longest active streak and second-longest in league history. Unless Towns is going to erupt for 56 every night, Butler's return could give Minnesota the jolt it so desperately needs amid concerns of its tank running on empty with Tom Thibodeau's insistence on relying almost exclusively on his starters.
If the drought continues and the Wolves collapse with tired legs, it will be easy to point to the fact that the Butler-Towns-Wiggins-Taj Gibson-Jeff Teague lineup still leads all five-man lineups by more than 100 minutes, despite the fact Butler has been out since Feb. 23.

As he took his talents down to Miami for the Cleveland Cavaliers's final regular-season matchup against the Miami Heat, LeBron James had a surprise in store for the return.
With Dwyane Wade's deadline trade back to the franchise where the duo reached four straight NBA Finals together, James was looking to celebrate the occasion with a nod to their early days in South Beach.
""The s--- I'm wearing tonight, they ain't never been seen before,"" James told media just before the game.
Upon adding a few pregame images to his Instagram story, the unveiling of his ""South Beach"" themed LeBron 15s instantly took the internet by storm.
Styled in a Miami Vice-influenced teal, black and pink palette, the new sneakers took inspiration from the LeBron 8 model that Nike launched in the fall of 2010, just as James was set to begin his first season in a Heat uniform. Unfortunately for everyone watching, the pair was made just for James and isn't expected to be released.
After pouring in 41 points against the New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers All-Star guard Damian Lillard jetted home to Portland in time for the birth of his first son, Damian Jr. Upon returning to the court Friday, Adidas surprised its signature athlete with a batch of baby editions of the Dame 4 awaiting Lillard at his locker.
As the crib pairs each featured ""Dame Jr."" and ""Lil' Dame"" custom text, it's safe to say baby Dame will go on to have quite the sneaker collection as he grows older. ""My boy gone represent,"" Lillard captioned on Instagram.
Around the league, as expected, Houston Rockets forward PJ Tucker continued his streak of wearing rare models, breaking out the ""Business"" LeBron 6 from 2008. Utah Jazz wing Thabo Sefolosha returned to the court, fittingly in his beloved Nike Air Max 90 retro running shoes, just as the brand was celebrating its annual marketing-driven pseudo holiday, Air Max Day.
Golden State Warriors wings Patrick McCaw and Nick Young both turned heads as well, with McCaw paying tribute to teammate Kevin Durant by wearing a 2012 edition of the KD IV that was originally made to commemorate his second scoring title. Swaggy P once again donned a former Kobe Bryant Adidas signature model, wearing The Kobe in a white-and-yellow makeup at home.

Rachel Nichols says it seems unfair that right before the playoffs and while the 76ers are playing well, they lose Joel Embiid. (2:50)
We offer a cornucopia of statistics in these schedule alert dispatches that, hopefully, help show how fatigue can seriously hinder performance during the grueling NBA grind.
But here is one figure that is far more jarring than any lopsided final score, dreadful shooting percentage or eye-popping turnover total: Two.
As in, there have now been two NBA head coaches who have stepped aside this season for severe health issues related to chronic sleep loss.
On March 19, Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue announced he was stepping aside to focus on his health, saying in a statement, ""I have had chest pains and other troubling symptoms, compounded by a loss of sleep, throughout the year.""
Lue, who hopes to return at some point this season, had also been coughing up blood, team sources told ESPN's Dave McMenamin.
""I ain't slept in days,"" Lue said back in November.
Earlier this season, Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford also stepped aside for health reasons, missing 21 games for severe headaches caused by what his doctors declared to be sleep deprivation, as we noted in our February schedule alert dispatch.
""Sleep is a big deal,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters in the wake of Lue's announcement. ""There's a lot of recovery that goes on when you're resting, and you need that.""
On that note, we highly recommend checking out this insightful NBA.com piece from David Aldridge that focuses on the above issue. It also surveyed NBA head coaches about how much sleep they get, if it's enough and how, if not, it affects them.
This response stood out: ""One coach who gets six hours on average per night said he's 'tired and fatigued all the time.' He would love to get more sleep, but it's almost impossible. He tries to compensate by taking naps on game days for half an hour up to 45 minutes.""
Now, on to some other statistics.
We correctly picked nine of 12 games in March and, so far this season, have correctly picked 41 of 53 games. As we've said in every dispatch since the beginning, our success rate -- which sits at 77.4 percent -- is notably higher than where our schedule alert formula suggested we'd be at this point. (Here is where we note that we applied that formula to 10 seasons' worth of games -- from 2007-08 through 2016-17 -- and the results showed that teams facing schedule alert situations with a MahScore of 8 or higher lose 63 percent of the time.)
As always, the strength of the team, which players are available or any other factors unrelated to the schedule are not taken into account in our formula.
A couple of notables:
Of the 41 schedule alert games lost so far this season, schedule alert teams have lost by an average of 13.4 points.
Of those 41 schedule alert losses, 11 have been by 21 or more points, and 16 have come by at least 15 points.
Of the 11 teams that won schedule alert games so far this season, nine of those teams are currently ranked in the top 10 of the Western Conference.
Only one non-Western Conference team has won a schedule alert game this season: Miami.
We'll have more numbers recapping how teams performed in schedule alert games in the coming days, including a wrap-up after our final 2017-18 game this month.
For now, here's a preview of April's lone schedule alert game -- the last of the 2017-18 regular season -- and below that are recaps of such games for March:
April 9: Orlando at Milwaukee | MahScore: 8
This game would seem brutal any day of the year for a team in the Magic's position, but it feels especially cruel given that it falls in their next-to-last game of the season.
The Magic will be playing their fifth game in seven days, third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set here. They will have played in Toronto the night before, on April 8, then will fly out immediately afterward -- gaining an hour along the way -- to Milwaukee to face the Bucks the next night. The Bucks, meanwhile, will enter this game with a one-day rest advantage.
Timberwolves lose to the Jazz 116-108 in Salt Lake City on March 2
MahScore: 9.5
Well, this one was spicy!
As we've noted here before, it's not unusual to see technical fouls or ejections from teams that are on schedule alert.
Sleep doctors will tell you that lack of rest affects the parts of the brain that control emotional reaction and judgment, so you are more likely to lose control of your temper and respond emotionally if, say, you don't like an officiating decision.Editor's PicksThe NBA's secret wine societyThe inside-the-bottle story of the intense love affair between NBA stars and the gilded grape.NBA mock draft: New lottery picks heading into Sweet 16How has the shape of the NBA draft changed with many of the top prospects out of the NCAA tournament?

The inside-the-bottle story of the intense love affair between NBA stars and the gilded grape.
How has the shape of the NBA draft changed with many of the top prospects out of the NCAA tournament? Jonathan Givony breaks down the new picks in both rounds.
So, one might not be too surprised to learn that two Timberwolves players were ejected from this game -- big man Karl-Anthony Towns late in the first half for arguing with the referees and guard Jeff Teague late in the game for hip-checking Jazz guard Ricky Rubio into the courtside seats. Jazz forward Jae Crowder was also ejected after jawing with Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau, who also received a technical foul in a heated game that featured five of them.
But if the Timberwolves were a bit frayed and thus on edge, well, you can't blame them. They lost to the Trail Blazers in Portland the night before, a nationally televised game which naturally ended later than most games. Then the Timberwolves flew out immediately after -- losing an hour along the way -- for Salt Lake City, where they would close out a back-to-back against a Jazz team that had been off for three ... whole... days.
So the ingredients added up to a Jazz win, right? Especially with this being a red alert affair?
Jazz coach Quin Snyder tried to temper such talk before the game, according to the Salt Lake Tribune, when he said, ""I think back-to-backs are overrated. Obviously it's a factor, but we've had, on our end, back-to-backs where we've played well and won. So I don't think you can say, 'A team is on a back-to-back, they're going to be tired that way.' I don't think it's the best way to prepare yourself for the game.""
Snyder is partially right. But it's also a factor, as he admits, and it's one that can't be overlooked, especially if you consider certain energy/effort-related statistics -- via ESPN Stats & Information -- that jump off the page.
A caveat: Yes, we know that losing Towns early in the game is a crucial element as to why the following numbers are so lopsided, but it's not the only reason.
The Timberwolves had two offensive rebounds, their fewest in a game in franchise history.
The Jazz outscored the Timberwolves 19-0 on second-chance points. It's the second game this season in which the Timberwolves have been held scoreless on second-chance points.
Nuggets beat the Cavaliers 126-117 in Cleveland on March 3
MahScore: 8
We'll get to this game lickety-split, but first, after it was over, Nuggets coach Mike Malone was explaining his team's performance, factoring in the fact they played the night before, when he paused.
""Is today Friday or Saturday?"" Malone asked reporters, according to the Denver Post. ""I knew it was a weekend night.""
It was a Saturday, but Malone's question harks back to our intro from March, when we noted how common disorientation can be during hectic stretches of the NBA schedule.
With that out of the way, let's break down the game ourselves -- and how Denver showed some serious grit in its league-high sixth and final schedule alert game of the 2017-18 season. (Denver's record in such games: 2-4.)
The Nuggets, who are making a late-season playoff push, came out white hot, scoring 73 points in the first half and leading by as many as 15 in the third quarter.
They finished with 19 3-pointers (their second most all season), 35 assists (their third most all season) and shot 54.7 percent from the field (their third-highest such figure all season).
Yet the Cavaliers charged back, and with 2:40 to play in the fourth quarter, Cleveland cut a double-digit lead to one point. From there, though, the Nuggets locked in, making all four of their shots to close the game while the Cavs missed three of their final four the rest of the way.
While praising the Nuggets for such an impressive effort under difficult circumstances, it's also worth considering, ever so briefly, the fact that their offensive outburst came against an atrocious defense. Cleveland entered the game ranked 28th in defensive efficiency. Since the Cavaliers' new players made their debuts on Feb. 11, Cleveland is allowing 1.49 points per chance on transition, second most of any team over that span, according to Second Spectrum data.
With that said, much credit is owed to the Nuggets for battling back.
""We put big numbers up,"" Malone said, according to the Post. ""... But to do it in a game where it's a back-to-back and you're not in your bed until 3 o'clock in the morning speaks volumes about our guys understanding where we are right now in the season and the importance of every game.""
Pistons lose to the Heat 105-96 in Miami on March 3
MahScore: 8
This marked the Pistons' fifth game in seven days, their third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set after facing the Magic in Orlando the night before.
The Heat, meanwhile, entered this game with a one-day rest advantage and were on the eighth day of a 10-day homestand.
As one might expect, the Heat took an 18-point lead after outscoring their guests 47-20 during a 17-minute span in the first half.
While the Pistons got big performances from Blake Griffin (31 points) and Andre Drummond (22 points and 18 rebounds), they got little from anyone else. Their guards combined to shoot 17-for-51 from the field and 4-for-18 from 3-point range, as noted by the Detroit Free Press.
The Pistons also had 19 turnovers and fell to 1-13 in their last 14 games on the road.
As noted by the Associated Press, Griffin played 36 minutes, during which the Pistons outscored the Heat by seven. But in the 12 minutes that Griffin sat, the Heat outscored the Pistons by 16.
""We played Blake into exhaustion,"" Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said afterward. ""We just struggled playing without him. He was dominant and every time he was out, we struggled.""
Grizzlies lose to the Mavericks 114-80 in Dallas on March 10
MahScore: 9
We expected this one to be ugly, as it registered as one of our grueling ""red alert"" games, but this was quite a brutal beatdown.
The Grizzlies were playing their fifth game in eight days, their third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set. They hosted the Utah Jazz the night before, then headed out afterward for Dallas, where they faced a Mavericks squad that entered the game with a huge three-day rest advantage.
The Mavericks led 31-13 after the first quarter and allowed their fewest points in any half this season while building a 56-30 halftime lead.
In all, it went into the ledger as the Mavericks' largest margin of victory this season.
Wizards lose to the Heat 129-102 in Miami on March 10
MahScore: 8
Yikes.
The Wizards were playing their third game in five days and the second of a back-to-back set, having played in New Orleans the night prior before flying out afterward -- losing an hour along the way -- to face the Heat the next day.
But even then, this was quite an ugly affair, even as far as schedule alert games go, as the Wizards had their five-game winning streak snapped while the Heat registered their highest-scoring regular-season game since Oct. 13, 2013.
""It's definitely embarrassing,"" said Wizards guard Jodie Meeks. ""There's no excuses for being tired.""
With the loss, the Wizards have lost four straight and five of their past six games on the second leg of a back-to-back set, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
Thunder beat the Hawks 119-107 in Atlanta on March 13
MahScore: 8
There the Thunder were, down 66-54 at halftime, after giving up a 38-point second quarter.
Oklahoma City was playing its fifth game in eight days, third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set, having hosted the Kings the night prior, then flying out immediately afterward -- losing an hour along the way -- for Atlanta to face the Hawks less than 24 hours later.
The Hawks, meanwhile, were on a one-day rest advantage.
In what was the Thunder's only schedule alert game of the season, it made sense that they had fallen into such a hole, even though it was against a far inferior opponent that at one point was playing three first-year players and another who had played only four games prior to this season.
But fatigue or not, deficit or not, the Thunder have Russell Westbrook and are making a playoff push, so they weren't about to let the lottery-bound Hawks trample over them.
Westbrook recorded his 100th triple double -- 32 points, 12 assists and 12 rebounds -- and helped spark a key 16-0 Thunder run that carried OKC to the win.
Lakers lose to the Warriors 117-106 in Oakland on March 14
MahScore: 8
This wasn't the prettiest affair -- not that many of these games are -- but the Warriors were missing three All-Stars (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green) because of injury.
The Lakers were playing their fifth game in eight days, third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set. They hosted the Denver Nuggets the night before, then flew to face the defending champions, who entered this game with a two-day rest advantage.
But the Warriors still had Kevin Durant (26 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds) and received a strong all-around effort from their role players, with seven players scoring in double figures.
The Warriors also opened the third quarter on a 21-7 run and made seven of their first eight field goals without any points from Durant, as the Associated Press noted.
What happened to the Lakers during that stretch -- or for much of the second half?
""I think we finally gave in to a little bit of fatigue,"" said Lakers coach Luke Walton. ""The guys just looked tired. I think they did a good job of trying to fight, trying to find it. Every time we made a run, they would get it back-cut or an offensive rebound and kick out. Durant kind of had his way with us, which he does with most teams. It felt like, to me, at the end of the day, we ran out of gas a little bit.""
Kings lose to the Jazz 103-97 in Salt Lake City on March 17
MahScore: 9
The night before this game, Kings coach Dave Joerger stood before reporters in Oakland, not long before his team was slated to face the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors were banged up, missing three of their All-Stars due to injury: Thompson, Curry and Durant. So what would it be like facing such a different lineup, Joerger was asked.
And then he took the interview in an entirely different direction.
""We're just trying to survive,"" Joerger said. ""Five games in seven nights. Five different cities, three different time zones. How we prepare ourselves, not having a practice day yesterday, not having a shootaround this morning, still having a breakfast meeting. We're just trying to plug away and get guys ready to compete. You know you're going to Utah to play them tomorrow, and they're sitting there resting.""
Indeed, Joerger perfectly illustrated the many challenges his team would be facing not against the Warriors but against the Jazz the next night in Salt Lake City.
So after facing the Warriors, the Kings would immediately fly out -- losing an hour along the way -- to Salt Lake City to face a Jazz squad that would enter this game with a one-day rest advantage.
The Kings were competitive for much of the night but managed just 18 points in the fourth quarter, when it seemed like they ran out of gas, as teams often do in these situations -- and as Joerger seemed to foreshadow the night before.
Raptors lose to the Cavaliers 132-129 in Cleveland on March 21
MahScore: 8
Everything was going so well for the Raptors. They dropped 38 points in the first quarter, then 41 in the second -- equaling a season-high 79 first-half points. Even better, they held a 15-point lead at intermission.
And then the second half came, and, as we know, that's when teams who are on schedule alert start to feel a little ... tired. But you can't blame the Raptors. They were playing their fifth game in seven days, third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set. They played in Orlando the night before, then headed out after to make the not-so-short flight to Cleveland, where the Cavaliers would enter this game with a one-day rest advantage.
In the third quarter, the Raptors were outscored by 14. Then they were outscored by four more in the fourth quarter and ultimately lost. Credit is due to their opponent and especially LeBron James, who tallied 35 points, 17 assists and nary a single turnover.
""Disgraceful display of defense by us,"" Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. ""We've got to be better than that.""
Clippers beat the Bucks 127-120 in Milwaukee on March 21
MahScore: 8
The Clippers talked a lot about energy after this one.
""We've got to be one team, one unit and play with high energy and compete,"" Clippers guard Austin Rivers said. ""Let's play harder than the other team.""
His father, Doc, the Clippers' coach, also praised the high energy that his team played with from the outset.
""The first seven minutes of basketball was as well as we've played all year,"" Doc Rivers said.
All credit to the Clippers, who are fighting for a playoff spot, for mustering up energy in this game, considering the circumstances. It marked their fifth game in seven days, their third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set. They played the Timberwolves in Minnesota the night before, then headed out afterward for Milwaukee, where the Bucks entered this game with a one-day rest advantage.
But the Clippers scored 38 first-quarter points, received 25 points and 22 rebounds from DeAndre Jordan and held off a late Bucks run.
Hawks lose to the Warriors 106-94 in Oakland on March 23
MahScore: 9
This marked our ninth and final ""red alert"" game of 2017-18 -- the designation we bestow on schedule alert games where one team faces an especially steep challenge thanks to the schedule.
The Hawks certainly qualified in that regard. They were playing their fifth game in seven days, their third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set. After playing in Sacramento the night before, the Hawks made the short trek over to Oakland to face the defending champions, who entered this game with a -- wait for it -- three-day rest advantage.
Three days!
Given that the Warriors were banged up, and lost Curry late in this game, the final score was somewhat reasonable and not the bloodbath it could've been if all things were equal.
The Hawks actually held a 51-43 lead at halftime, but the Warriors blitzed them soon after, scoring 36 points in the third quarter to take control. The Hawks wilted from there.
Bulls lose to the Pistons 117-95 in Detroit on March 24

Well, Bulls, the good news is you won't play in any schedule alert games until next season.
The bad news is you failed to win a single schedule alert game in 2017-18, going 0-4.
This game marked the Bulls' fifth game in eight days, their third game in four days and the second of a back-to-back set. They hosted the Bucks the night before, then headed out immediately afterward -- losing an hour along the way -- for Detroit to face the Pistons less than 24 hours later. The Pistons entered this game with a one-day rest advantage.
And this game was over pretty much from the start, with the Pistons building a 36-20 lead in the first quarter and cruising from there.
""Well it is tough,"" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said about the Bulls trailing by double digits early, ""but you have to find a way to fight through the fatigue and go out and muster up some energy.""

Zach Lowe is worried about the Celtics without Kyrie Irving, loves LeBron James finding teammates in the corner for 3-pointers and is a fan of Montrezl Harrell in tight confines. (3:09)
We went wild and included 11 things this week.
With about 6 minutes, 45 seconds left in the Boston Celtics' stirring win over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday -- the injury-ravaged Celtics' third win in eight days over a superior-on-paper Western Conference team -- the Jazz ran an unusual out-of-timeout play designed to spring Donovan Mitchell from the corner while help defenders gawked at decoy action.
Guerschon Yabusele -- Dancin' Bear, seldom-used backup -- sniffed out the play, ignored the planted distraction, jetted down from the foul line, and damn near stuffed Mitchell at the rim. Yabusele fouled Mitchell, but come on: That he was even in the neighborhood is emblematic of how hard and smart Boston has played without half its rotation -- including (in that game) its three best players.Editor's PicksLowe Post: Beck on Kidd, MVP race, playoff pictureZach talks to Bleacher Report's Howard Beck about his Jason Kidd feature (3:03), LeBron's MVP case (31:15), playoff races (44:15), and more.Lowe: What made Drazen Petrovic groundbreaking and unforgettableThe legacy of the pioneering Croatian and Nets guard -- his skill, his fight, his joy -- still runs through the NBA and Europe.1 Related
Zach talks to Bleacher Report's Howard Beck about his Jason Kidd feature (3:03), LeBron's MVP case (31:15), playoff races (44:15), and more.
The legacy of the pioneering Croatian and Nets guard -- his skill, his fight, his joy -- still runs through the NBA and Europe.
Boston is a nightmare to score on when it bookends lineups with Terry Rozier and Al Horford. Rozier has blossomed in Kyrie Irving's place, launching clutch off-the-bounce 3-pointers with Curry-level swagger. He is a ravenous rebounder. Brad Stevens has played Rozier and Shane Larkin together with some success.
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have expanded their playmaking in Irving's absence without sacrificing much efficiency. Boston is huge, and in your jersey, and it executes on both ends with minimal mistakes. You have to earn everything.
And yet as fun as this run has been, it masks an underlying danger: the Gordon Hayward-less Celtics still endure long dry spells without Irving, and they cannot accomplish anything at the basket. Only 32 percent of their shots have come within the restricted area, the fifth-lowest share in the league, and that number dips toward dead-last territory when Irving hits the bench, per Cleaning The Glass. (More of their attempts drift into the midrange.) Only Portland has a worse shooting percentage at the rim.
The Celtics don't scrounge extra points; they snare free throws and offensive rebounds at below average rates. Without Irving (and Marcus Smart's underrated playmaking), they profile as a team that would have trouble scoring against a dialed-in playoff defense. (Their most likely first-round opponent -- the Miami Heat -- suffers from the same issue, with better shot distribution and an offense that seems to surge every spring.)
But this streak has been great, rambunctious fun, and it has provided a last-minute boost to Stevens' Coach of the Year case.
No one can defend the Cleveland Cavaliers when they slot four shooters around LeBron. Cleveland's offense in that alignment is fun in its sheer power, but buckets come so easily, we don't get to see apex chessmaster LeBron. He requires more of a challenge.
Enter a non-shooting center -- Tristan Thompson, Larry Nance Jr. or Ante Zizic. When LeBron holds the ball on the wing in fearsome prelude, the defender guarding that guy will slough away to barricade LeBron's path to the rim. That is when LeBron goes to work.
That first rotation leaves the Cavs center open. A third defender will slide off another Cavs player -- usually a shooter in the corner -- to disrupt any alley-oop from James to Thompson. LeBron isn't really concerned with the first two defenders in his way. His target -- his victim -- is that third guy. If LeBron baits him into taking an extra step toward Cleveland's center, it's over; LeBron is slingshotting the ball to a shooter before the defense can register what is happening:
Sometimes, he'll fake that pass, trick the defense into retreating to outside shooters, and loft a lob to his center. Some of his most artful work in the 2016 NBA Finals, the crowning moment of LeBron's career, involved threading a few such lobs between Golden State defenders paralyzed with indecision.
If the defense smothers both options, that means they probably haven't sent the proper help toward LeBron. He will register that, shift into attack mode, and draw the requisite rotations with a few hard dribbles:
LeBron is the best generator of corner 3s in basketball history. That is the product of his all-seeing size, his coming of age amid the 3-point revolution, and most of all, his rare genius. At 33, in his 15th season, that genius remains in full bloom. Don't argue about it. Just enjoy it.
Snell's confidence wavers. On bad nights, he passes up open 3s and dribbles with a timidity that undercuts the purpose of dribbling. He has used only 10.6 percent of the Milwaukee Bucks' possessions, and it is really hard for an ambulatory perimeter player to record a number so low. It's unclear if he realizes he is allowed to get rebounds and attempt free throws.
But the impulse from two coaches -- Jason Kidd and now Joe Prunty -- to bench Snell, and then slice his minutes, is a little troubling. Kidd replaced Snell in the starting lineup with Malcolm Brogdon. Last week, Prunty swapped him out in favor of Jason freaking Terry before reinserting Snell Thursday, and Snell has played 13 or fewer minutes in three of Milwaukee's last five games.
The engaged version of Snell is a perfect starter next to Giannis Antetokounmpo, Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton. He defends across three positions, and he's shooting 41 percent from deep -- unclogging the lane for Antetokounmpo's rampages. He doesn't need the ball.
That same profile carries much less value on bench units in need of more off-the-dribble juice -- even with Jabari Parker healthy. Terry is ancient. Brogdon is a fine shooter and canny screen-setter for Antetokounmpo, but a lot of his skills overlap with those of Milwaukee's big three.
Prunty is the interim coach of a No. 8 seed. He doesn't have time for Snell's fragility.
But marginalizing Snell is unhealthy in both the short and long term. The best version of this Milwaukee team, and probably next season's, features Snell as a 3-and-D fifth starter. Both sides need to work harder to find that player.
Mudiay finally perked up in his past two games, but holy hell has the Mudiay era with the New York Knicks been a tough watch.
Years of bonking shots around the rim have reduced Mudiay to a certain skittishness navigating the pick-and-roll. He has developed a bad habit of gaining an advantage, turning the corner, and giving the advantage right back:
From the moment Mudiay traps Goran Dragic on his hip, the worst possible outcome other than Mudiay throwing the ball away is Mudiay sliding back for a midrange brick.
In Mudiay's defense, this sort of surrender isn't uncommon among young point guards. Kyrie Irving did it a lot in his first two seasons -- perhaps out of arrogance rather than uncertainty -- and D'Angelo Russell is struggling with it now. But Mudiay has to regain confidence in his finishing skills, and build out from there.
Mudiay has been mostly awful in the NBA -- a tank commander of the highest rank. But there is an interesting player in here somewhere. He shot well on catch-and-shoot 3s last season. He's big and fast enough to get where he wants to go, and his vision is ahead of his judgment. He's shooting 68 percent at the rim as a Knick -- blowing away his (ugly) career numbers. Everyone in Denver praises his resiliency. He just turned 22.
He is playing amid a makeshift, tanking team. Provide some stability, and he could grow into something.
Traditionalists have to accept that Nike and the NBA have destroyed the custom of home teams wearing white. It's over.
I don't mind. Most dark jerseys are more interesting. Would you be mad if the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls wore green and red, respectively, every game? When neither team wears white, the color-against-color look usually pops.
One downside: There is a weird cognitive dissonance when two teams with similar color schemes face each other, and the road team wears white. It caused a glitch in my brain on Tuesday when Chicago wore white with red trim in Houston -- where the Rockets once wore white with red trim. The team in white would do something dumb, the crowd would cheer, and some sector of my subconscious went haywire.
I am not alone in this, right? Please tell me I'm not alone.
Ground-bound plodders can be neutral defenders if they are smart, and play hard all the time. Nikola Vucevic approached neutrality last season. It didn't carry over. Vucevic has defended with a strange listlessness. Help rotations don't happen, or come with such reluctant sloth that they offer no resistance against the endless opponent layup line.
Enemy shooters have hit 66 percent of their shots at the rim with Vucevic nearby, seventh-worst among 64 rotation centers, per NBA.com. He lurches into passing lanes on the pick-and-roll instead of sliding his feet and maintaining balance. Too often, he lurches himself right out of the play. The Orlando Magic are bleeding points when opponents rope Vucevic into the pick-and-roll, per Second Spectrum tracking data.
It's as if six years of losing under four coaches -- and the deterioration of his shooting percentage -- has sapped his spirit. That is a very human thing. Most players hit spells when losing, a poisonous locker-room, or some off-court issue infects their play.
Vucevic is better than this. Hopefully he reminds us next season.
Harris might be the league's happiest player development success story. Two years ago, Cleveland dumped him onto Orlando to open a roster spot. Orlando waived him, and he signed with the Nets.
Last season, they gave Harris the Kyle Korver playbook and a green light. He proved he could knock down catch-and-shoot 3s, and defend with a ruggedness that surprised opponents who assumed he was a pushover.
Defenses blitz Harris now, and he has leveraged that into a dangerous driving game. He doesn't even need a pump fake, and he knows it:
Harris drives about 8.5 times per 100 possessions, up from about six last season, and he finishes inside with the right measures of aggression and patience. If help swarms, he knows where the next pass should go. The Nets have scored almost 1.25 points per possession after a Harris drive, one of the three-dozen best marks among 300-plus high-volume drivers, per Second Spectrum.
Harris' pick-and-roll numbers are even better. Brooklyn averages 1.14 points per possession when Harris shoots out of a pick-and-roll, or passes to a teammate who lets fly right away. That ranks first among all ball-handlers -- FIRST! -- who have used at least 75 screens, per Second Spectrum. He has doubled the number of his pull-up 3s from last season.
Harris is not some James Harden-style puppet master piercing defenses from a standstill. The Nets often give him a head start by having him zip up from the baseline, catch the ball up top, and zoom toward a waiting screen. Even so: The numbers are outrageous, and suggest an evolving player.
Harris is a worker, and the Nets are turning themselves into one of the league's best player development labs. Harris is about to sign a fat contract.
Smart feet and good feel are nice, but to be a productive NBA player, you actually have to, like, do stuff. Bender has spent too much of his brief NBA career not doing stuff. In early March, he became the first player since 2012 to log 36 minutes in a game and attempt one or zero shots and zero free throws.
Bender is 20. He missed almost half his rookie season. Perhaps any expectations are unfair. But at some point, the No. 4 pick in the draft -- even a 20-year-old -- has to try things. Good news: Bender is flashing a friskier handoff game -- complete with delightful play-action-fake keepers:
(Yeah, he missed. Baby steps. At least you realized Bender was on the floor.)
The fully formed version of Bender -- the one that will play for a competitive NBA team in the early 2020s -- will look something like this: a big-man fulcrum who can shoot, drive, and pass, and run the offense for snippets. He's even doing the thing where he fakes a handoff, pitches the ball to another teammate along the 3-point arc, and runs right into a pick for that player:
That is a classic Marc Gasol/Nikola Jokic/Boris Diaw move. Since early February, Bender has set almost 26 ball screens per 100 possessions, up from 18 before then, per Second Spectrum tracking data. That is partly the result of Tyson Chandler's disappearance (has anyone seen Tyson Chandler; is he in a hair salon?) but it is a legitimate version of the ""player development"" teams trumpet when they mothball veterans and try to lose.
The Phoenix Suns still need to decide what position Bender plays, and what sort of frontcourt partner he requires (the Bender-Marquese Chriss tandem has been a disaster) but these flashes are encouraging.
Unless the Sacramento Kings get The Guy in this draft -- and they've hurt their chances with a few recent loss-wins -- they will need someone among the De'Aaron Fox/Buddy Hield/Willie Cauley-Stein/Bogdan Bogdanovic/Skal Labissiere group to really pop over the next three or four years. They are each on vaguely encouraging trajectories, but it's a long way from adding up to anything meaningful.
It's easy to forget about Justin Jackson. He's 23, without the same hoppy athleticism as some of those guys. He fell out of the rotation for stretches after opening the season as a starter.
But over the past two months, he has emerged as worth watching, and that alone is a win for the Kings. He's 17-of-45 from deep in March, keeping alive the possibility that he might grow into an average 3-point shooter. He moves well on defense, and tries hard.
He's also got a nifty floater -- a key weapon for guys who can't power through behemoths at the rim:
That's awkward, but it works for Jackson. He has taken a ton of floater-range shots, and made 44 percent of them, per Cleaning The Glass -- a tidy mark. You can't build an offense around 44 percent 2-pointers, but it's a nice break-in-case-of-shot-clock-emergency tool.
Harrell has a knack for twirling and slithering through cramped quarters, and flicking the ball up before shot-blockers get off the ground. He is shooting 53 percent on post-ups, one of the best marks in the league. His baseline spin-o-rama is deadly:
Further out, Harrell likes to flash open around the foul line, catch on the move, and loft quick-hitting floaters and runners with a silky touch. He doesn't need much space to flit, and that has allowed Doc Rivers to experiment with Harrell alongside his centers -- DeAndre Jordan, Willie Reed (before the LA Clippers traded him) and now Dancin' Boban Marjanovic. Those duos are plus-1 in more than 300 minutes combined -- not much, but good enough for an injury-riddled team to steal time.
The Clips have a better overall scoring margin with Harrell on the floor, and he's shooting 64 percent. His activity is infectious. Not bad for a Chris Paul throw-in.
OK, Brandon!
I don't know that I've ever seen a double-dive. Kara Lawson, killing it in her first season as Washington's lead TV analyst, said the same thing on the broadcast. Points for creativity!

LeBron James and Anthony Davis are set to match up in a highly anticipated showdown Friday night. (1:03)
Coming out of college, Anthony Davis was supposed to be the NBA's next great defensive big man, locking down the paint against all opponents with the intimidating rim protection of a throwback player. He was hyper-athletic and long, with a 7-5½ wingspan, and in college he had run away with the NCAA defensive player of the year award. On offense, he was a rawer prospect with the explosiveness to finish around the rim but a questionable jumper and lack of a polished attacking style. His comps: Marcus Camby, Bill Russell, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan.
Fast-forward six years and Davis is in the midst of a late-season surge into MVP runner-up. He did remain a strong shot-blocker, ranking second in the NBA with 2.2 BPG this season, and he has made the NBA All-Defense second team in two of the past three seasons. But, surprisingly, scoring has become his calling card as a pro. Davis is second in the NBA in points this season with an efficient 28.2 PPG on 61.6 percent true shooting, and he has finished in the top seven in scoring for four straight seasons. Davis worked hard on his perceived scoring weaknesses, and he's made them strengths with an excellent face-up game off the dribble that is bolstered by a consistent jump shot that he can knock down out to beyond the 3-point line.Editor's PicksNBA Future Power Rankings: Who will reign for the next three years?How will your team perform the next three seasons?

How will your team perform the next three seasons? Kevin Pelton and Bobby Marks forecast the future for every NBA franchise.
Giannis. Embiid. Lonzo. Which young stars are taking over now and in the future?
Instead of Russell, Camby or even Duncan, Davis' pro game has been more reminiscent of a combination of two legendary bigs who weren't often mentioned before the 2012 draft: David Robinson and Dirk Nowitzki.
Davis, like Robinson, had a late growth spurt that took him from playing guard to center. Robinson was 5-foot-9 his junior year of high school, grew to 6-7 in his senior year, then up to 7-1 while at the Naval Academy. Davis was 6-3 as a junior in high school but hit 6-10 by the time that he graduated. Both players retained much of the quickness and skill of their shorter selves even after they attained their full heights.
Like Robinson, Davis is a dangerously fast big man who can fly down the court to finish on the break. He is a nightmare finisher around the rim on alley-oops (82.4 EFG on 370 lobs since 2013-14 season, per Second Spectrum) and offensive rebounds (66.1 EFG on 263 tips since 2013-14, per Second Spectrum). In iso situations, Davis has a Robinson-like lightning-quick first step with the confident handle of a former guard on drives (52.7 EFG on 628 driving layups since 2013-14, per Second Spectrum). The latter feature is one of the keys to his face-up offensive style that has served him so strongly as a pro.
The other primary feature of Davis' scoring prowess is his jump shot. In college he had excellent mechanics but only made 34.3 percent of his jumpers overall -- 29.8 percent in catch-and-shoot situations and 25.0 percent on unguarded looks. In the pros, he has improved his jumper dramatically to the point that his face-up game is reminiscent of a young Nowitzki. Both have the length that forces opponents to typically guard them with big men, but they have the quickness and comfort on the perimeter that most opposing bigs aren't capable of matching.
Both Davis and Nowitzki are adept at moving without the ball, finding soft spots in the defense to nail open jumpers off the catch. Both have consistent shooting range on deep midrange jumpers, with distance out beyond the arc. Nowitzki was the more natural 3-point shooter early, but Davis is displaying this season an ability to knock down the trey at slightly higher volumes.
Plus, Nowitzki was one of the greatest pick-and-roll bigs of all-time because of his ability to either shoot or drive against an imbalanced defense. Davis is following in those footsteps, generating 0.960 points per play in 8,048 direct picks as the screen-setter since 2013-14, per Second Spectrum.
Here's how the three compare during their first five seasons as All-Stars.
Davis' numbers are an almost exact meld between Robinson's more interior approach and Nowitzki's more outstanding perimeter jumper.
Now, a similar comparison for their more volume-based production over the same time:
Again, Davis' production measures out as a combination of the two greats. Davis has a slightly higher scoring volume than his predecessors did (about two more points per 100 possessions), but he's a bit less involved in setting up teammates. Young Nowitzki had the best assist-to-turnover ratio here, with Robinson having higher volume of assists but also turnovers, and Davis producing low volumes of both. This plays a part in his overall offensive impact, because in most situations creating offense for teammates generates a greater effect than being purely a finisher.
Robinson and Nowitzki went on to win the MVP trophy in the next seasons after the ones cited here. If he had played at his current level over the entire year and the Pelicans were able to finish among the top few teams in the West, Davis may have been a viable lead MVP candidate over James Harden in 2018.
His candidacy next season depends on being able to lead the Pelicans off to a big start before DeMarcus Cousins is fully healthy (assuming Boogie returns in free agency) and helping the team maintain a great record all season. If he can do those two things while even maintaining his new peak, Davis may just be able to join his stylistic predecessors in hoisting the MVP trophy next season.

Karl-Anthony Towns joins Russell Westbrook and James Harden as the only players with 50 points, 15 rebounds and five 3-pointers, setting a Timberwolves single-game scoring record with 56 points. (0:57)
Who might join ESPN's rankings of the greatest game-changers in NBA history the next time we update the list?
Our rankings were based on who has done the most to change the way we play the game, how we talk about the game and the culture of basketball. That's not always easy to predict, but let's take a look at some young players not currently in the top 100 who have a chance to emerge as game-changers over the course of their careers.
In many ways, it's LaVar Ball who's the real game-changer off the court. However, Lonzo's game is revolutionary in its own way.
Not since Jason Kidd have we seen a point guard so willing to throw the ball ahead in transition, empowering his teammates to make plays before the defense is set. Ball is also the rare modern point guard whose game isn't built primarily around operating out of the pick-and-roll. His difficulties shooting off the dribble or beating opponents to the hoop mean Ball must create opportunities for himself and teammates in different ways.
In a league increasingly dominated offensively by ball handlers and 3-point shooters, Davis stands as an exception.
Per Basketball-Reference.com, his 28.3 points per game this season are the best by a player 6 feet 10 or taller since Shaquille O'Neal averaged 28.7 per game in 2000-01. And since teammate DeMarcus Cousins went down with a ruptured Achilles, Davis has averaged an incredible 31.2 PPG. No player 6 feet 10 or taller has topped 30 in a full season since Moses Malone in 1981-82.
In the midst of his best NBA season, DeRozan advanced the discussion about mental health in the NBA. DeRozan's tweet quoting the Kevin Gates song ""Tomorrow"" opened the door for him to discuss his occasional battles with depression with Toronto Star beat reporter Doug Smith.
In turn, Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers credited DeRozan's comments for encouraging him to discuss panic attacks he'd suffered this season in a first-person article for The Players' Tribune. As the conversation about mental health in the NBA becomes more open and honest, DeRozan deserves credit for his game-changing candor.
While game-changers Sarunas Marciulionis and Drazen Petrovic proved guards from Europe could successfully play in the NBA, with the exception of Tony Parker, the biggest stars Europe has produced remain primarily post players.
As perhaps the greatest European prospect in the modern era, the precocious Doncic has the chance to change that history. At age 19, Doncic is the best player in the EuroLeague, the second-best basketball competition in the world. That makes him a possible No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA draft. No player has gone No. 1 without playing college basketball since Andrea Bargnani in 2006.
The self-proclaimed ""Process"" has proved a trustworthy contributor after getting back on the court following two seasons lost to a navicular fracture. At 7 feet and a listed 250 pounds, Embiid is a powerful force around the basket who also has attempted more than three 3-pointers per game the past two seasons and occasionally will blow by poor closeouts to drive from the perimeter and finish above the rim.
Still, Embiid's greater game-changing potential might be off the court. Before he played an NBA game, Embiid already was a star thanks to his comedic Twitter presence. He has somehow turned Instagram's location feature into a tool to troll opponents. Future stars should take lessons from how Embiid has made social media work for him.
Past prospects who skipped NCAA basketball to play overseas (Brandon Jennings, Jeremy Tyler, Emmanuel Mudiay) have failed to yield an anticipated copycat effect. It's possible the year Ferguson spent playing in the Australian NBL could have more lasting impact. With the NCAA eligibility of top players increasingly fraught in the wake of the FBI's investigation of amateur basketball, the NBL seeks to build on Ferguson's stint Down Under -- which saw him drafted 21st overall by the Thunder last June -- to bring other top prospects to Australia.
ESPN's Jonathan Givony reported earlier this month that the NBL plans to offer such players $100,000 Australian salaries (about $78,000 U.S.) funded by the league as part of its ""Next Stars"" program. It's possible the NBA lowering its age limit could undercut the NBL's efforts, but for now it looms as a more lucrative alternative to the NCAA -- thanks in part to Ferguson's example.
Typically, 6-foot-10 centers don't offer highlight-caliber passing and serve as their teams' de facto point guards.
Jokic is changing the game with his combination of court vision, creativity and willingness to attempt difficult passes others wouldn't throw. His 6.0 assists per game this season are the most by a full-time center since Wilt Chamberlain averaged 8.6 per game in 1967-68.
The nickname ""Unicorn"" no longer feels appropriate for Porzingis, who has proved a harbinger of the trend toward stretch 5s rather than one of a kind.
Consider that when Porzingis made his NBA debut, just eight players in league history had posted seasons with at least 100 3-pointers and 100 blocks. Six players, including the 7-foot-3 Porzingis, have done it in the past three seasons alone.
There have been big point guards before, most notably Magic Johnson (No. 3 on the list of game-changers), and point forwards like LeBron James (No. 2). Before Simmons, however, there had never been a full-time point guard who stood 6 feet 10.
As a rookie, Simmons has rewarded 76ers coach Brett Brown's decision to use him in that role, racking up 10 triple-doubles and averaging an unprecedented 8.0 rebounds and 8.0 assists per game as perhaps the most versatile rookie we've ever seen.
While Porzingis got tabbed the Unicorn, Towns' skill set might be harder to find because of how well he scores both inside and out.
So far this season, Towns leads all NBA players who have finished at least 125 post-up plays with a shot, trip to the free throw line or a turnover by averaging 1.04 points per play, according to Synergy Sports tracking on NBA Advanced Stats. Overplay Towns in the post and he'll simply step out to the perimeter, where he's shooting 42.8 percent on 3-pointers this season -- the best accuracy ever for a 7-footer with at least 150 attempts, per Basketball-Reference.com.
As an undersized point guard with a penchant for shooting long 3s off the dribble, Young is a spiritual successor of two-time MVP Stephen Curry (No. 10 on the list of game-changers). Yet Young is traversing new ground for a player of his ilk as a dominant scorer from his first day on campus.
Young became the first player to lead Division I in both points and assists per game since the latter became an official NCAA statistic in 1983-84. If he can translate that success to the NBA, Young will prove Curry isn't one of a kind.

George Mikan carried pro basketball for the decade following World War II and nearly broke the sport.
Exemplifying his domination was a famous marquee at Madison Square Garden declaring ""George Mikan vs. the New York Knicks."" Despite the slight at Mikan's talented Minneapolis teammates, the marquee spoke a truth. In his eight seasons playing in the NBL, BAA and finally NBA, Mikan's team won seven titles. The only year his team didn't win the title was 1951, when he had a broken leg.
His domination of the paint with ambidextrous hook shots caused the NBA to widen the lane and adopt the shot clock as teams would too often stall, preventing the superstar from getting a shot. The bespeckled Mikan's play was the catalyst -- even if unintended -- for revving up the pace and speed of basketball. -- Curtis Harris

The résumé of five championships, two MVP awards, 15 All-Star selections and a 20-season record of incomparable consistency represent only a fraction of Duncan's quiet influence on the game he mastered. He also was the spiritual leader of basketball's most admired organization.
""Before you start handing out applause and credit to anyone else in this organization for anything that's been accomplished, remember it all starts with and goes through Timmy,"" said Gregg Popovich on the eve of the 2014 Finals.
As the Spurs continued their reign of excellence and resilience, winning titles despite inferior athletic talent, the rest of the league looked to imitate them. A generation of NBA executives recognized that Duncan's emotional intelligence was the connective tissue that helped Popovich execute the vision in San Antonio. They then went out to find their Tim Duncan, so that they could fashion a team culture modeled after the Spurs. -- Kevin Arnovitz

Elgin Baylor had a remarkable career that always seemed to have an ill-fated quirk.
He has the third-highest scoring average in NBA history, but never led the league in scoring for a season. He appeared in the Finals eight times and set a Finals single-game record of 61 points, but never won a title. His play saved the Lakers franchise financially, and yet when he gracefully retired early in the 1971-72 season, that's when the team went on a record-setting win streak and finally won the championship.
Regardless of the quirks, Baylor is a titan of the sport and human dignity. He showed the league what hangtime was all about with an array of reverse layups, contorted one-handers and double-pump jumpers. And after his playing career, he served 22 years for the often woeful Los Angeles Clippers, winning Executive of the Year in 2006.
Off the court, he protested segregated hotels and restaurants. During the 1964 All-Star Game strike, Tom Heinsohn recalled that Lakers owner Bob Short yelled at someone, ""You go tell Elgin Baylor that if he doesn't get his ass out here fast, I'm done with him!'"" Baylor's reply summed up his determination to see the strike and labor movement through: ""Tell Bob Short to go [expletive] himself."" -- Harris

Unlike with baseball and Jackie Robinson, integration in the NBA hinged not on a single player but on multiple players arriving in 1950, three years after Robinson's MLB debut.
Though Chuck Cooper was the first black player drafted, Earl Lloyd was the first to play in an actual game. Nat ""Sweetwater"" Clifton was the first to join the league from the Harlem Globetrotters. Don Barksdale was the first black All-Star and before joining the NBA was the first black NCAA All-American and first black player to win gold in basketball at the Olympics.
Lloyd would later go on to be the first black player to win an NBA title and serve as an assistant coach.
In 1947, Wat Misaka joined the BAA (forerunner of the NBA) to become the league's first non-white player and the first player of Asian descent.
Within a decade of the debuts of Lloyd, Cooper, Clifton and Barksdale, the NBA had many black players, including MVPs Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. -- Harris

Mike D'Antoni might have been the intellectual godfather of the ""7 Seconds or Less"" movement, but two-time MVP Steve Nash was the engine that propelled it. Bursting off a drag screen in transition, then probing into the gut of a backpedaling defense, Nash created the chaos and then delivered the pinpoint passes that found his 3-point shooters and empowered the small ball that defined an era.
""When we first got Steve, it was like, 'OK, let's run,'"" D'Antoni says, ""But he's already going. I'm like trying to direct from the sidelines a little bit, plays and stuff, set, but was gone. So I'm going, 'This is great!'""
A revolutionary playmaker, Nash also was a superlative shooter who compiled a 49.0 percent average from the field, drained 42.8 percent of his 3,939 3-point attempts and shot over 90 percent from the free throw line. That combination of kinetic energy, creative passing and sharpshooting endures as a blueprint for the prototypical point guard in the modern, high-pace era of NBA basketball. -- Arnovitz

Nowitzki is the greatest NBA player from Europe, an MVP, an NBA champion and a Finals MVP. He has more than 30,000 points and counting at age 39. Just those credentials would easily secure him a place on this list.
But there's more. Just as teams used to look for another Michael Jordan or another Tim Duncan, they now have their sights set on finding another Nowitzki, from no matter where. His outside shooting has been so accurate and prolific that it has changed the way teams look at power forwards, with stretch-4s (and 5s) being prized.
Over the years, his unique talent helped the Dallas Mavericks to put up some of the most efficient offensive numbers in history and allowed coach Rick Carlisle to create innovative schemes with more shooting on the floor, culminating in an NBA title in 2011.
And let's not forget ""The Dirk,"" his signature one-legged fadeaway that players around the league have picked up -- but to varying degrees of success, indicating perhaps there really is only one Dirk Nowitzki. -- Adam Reisinger

Jackson's consistent success as a coach seemed surreal, as he showed up in the Finals year after year, leading the Bulls and Lakers to the three three-peats (the first since Bill Russell's Celtics) before finally losing in the Finals -- and then tacked on two more titles before retiring from coaching, to go along with the two he won as a player.
Just as otherworldly was his approach to the game. Unlike many other coaches, the ""Zen Master"" believed in guiding players with a light, almost spiritual touch, as spelled out in influential books like ""Sacred Hoops"" and ""More Than a Game.""
Tim Keown captured some of Jackson's magic during Jackson's 10th title run:
""If there's genius in getting out of the way, Jackson has perfected it. I'd make the case that it's a tougher approach to follow because it shifts a huge share of the credit to the players. Obviously, he has had great players, but he's managed to create a system in which the players can excel, then has trusted them to execute it. Does that make him a button pusher or a master of preparation? And, yes, it does help to have a guy like Kobe who can create when the offense breaks down. It also helped Auerbach to have Russell coming from the weak side to deflect shots into the hands of Sam Jones or John Havlicek when the Celtics' defense broke down.
""As former Jackson assistant Jim Cleamons told The New York Times, 'Every situation that Phil has coached in, the team hadn't won before he got there. That, too, is a fact.'"" -- Royce Webb

Riley's reach across the decades has shaped and reshaped the NBA. After his career as a role player and a short stint as a broadcaster, Riley took over the Showtime Lakers and led them to four championships, quickly gaining popularity as a stylish sideline manager -- indeed ""The Winner Within"" is one of the most successful sports-based management books ever.
But Riley wasn't the run-and-gun coach many assumed, as he proved in his next stop: New York City, where as coach and GM he put together one of the most rugged defensive squads ever seen. Riley's Knicks were beloved locally and despised by rivals -- Phil Jackson accused them of playing football, not basketball. But the Knicks' physical, all-defense approach was extremely influential, contributing to a subsequent decline in NBA scoring and fan appeal.
By then, Riley was already off to his current destination: Miami, where as an executive and sometimes-coach he has led the Heat to three titles. His major innovation in Miami might be his most enduring, as he was the architect of the NBA's most infamous superteam, starring LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, who shocked the league by using free agency to team up and win two titles in four Finals appearances, thereby encouraging other stars to join forces to have fun and chase championships. -- Webb

SHAQ!
Just the man's name evokes a sense of glee. O'Neal's massive, media-friendly, hyperbolic personality and dozens of nicknames found their way into movies, albums and commercials at a pace unlike any seen before in the NBA, and he remains a household presence on TNT.
The hard brevity of ""Shaq!"" is also a reminder of his powerful, overwhelming presence on the court. Despite just one MVP trophy, he earned his self-awarded Most Dominant Ever moniker, and he was without a doubt the most physically imposing player of his generation.
His agility and ability at his size made every team lust for a player like Shaq, even with his memorably poor free throw shooting and occasional brushes with teammates. Ultimately, O'Neal's three consecutive titles and Finals MVPs demonstrated that he reached a level of inside devastation that might never be seen again in an NBA evolving away from interior play. -- Harris

Originally from Nigeria, Olajuwon played center with grace, quickness and overwhelming talent on each end, making him a unique figure in the NBA's evolution. In the post, his moves -- particularly the Dream Shake -- showed players of all sizes the kind of footwork and agility possible and made him more than a match for the great centers of his day, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing and Shaquille O'Neal among them.
As a former member of the Phi Slama Jama ""fraternity"" at the University of Houston, and alongside his Twin Tower Ralph Sampson, Olajuwon took the Houston Rockets to the NBA Finals in his second season. As an individual talent, he was astounding -- he posted a quadruple-double, led the league in rebounds and blocks, and was a perennial All-NBA and All-Defense selection -- even as Sampson and the Rockets faltered.
Team glory was secured during 1994 and 1995 as Olajuwon took his game to new heights. With a renewed dedication to his Islamic faith, he became the first foreign-born player to win MVP and also was named Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year. To date, he is the only player to win all three awards in the same season. In 1995, he led the underdog sixth-seeded Rockets back to the title, defeating four teams that had won 57 games or more, a challenge no champion has faced before or since. -- Harris

Garnett's legacy is secure for any number of reasons.
The first thing to truly set him apart: He was the first player in 20 years to go straight to the NBA from high school without enrolling in college -- a decision that has helped make him the highest-earning player in NBA history and a role model for Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and dozens more.
His game-changing ability -- particularly on defense, for which he made 12 All-Defensive teams -- was constantly apparent in Minnesota, where the Timberwolves still haven't made a postseason trip since 2004, the year he won the MVP award and three years before Garnett initially left the franchise via trade.
That deal would alter the course of the NBA, enabling Boston -- who also acquired Ray Allen that year -- to make the biggest single-season improvement in league history and win the 2008 NBA championship.
Even from a style and cultural standpoint, Garnett is still relevant: His fiery intensity remains legendary, as demonstrated by his trendsetting move of jumping to block jumpers after the whistle, intended to intimidate and break the confidence of opponents. And Garnett is a regular on TNT's broadcast from his ""Area 21"" set. -- Chris Herring

Where do you start with Charles Barkley?
First, with his play on the court, which is occasionally forgotten but is the foundation of his appeal: An 11-time NBA All-Star for the Philadelphia 76ers, Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets, the 1993 MVP led the Suns to their last NBA Finals appearance 25 years ago. Barkley was also a Dream Teamer (and pal of Michael Jordan) who ran roughshod in the Olympics, and he averaged 22.1 points, 11.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists for his NBA career.
At just over 6-foot-4, he played power forward with incredible speed, power and skill. He was an unstoppable force, whether on the break or on the boards, and he could pass and score. His signature rampaging dunks still show up on NBA highlight reels, and he was remorseless in delivering hard fouls. For years, every short power forward was compared to Barkley, known as ""The Round Mound of Rebound"" for his physique.
What ultimately has made Barkley a game-changer is his personality, his voice. He has starred on TNT's ""Inside the NBA"" for years, and is outspoken on racial issues and every other topic that comes to mind. As perhaps the most popular sports broadcaster of today, Barkley is entertaining whether he's saying something provocative, hurling an insult or dropping a hilarious or self-deprecating line.
The Hall of Famer once said, ""I am not a role model,"" in a Nike commercial. But he is the forerunner of today's more outspoken players, and that makes him one of the game-changers of the NBA's past three and a half decades. -- Marc J. Spears

""We're talking about practice. Not a game. Not a game. Practice."" When you think about Allen Iverson, his prized, hilarious quote from May 7, 2002, certainly has to come to mind.
But there are so many answers to why ""The Answer"" was a game changer. At just 6-feet, Iverson was still one of the most dynamic scorers in NBA history -- more relentless and improvisational than refined, and able to get buckets on fast-break dunks, impossible layups and jumpers from any spot on the floor. Iverson led the league in scoring four times and steals three times, and those skills went hand in hand, as he gambled and scored fearlessly.
In the halfcourt, the crossover was his signature move, most memorably against Michael Jordan and Tyronn Lue, when he scored on Lue in the Finals and stepped over him. As Steve Kerr told Chris Haynes, ""The crossover, in my mind, changed the way players played. Before Iverson, his move was a carry, and guys had to keep their hand on top of the ball. So he was groundbreaking with that move because it was a hesitation into the crossover that nobody had really done before.""
Just as influential was how Iverson, the league's MVP in 2000-01 and an 11-time All-Star, popularized hip-hop culture and a new look in the NBA. His braids, tattoos, chains and oversized jerseys set the fashion standard in his day and thrilled a generation of young fans. They also turned off some fans, and Iverson certainly played a role in the NBA instituting a dress code in 2005. But the ex-Georgetown star guard also received a lifetime contract from Reebok. -- Spears

Kobe Bryant followed in the footsteps of Michael Jordan, but he was also a maverick -- a brilliant, driven talent who made his own path and got tens of millions of fans to follow.
Bryant's 1996 announcement from his high school gym that he was headed to the NBA came when that was still considered a brash move, but when the Lakers traded for him at the draft, stardom seemed assured. And stardom did follow quickly, as Bryant was voted the youngest All-Star starter in history even before he was a Lakers starter.
As a young player, Bryant had a knack for blowing minds on the court with spectacular basket forays and annoying traditionalists with his self-centered play, later known as Hero Ball. But he formed an uneasy alliance with Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson to win three straight NBA titles, giving Bryant the superstardom and success he craved.
In 2003, Bryant was charged with sexual assault in Colorado -- the charge was eventually dropped when the accuser declined to testify, Bryant issued an apology and the parties settled a civil suit out of court.
By this time, Bryant was developing a reputation as not only a great clutch shooter but a gritty, intense player -- a persona he would call Black Mamba, inspired by a character in Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" films. This aspect of his personality led to clashes with O'Neal, and their feud contributed to O'Neal's departure in a trade to Miami, making Bryant the sole face of the Lakers. In 2007, after the Lakers failed to build a contender, he angrily requested a trade, but reversed course after the Lakers acquired Pau Gasol in 2008 and won titles in 2009 and 2010, declaring himself a Laker for life.
Kobe created a devoted cult of fans that often seemed to care more about him, his jerseys and his shoes than his team. And his fan base cuts across many cultures and nationalities in the U.S. and around the world, particularly China. Over his 20-year career, all in a Laker uniform, Bryant's game evolved and his mastery of the finer points of the game increased -- he became one of the most skilled players in NBA history. But more than any particular accomplishment, it was his personality that seemed most magnetic and influential.
As Ramona Shelburne wrote: ""He traded everything -- his friends, his family, his identity, his body, ultimately his humanity -- in pursuit of basketball immortality. His entire career was built upon accepting nothing. After he ruptured his Achilles, he looked Lakers trainer Gary Vitti in the eye and asked whether he could still play. When he tore his right rotator cuff, he just started shooting left-handed. Vitti and Lakers coach Byron Scott had to yank him out of the game. When questioned why he'd do such a thing, he defiantly responded, 'Why? God gave us two hands.'"" -- Webb

Though West is best known to many later-generation fans as a swashbuckling front office executive who presided over the Lakers' dynasty of the 1980s, he was the defining combo guard of his time, a natural to serve as the silhouette for the NBA's iconic logo.
""Basketball is, and always has been, a huge, huge part of me, the canvas I tried to paint each time I stepped on the court and never stopped trying to perfect,"" West wrote in his autobiography ""West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life,"" published in 2011.
West was a paragon of consistent excellence who was an All-Star in each of his 14 seasons, and helped guide the Lakers to nine Finals appearances. West's jumper -- its economy, quick release, silky follow-through -- made him the league's most efficient shooter during his prime. On the other end, West was a rugged, handsy competitor, whose defensive crouch and laser focus tormented opposing guards. --  Arnovitz

The sports bar debate has been settled.
""He's the greatest shooter to ever step on the court,"" Warriors teammate Kevin Durant said during the preseason.
He leads all guards in career true shooting percentage (by a considerable margin), and all guards who started a majority of their career games in 3-point percentage. Yet Curry's supremacy as a shooter transcends the ledger: He also changed the definition of what constitutes a quality shot from the field in an NBA game.
Fans across the nation line up hours before tipoff to get a glimpse of his warm-up routine. In live games, Curry's unconscionable pull-ups from ungodly distances, his step-backs under extreme heat, bombs that materialize out of nowhere thanks to his handles and lightning-quick release -- all of them nearly impossible or entirely ill-advised for most NBA shooters, but high-percentage looks for the two-time NBA champion and Most Valuable Player.
Curry will go down as not only the avatar of the NBA's Golden Age of Shooting, but as the inspiration for generations of kids who see him as the model for how to refine their skills and overcome bigger, more athletic players. -- Arnovitz

Larry Bird seemed like a fictional character come to life, ""the Hick from French Lick"" who arrived in Boston to turn the Celtics and indeed the entire NBA around. Along with his rival Magic Johnson, who played a much glitzier style of ball in Los Angeles, Bird brought a beautiful game featuring ball movement back to a league that had lost favor with fans.
Bird's shooting prowess and command of the game became the standards for new generations to follow. He passed better than any forward before him, but he could also score on anyone, or any team, and would tell them about it before and after. His 1988 Game 7 duel with Dominique Wilkins and the Hawks -- won by Bird and the Celtics, naturally -- is the stuff of legend.
To note that he won national college player of the year, three MVP awards, three NBA titles and a gold medal as an aging member of the Dream Team seems almost beside the point. But the honors did arrive at a furious pace in his relatively brief playing career, and he is the only player in NBA history to win Rookie of the Year, MVP, Finals MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year, the latter two for his work with his home-state Indiana Pacers.
Despite his Hoosier State roots, Bird will forever be associated with Celtic Green. As Jackie MacMullan wrote, ""He epitomized qualities the city of Boston loves: fearless, gritty, arrogant, passionate and relentless. Bird won three championships but could have easily had a handful more had his teammates matched his intensity ... and if his body hadn't so cruelly betrayed him in his final years. One of Boston's best clutch athletes of all time."" -- Webb

Dr. J set the standard for NBA style, combining originality, huge hands, hang time and elegance to show future generations the kind of artistry possible in basketball. But as much as the Doctor has been praised for his highlight dunks, cool personality, voluminous afro and flair that carried the ABA and NBA for almost two decades, his actual play is still undervalued.
That's crazy to say that about a 16-time All-Star who still is recognized by fans who weren't even alive when he retired. But check this: The man scored over 30,000 points, grabbed over 10,000 rebounds and dished out over 5,000 assists. And he was a freelancing terror off the ball, pilfering over 2,000 steals and racking up nearly 2,000 blocks. Without those well-rounded skills, he might be remembered as a circus act.
Sure, appreciate the sinuous finger rolls, the effortless cradle-rocking dunks, and the soaring free-throw-line slam that left humanity bewildered in 1976. But all the style in the world doesn't get you four MVPs and three championships. The man had game, on and off the court. -- Harris

The triple-double. That's always where you start with Robertson. He had 181 triple-doubles in his career, an NBA record. Over the course of his first five seasons, he averaged 30.3 points, 10.6 assists and 10.4 rebounds, numbers that seem absurd now. But leave behind the triple-double.
The Big O was the first guard to shoot 50 percent for a season and the first player to average over 10 assists per game. He won back-to-back high school titles in basketball-crazy Indiana. He won Olympic gold in 1960. He was MVP in 1964 and NBA champion in 1971. But we're still not precisely there on why Oscar Robertson is foundational to basketball history.
As the third president of the NBPA and a civil rights activist, Robertson fought for over a decade to secure pensions and free agency for players. His antitrust lawsuit, Robertson v. NBA, destroyed the reserve clause that tied a player to an NBA team in perpetuity.
That clause's annihilation and the free agency that sprung from its ashes now shapes the modern economic and labor structure of the NBA. LeBron James' decision, ESPN's coverage of every summer's free-agent bonanza, and the NBA's own promotion of blockbuster signings and trades depended on Robertson's steadfast refusal to accept the unfair status quo. -- Harris

The magnitude of Abdul-Jabbar's prolific contributions to basketball, both as player and citizen, are unparalleled. He's the NBA's all-time leading scorer, a six-time champion and most valuable player, and he patented the skyhook.

""I don't have any delusions that I'm shining a bright light through the political and social jungle to guide our way, but I do hope that I'm adding some value to the national discussion and maybe helping people understand the causes of our polarity and how we might make things a little better,"" Abdul-Jabbar told Smithsonian magazine in 2016.

Chamberlain set a slew of records, some of which will never be broken. And that's not including the 100-point game, which someone could conceivably top one day. The 55-rebound game? That one's untouchable. Averaging 50 points a game for a season? Unreachable. Playing 48.5 minutes a game for an entire season. Yes, that's longer than a regulation 48-minute game, so obviously that's not being broken either.
But those are the individual numbers that feed into the superficial Russell vs. Chamberlain debate that always depended on simply seeing Wilt as selfish.
Well, Chamberlain had a penchant for shattering team records, too. In 1967, when his 76ers won the NBA title, they set a record at 68 wins in the process. In 1972, when his Lakers won the title, they set a new record of 69 wins total and a 33-game win streak that is the standard in all of professional sports.
But it was Chamberlain's spectacular persona that mattered as much as his accomplishments. His mindblowing athletic talent -- including overpowering strength, an outlandish wingspan, supreme speed, and uncanny leaping ability -- and outgoing personality gave him a presence unlike any in sports. As an actor, singer, track star, nightclub owner, boxer, and volleyball enthusiast he elevated his own profile and the NBA's. -- Harris

The greatest winner in American team sports. That says it all, but not everything.
With 11 NBA titles -- the last two as the first black coach in pro sports -- plus back-to-back NCAA titles, and an Olympic gold medal, Russell has an untouchable track record of team success.
Individually he was a savant. Never a great scorer, he was nonetheless a great offensive player. Few centers have passed the ball as well as Russell and he was the first player to turn the dunk into a routine weapon. And of course his shot-blocking revolutionized how teams played defense. Obviously shots were blocked before Russell, but he turned the act into a psychologically and physically devastating art form.
So, that's Russell the winner. Russell the activist is somehow more extraordinary. It was not lost on him that days after speaking in the Oval Office with President Eisenhower he was denied service at gas stations and restaurants because he was black. From the 1950s to the present, he gave interviews, wrote articles and books, and now is on Twitter addressing the flaws of American society. Racism, police brutality, poverty, bigotry, exploitation: He has made those topics a central focus for over 60 years and shows no sign of letting up. -- Harris

Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson and Larry Bird -- first as hated rivals, then as friends -- did more than any other pair of players to bring the NBA into the modern era we still enjoy today. It's often said, glibly, that they saved the NBA.
And as the leader of the Showtime Lakers, Johnson won five championships and became the ebullient face of the league for many. His dazzling passing at 6-foot-9 thrilled NBA fans as nothing before had done. And now he's trying to bring a whole new Laker generation to fruition as team president.
When Johnson turned 50, J.A. Adande captured the essence of his impact:
""He has celebrated almost 18 birthdays -- the equivalent of a legal coming-of-age -- since that Nov. 7, 1991, news conference in which he announced he was HIV-positive. In those early days of AIDS awareness we did not think he would make it to 40, let alone to 50. But the science was moving ahead of the society. It was the dawn of a new age of advances in treatment -- drug ""cocktails"" followed by protease inhibitors and antiretroviral therapy -- I recall a family friend who was HIV-positive who had to completely readjust his mindset, from bracing for death to figuring out what to do with the rest of his life. Johnson never needed an adjustment. From the beginning, he vowed he was ""going to beat the disease,"" and with the help of drugs, diet and exercise he has.
""In many ways his accomplishments after learning he had the virus are greater than the five NBA championships and one NCAA championship he won before then: winning an Olympic gold medal, opening movie theaters and restaurants in underserved urban areas across the country, watching his kids grow up, buying an ownership stake in the Los Angeles Lakers, even fulfilling his dream of hosting a talk show. (Some things went better than others.)
""We're into the second generation of his influence now, the players who grew up watching the players who grew up watching Magic, something that didn't dawn on me until I asked 24-year-old Trevor Ariza about Johnson and he said, ""Baron looks up to him a lot, and I look up to Baron."" The notion that there are adults without a direct recollection of Johnson in his prime is jarring to those of us who were around to see it. To Johnson, it's actually reassuring, a sign of lasting impact, the closest thing to immortality."" -- Webb

The list of James' accomplishments since entering the league are well known, but he's continuing to write his story and refine his legacy. In what portends to be a significant achievement, sometime next year James should become the first player in history to be in the top 10 all time in both points and assists. That's a distinction that will carry a great honor for him as he has always wanted to be known as a playmaker and not just as a scorer. He has a chance to move into the top 50 all time in total rebounds next season as well. In the playoffs, he's already the all-time leader in scoring, second in steals and third in assists.

Jordan transformed the style and substance of basketball, expanding the scope and meaning of athletic achievement. We still see his influence in ways big and small: kids wagging their tongues; the raging popularity of basketball in China; post-up players leaning backward into defenders before making their move.
But for all his huge dunks, fresh kicks and clutch shots, Jordan's biggest impact came off the court as he empowered athletes -- especially African-Americans -- to obtain full economic participation in the billions generated by their labor. Starting with Air Jordan sneakers, which led to his own Jordan Brand, which led to him buying majority control of the Charlotte Hornets, Jordan blazed a trail for athletes to escape the plantation, buy the Big House, and sit on the porch with their feet up, smoking a cigar.
Today, it's normal for Ronaldo to own hotels, gyms and shampoo. We expect Jay-Z to be ""a business, man."" We don't blink when Kobe and LeBron launch their own movie studios. Jordan created that template.
And yes, it must have been the shoes.

LeBron James led the Cavaliers to four straight victories and dunked all over opponents, but Anthony Davis is nipping at the King's heels in this week's NBA player rankings. (1:45)
LeBron James became a millionaire two weeks before his high school graduation when he inked an endorsement deal with Upper Deck that included a $1 million signing bonus.
But he earned bigger money six months earlier on a frigid night in December when he delivered in the most pressure-packed moment of his career to that point -- a game against No. 1-ranked Oak Hill Academy broadcast live on ESPN2. He finished with 31 points, 16 rebounds and 6 assists -- fairly standard for him in high school -- and somehow managed to exceed unprecedented expectations.
Before that moment, he was a curiosity. Afterward, he was a bona fide commodity. It was James' first truly game-changing moment.
He has had a few more since then, indeed, but few have been as indelible as Dec. 12, 2002. It was a huge event in James' life and a central feature in both a book and a documentary about his senior year of high school.
It was the first time ESPN had televised a high school basketball game in 13 years, wrapped with pregame and postgame coverage, a feature at halftime and the cover story of ESPN The Magazine that week.

We're counting down the 100 most influential players in NBA history.

Dan Shulman, Dick Vitale, Bill Walton and Jay Bilas were on hand to call the game, which got more than 1.5 million viewers, the second most in ESPN2's history at the time. Many came to watch James fail, to flip the channel and declare him a product of hype. Instead, in the first half, James was slamming home dunks and throwing mind-numbing passes that elicited ""Are you serious?"" screams from Vitale.
The highlights that game created were replayed around the globe, and James' star went white hot. That evening was probably the basis for the seven-year, $100 million deal he got from Nike the following spring. James was always going to receive an impressive shoe deal, but after that night, competing companies decided they had to have him. Just three weeks later, for example, Nike founder Phil Knight flew to watch James in person to amp up the recruiting.
It wasn't the largest endorsement deal of all time, but that nine-figure wager from Nike (Reebok was right there with them in the bidding) on an 18-year-old before the NBA even held its draft lottery that year remains one of the most remarkable deals in the history of American sports. James changed the paradigm for what a basketball prodigy was, and there still hasn't been anyone quite like him since.

LeBron's back threatened to betray him. Then a former Navy SEAL went to work and gave him new strength.
LeBron James said the fact that he was able to notch his career-best 14th triple-double of the season at age 33 is a credit to him getting ""better with age,"" not to the faster pace of today's NBA.
Yes, ""The Decision"" broadcast was panned for its poor taste, but the concept has aged well. Players now routinely take control of announcing their big career decisions and craft essays to explain themselves. James' personal essay in Sports Illustrated when he returned to Cleveland in 2014 came four months before The Players' Tribune launched as a platform for professional athletes.

In 2012, when James and Dwyane Wade organized their Miami Heat teammates to pose for a team photo in hoodies after the death of Trayvon Martin, it changed the way NBA players used social media.
Ranking anyone in a category as nebulous as ""game-changer"" is inherently challenging because the games have so much nuance to them, and personality, talent and charisma intersect at so many angles. James has been called many things in his life and launched as many arguments as he has 3-point shots.
On this topic, though, there's little need for debate. James' status as a game-changer is undisputed.

April crept up fast, didn’t it? College basketball season is over, the NBA playoffs aren’t far away, and draft season only intensifies from here. We’re just a week away from the NCAA’s 11:59 p.m. April 10 deadline for underclassmen to declare for the draft, and dozens of prospects have already done so. There’s still time for the NBA standings to fluctuate, but the picture has clarified and only gets more intriguing from here. Given the circumstances, the Front Office is expanding its Mock Draft to include two rounds and all 60 picks for the first time this season.
The pre-draft process begins in earnest next week at the Portsmouth Invitational, a proving ground for the top college seniors each year. There’s plenty that can still change in a week, and a number of underclassmen are facing difficult decisions on whether to declare and test the waters. We’ve seen one likely first-rounder, Arkansas center Daniel Gafford, return to school with eyes on what will be a much thinner 2019 draft class, and it’s likely more players in similar boats will follow suit. After Monday's title game, one prospect to monitor is Villanova sophomore Donte DiVincenzo, who picked a great time to have a career night. DiVincenzo was largely seen as a quality prospect for the 2019 draft, but may be forcing the issue after dropping 31 points in the NCAA title game.
As always, this Mock Draft serves to assess what the big picture looks like on a given day, whereas our Big Board serves as the Front Office’s own assessment of available talent. Below, you’ll find projections for all 60 picks, allotted based on the reverse order of the current standings, with tiebreakers done at random. (All stats through April 2).

This would be an ideal marriage, given Phoenix’s biggest need is in the middle and that Ayton is plenty familiar with Arizona. The Wildcats’ swift tournament exit exposed what he has to improve defensively, but it doesn’t change the fact that he’s the best prospect in the draft. Ayton will arrive as one of the most athletically gifted bigs in the league and would pair with Devin Booker to give the Suns two high-end young pieces to build around. With a lot of talent already in the fold, nabbing Ayton atop the draft would signal a clear direction—and usher in added urgency to start winning.

As a down year winds to a close, the Grizzlies are at a bit of a crossroads, given Mike Conley and Marc Gasol are still dangerous when healthy and the latter is presently unsettled. This is a terrific fit for Doncic, whose size, feel and developed skill set would slot right in to help engineer a turnaround. His greatest strength is his on-court intelligence, and while he may not evolve into a dominant scorer, lessening that pressure while placing him alongside other great passers should bring out the best in him.

The Hawks aren’t tied down to much of anything on their roster beyond John Collins, and are in search of a foundational player. Jackson’s ability to space the floor and protect the rim makes for an ideal fit, and would give Atlanta a great interior duo. Although he wasn’t maximized at Michigan State and ended the season in a slump, Jackson really helped himself overall. While displaying a greater offensive skill level than expected, he also made a tangible defensive impact (5.5 blocks per 40 minutes). He needs to mature physically and mentally and is probably a few years away from being able to anchor a winning team, but Atlanta has time to let him grow.
Height: 7'0"" | Weight: 225 | Age: 19 | Last: 4Stats: 12.9 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 3.7 BPG
Expect the Magic to lean toward long-term upside and projection with this pick. There’s no questioning Bamba’s insane defensive potential given his length and mobility. His 7’9” wingspan and 9’6” standing reach are true rarities. Bamba’s rudimentary offensive game is a riskier bet, but he may only need to be a DeAndre Jordan-type lob threat to be immensely valuable. He has shown potential shooting jumpers and is more skilled than he was able to show at Texas. Chief concerns from NBA teams have centered on competitiveness and playing hard, which he can help address during the pre–draft process.
Height: 6'10"" | Weight: 235 | Age: 19 | Last: 5Stats: 21.0 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 61.4% FG
Should Bagley fall here he’d offer strong value, and would be a fascinating frontcourt complement to Dennis Smith in Dallas. He was picked apart by critics as the season went on, but Bagley’s athleticism, offensive potential and rebounding ability give him a strong upside. He can be a ball-watcher on defense and his interior play can be predictable, but at some point there’s no sense looking past his production. Bagley’s best NBA position is probably going to be power forward, but he will need to keep improving as a jump shooter to make that happen. He’s still a very good prospect, and deserves some patience.

After taking a risk on Harry Giles last year, the Kings may wind up in position to make a similar decision if Porter is available. He did not look mobile or totally comfortable on the court in his brief end-of-season return, but there is reward to be had given his substantial talent scoring the ball. His size, shooting ability and polished offensive game should keep him pretty safely among the draft’s early selections, but there have always been questions about his ability to make others better as well as his defensive makeup. Expect his camp to carefully control which teams receive what medical information pertaining to his back.

Whatever LeBron decides, Carter’s blend of offensive skill and rim protection gives the Cavs a desirable piece to build around. He solidified himself as a top–10 pick in most scouts’ eyes with an impressively consistent freshman year, despite playing more around the high post and outside with Marvin Bagley stationed on the low block. His game has no major weakness beyond a lack of quick vertical lift, and he should be able to extend his shooting range to the perimeter, where his passing ability and feel will stand out. He’s a terrific rebounder and has a good sense of defensive positioning, as well. Carter is a safe bet to have a long, useful career.
Height: 6'2"" | Weight: 180 | Age: 19 | Last: 9Stats: 27.4 PPG, 8.8 APG, 36.1% 3FG
Although Kris Dunn took a step forward for the Bulls this season, Young would bring a different level of playmaking and perimeter scoring that makes sense to add to the backcourt mix. His highs and lows were well-documented this season, but his talent is enticing enough that he probably shouldn’t slip too far. The Bulls’ athletic, perimeter-oriented core guys could benefit from playing off a passer like Young, and he wouldn’t be overburdened with a huge scoring load in turn. His upside should be a reasonable gamble.

New York will end up looking hard at the available wings in this range, and Bridges is the safest among them as a plus defender and improved perimeter scorer. His ability to space the floor and guard multiple positions makes him an easy theoretical fit in any lineup. Creating his own shot off the dribble is a weakness, but he should be able to step in and help right away as the Knicks continue to assemble parts around Kristaps Porzingis. His major role in Villanova’s title run certainly doesn’t hurt when it comes to visibility.

Bridges finished the season on an inarguable low note, struggling to score from anywhere on the floor against Syracuse’s 2–3 zone. He makes sense alongside Philly’s core group with his energy and ability to run the floor, but the questions about his distance shooting and ability to create for himself are still significant. If he steps up his defensive effort, and gains consistency with his stroke it can work, but he will most likely need to evolve into more of a glue guy than the finesse scorer we saw in college.

The Hornets reportedly offered their GM job to Mitch Kupchak this week. Until it’s clear who’s running the show, it’s tough to really chart their draft course. A malleable talent like Knox, who’s still learning the game, would be a useful building block for the long-term. He had an up-and-down season, but overall he took steps forward and his scoring touch, three-point shooting potential and physical tools give teams a lot to work with. Knox may not progress into a star, but he’s far from a defined product and should be able to play both forward spots. There are a number of paths for him to become a useful rotation player.

Sexton’s late-season performance was a good reminder of his strengths, and it’s certainly possible he ends up the first guard drafted depending on how the lottery shakes out. He’s a gifted downhill scorer who was tough to stop when locked in, though his effort level wavered a good amount during the season. That said, Sexton is a useful defender when he wants to be. There is some concern about the selfish nature of his game and whether he makes teammates better. If he puts it all together, he’ll become a useful player. The Clippers have a glut of ball-handlers to make decisions on, but at this point in the draft, Sexton would be the best piece available.
Height: 6'9"" | Weight: 240 | Age: 20 | Last: 18Stats: 10.4 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 2.6 BPG
The Clippers could end up picking back–to–back here if they miss the playoffs. Williams is a gifted athlete who plays above the rim naturally, and when he’s competing he’s a load for opponents on the glass. He’s clearly an NBA talent. The issue is that he’s never really done it consistently, which teams view as a risk factor. The team fit wasn’t ideal at Texas A&M, and it doesn’t hurt that he finished the season with several nice showings. If he ends up in a good team environment Williams could provide a great return in this range.
Height: 6'6"" | Weight: 180 | Age: 19 | Last: 13Stats: 14.4 PPG, 5.1 APG, 1.6 SPG
Gilgeous-Alexander helped himself in the eyes of the NBA as much as anyone in the month of March, leading Kentucky to an SEC tournament title and what was a disappointing exit in the Sweet 16. He’s a crafty finisher with a good sense of pace and his size, length and instincts are all appealing. His shooting is a work in progress but his potential as a defender and playmaker is substantial. Gilgeous-Alexander would complement Jamal Murray and Gary Harris nicely in theory.

Musa provides some shooting and slashing ability and is a legit perimeter threat at 6’9”. As one of the younger players available, he’s put together a good résumé overseas. He’s extremely skilled offensively and known as an intense competitor, and scouts say he is highly motivated to make the NBA. The Suns should have three first-round picks (and just two contracts coming off the books) and could choose to keep him overseas in this scenario.
(*via Bucks)Height: 6'7"" | Weight: 215 | Age: 18 | Last: 16Stats: 11.3 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 1.6 SPG
The Suns appear likely to get this pick from the Bucks (it has to fall between 11 and 16 to convey), which would give them three of the first 20 selections. Brown’s size, ability to play on the ball and defensive versatility would make sense next to Devin Booker, but he needs added seasoning. His shot-creating ability and his jumper need work, but the tools should play at the next level even if he’s unlikely to become a go-to option. Prospects with his perimeter skill set are in demand right now.

Should Walker fall this far, he’d be a terrific value as a lottery-type talent in the mid-first round. There’s a case for him to stay in school and push to lock up a lottery selection in 2019. A talented but inexperienced slasher, Walker has substantial upside, but a long way to go. He can bully his way to the basket and elevate for difficult finishes, but doesn’t have a great feel for picking his spots or finding teammates. He needs to become more consistent and commit further to playing defense, but there’s a lot to work with here. The Wizards could groom him as a third guard to start.

It’s unclear if Hachimura will enter the draft, but if he tests the waters he should expect to find heavy first-round interest. He finished the season strong, but didn’t have quite the breakout some expected (though his numbers really pop on a per-minute basis). Hachimura’s combination of strength, length and explosiveness will play in the NBA, and though he’s somewhat of a project he has rotation-level upside. Able to play both forward spots, he’d be a sensible investment for Chicago here.

Simons announced he will forgo college and enter the draft with an agent straight out of his prep year at IMG, and also withdrew from the Hoop Summit and Jordan Brand Classic. He will make his case as a prospect while riding a degree of mystery, and his camp will presumably schedule his team workouts carefully. Simons has a lot of intriguing traits, with great explosiveness, speed and developing three-point range, but obviously lacks high-level experience. He’s full of potential as a scorer, but untested and a long-term project. The Hawks will likely have three first-rounders, and can focus on getting Simons the G League reps he needs.

Once Robinson gets into team workouts we’ll have a much better read on his situation, but he’s highly athletic and physically jumps off the page with a 7’3” wingspan. There have been plenty of questions about his feel for the game, and skipping his freshman year at Western Kentucky and taking a season off didn’t help. His draft range is wide, but his tools are first-round caliber. The Jazz could take a shot on upside, and have room to develop another big behind Rudy Gobert.

Hutchison had a prolific season at Boise State and won’t have to handle as heavy an offensive load in the NBA. He’s got a good build, rebounds and passes well and could potentially even spend time as a small-ball four. The question is how well he’ll shoot from deep (35.2% this season), and how much offense he can create for himself against defenders who eliminate his athletic mismatch. Hutchison isn’t a creative scorer, but he’s a good cutter without the ball and should offer a level of role versatility. His experience and physical readiness make sense for a Minnesota group pushing to be competitive sooner than later.

After arriving at Texas Tech as an unheralded recruit, Smith’s emergence was quite the surprise, and averaging more than a block and a steal per game as a true freshman for a quality team was no small feat. The platform of the Red Raiders’ Elite 8 run certainly helped Smith from an NBA perspective, and his impressive quick-twitch athleticism and overall instincts give him a decent base. He can’t create much, if any, of his own offense right now, which adds a level of risk. But he’ll have a chance at the first round based on potential if he comes out. The Spurs would be able to get the most out of him.

The Pacers could use a ball-handler, and Holiday separated himself from the pack somewhat with a strong senior year. He’s a generally solid player, offering precise distance shooting, poise, toughness and feel for using ball screens. His lack of size and issues getting downhill off the dribble likely cap his upside, but he defends well, can score and should receive an off-court bonus given his older brothers have both been successful pros. Holiday isn’t a swing for the fences, but can help address a need for someone as a backup guard.

Thomas was consistently a plus for Creighton and emerged as one of the better on-ball defenders in college basketball this season, while also hitting threes at a strong clip. In Philly, he’s a nice backcourt fit with Ben Simmons, potentially a plus cover on opposing point guards and also a floor-spacing threat. He’s not a creative scorer, which may limit his overall upside, but has a nice floor given his athletic ability and 3-and-D skill set. He would make situational sense as a role player in this spot.

Though it’s uncertain at the moment if Fernando will enter his name in the draft, scouts are enamored with his athletic tools and he’ll find himself getting late first-round consideration if he does. He’s unusually mobile and strong, competes hard and has a higher skill level than he displayed this season in a supporting role at Maryland. Physical two-way rim-runners are in demand, and Fernando would give the Lakers some controllable depth on the inside as a potential backup.

It was a lost season for Brown, who missed all of February and March after foot surgery and didn’t make the type of strides you’d like to see from a 21-year-old sophomore. He regressed greatly as a shooter (26.7% from deep) and profiles more as a combo guard than a point. Still, his gritty defense and athleticism are strong points that lend themselves to an NBA role, and the Blazers could use a tough, hard-nosed player to add to their backcourt. He’s entering the draft without an agent.

Amid a challenging year for Arizona, Alkins made the best of a tough situation after breaking his foot in the preseason. He never appeared to be at full strength, and should end up in better shape entering the pre-draft process. Alkins’s strong frame, explosiveness and motor make him an interesting prospect on the wing. Proving himself defensively and adding consistency to his jumper will help.

There’s a sense around the league that Robinson has played his way into the late first round: he was the ACC’s top scoring guard, creates well off the dribble and can put the ball in the basket from all three levels. He plays with a unique change of speeds off the bounce, and solidified himself as a legitimate prospect with a breakout year. His intangibles and ability to play on and off the ball are appealing, and he’d give the Nets another piece to play with in the backcourt.

Regardless of how dominant Villanova was in sealing the national title, Brunson should have already endeared himself to teams given his otherworldly feel and well-rounded offensive game. He’s not an elite athlete, but he’s going to make teammates better, pick his spots offensively and bring leadership. He won’t lock down NBA ballhandlers, but understands team defense and should be able to make it work. Brunson may be the best of the mid-draft point guard crop, and the late first round is within reach.

The Hawks will pick three times in the first round and have a great opportunity to replenish their talent base. Graham is viewed as a safe bet to be a useful ball-handler, though not a star. His production was consistent at Kansas, although he shot just 39.2% on two-point shots and struggles to finish at the rim sometimes. Leading the Jayhawks to the Final Four was a nice boost to his résumé. As Atlanta rebuilds, and with Dennis Schröder’s future unclear, adding a steadying presence to the backcourt makes sense.

Before getting to my column on the NFL, allow me to have a moment of pride for Villanova's second college basketball championship in three years. For those who don’t know, my day job is at Villanova, where I am Executive Director of the Moorad Center or Sports Law at Villanova Law School (our annual symposium, a must on the sports event calendar, is next week). As part of my role I have assisted players in interviewing and selecting agents, and serving as a resource for legal or business issues that arise. In doing so I have seen Jay Wright and his program up close and personal; it is impressive how grounded and focused they are. Jay preaches to stay “humble and hungry,” a mantra they—and the larger Villanova community—live by. Yes, the commercial aspects of these “amateur” sports serving as feeder leagues for pro sports can be frustrating  and hard to jibe with revenues. However watching this run of sustained success at a small college in suburban Philadelphia is inspiring. The team concept is alive and well at Villanova.  
Now on to the NFL, where there are no pretenses that business rules...
My reaction to the offseason drama series “Will he stay or will he go?” featuring Odell Beckham Jr.? Yawn. Wake me up in August if Beckham is still saying he won’t “set foot on the field” for the Giants then. The NFL has the longest offseason in all of major sports. Tough talk by players and agents in March rarely, if ever, has the same vigor in July and August. Wasn’t Le’Veon Bell not going to play under his franchise tag contract last year (or is it this year)? Good luck with that.
Stories like Beckham’s usually play out predictably. Players will, directly or through media sources, threaten varying levels of disobedience to their teams, whether by missing offseason workouts, minicamps or, in extreme cases, training camp. The intent of such threats—this is Agent Playbook 101—is to create enough angst among the front office and/or coaching staff that the team reacts with contract negotiations or a trade. And occasionally, teams panic and succumb to the players’ requests. However, in the vast majority of cases—and there are more of these cases than the media knows —the player returns to his existing team and contract as if nothing ever happened. 
Could Beckham be traded? Sure, there is a chance; there are only a handful of NFL players who are truly untouchable, and I don’t think any wide receiver qualifies. And when Giants ownership left the door open that no one is untouchable, the Beckham trade story, having no real basis in fact, was off and running.
So yes, if a team were to blow the Giants away with a stupid trade offer, Beckham could be had (assuming the new team is also prepared to give him a mega-contract). But beyond the is there a chance? hypothetical, my strong sense is this story will die a slow death and Beckham will be back with the Giants playing on his existing contract. Yawn.
​
The Giants did trade one of their star players, although did so after rewarding him with a mega-contract, illustrating how major contract decisions can backfire upon a coaching change. Jason Pierre-Paul, I am told, did not “fit the system” of the incoming Giants defensive coaching staff and was traded to Tampa Bay, leaving significant cap and cash consequences in his wake.
The Giants gave JPP a four-year deal that paid him $22.5 million in 2017 and now leaves a dead money hole on the Giants cap of $15 million this season while he plays for the Bucs (a salary-cap-101 lesson: a $20 million signing bonus is prorated over four years—$5 million per year—and the unamortized portion accelerates upon a trade). Thus, the Giants’ coaching change cost the team, on one player, $37.5 million of cap and cash allocation for playing one 3–13 season.
As we know JPP was one of several highly paid veterans traded in recent weeks, often for lower-round draft picks. The reasons behind this burst of activity? 1. Better cap management league-wide with fewer teams using large amounts of signing bonus proration (shown above) more having present cap and cash flexibility; 2. Higher values on mid-round draft picks and their four-year cost control, especially compared to the cost inefficiencies of high-salaried veterans and 3. the NFL is a copycat league; the Eagles just won the Super Bowl with the most active general manager in the NFL, “Trader Howie” Roseman.
Due in part to his good timing and in part to strategically leveraging free agency, Ndamokung Suh has won the business of football with now three teams. After record-setting contracts with the Lions and Dolphins (where he wrangled the highest NFL contract ever given to a non-quarterback), Suh now signs a one-year, $14 million contract with the Rams. 
The career and earnings path of Suh and a player that started his career with the Rams, Sam Bradord, are eerily similar. There were the first and second picks in 2010 draft (the last year of “bonus baby” contracts before the new CBA). They both went to college in the Big 12; they were 2010 Offensive and Defensive Rookies of the Year. And their career earnings after 2018 will be shockingly similar, with Suh close to $140 million and Bradford close to $135 million.
As to on the field, Bradford has been injury-ridden yet somehow continues to “win” contractually. As to Suh, his honor roll includes five Pro Bowls, three first-team All-NFL selections and two second-team All-NFL selections. 
Suh and Bradford are surefire first-ballot Hall of Famers in the Business of Football.
The most-discussed outcome from last week’s NFL meetings wasn’t the simplification (or not) of the catch rule. Rather, the lowering the helmet penalty/potential ejection rule has drawn predictable ridicule from fans, media and players concerned about changing the game. With news almost every day about future brain trauma of football players, let’s hold the phone on the outrage here.
The NFL has increased emphasis on player safety—especially to the head—since 2009, a time of Congressional hearings on the topic and the early stages of thousands of concussion lawsuits. And despite some high-profile hiccups where Cam Newton (twice), Case Keenum (with the Rams) and Tom Savage appeared to be playing while obviously compromised, the measures seem to be improving awareness, reporting and safer protocols. This rule continues that priority.
No one knows how many fouls or ejections this new rule will or won’t bring. What we do know, however, is that the NFL, in response to concerns of head safety, has been changing before our eyes for years; this is simply part of the trend. The sport now has scant physical activity from January until August; merely 14 padded practices during the season; and several stages of concussion protocol before return to play. And, oh yes, kickoff returns—the most concussive play in the game—will soon become extinct.  We are at a different time and place with the sport than we were even ten years ago.
The ultimate question with all of this is this: how do you make an inherently violent game safe? Simply, you cannot. But these are adults who have made an informed choice in playing a dangerous sport. The issue is more problematic with our youth, and that discussion is for another column.
It is now clearer than ever that this version of the NFL, the highest level of the sport and a beacon for all other levels to follow, is going to have a different and safer product than at any time in its history. This is not your father’s NFL; no amount of complaining about it will change that.

              Jaren Jackson was Big Ten defensive player of the year and freshman of the year. 
            
            
Jaren Jackson, the Big Ten defensive player of the year as a freshman for Michigan State, is leaving early for the NBA.
""Spartans, this was not an automatic decision,"" he tweeted Monday. ""And honestly, thank you for making it one of the toughest decisions I've ever had to think about. While playing in the NBA was always my dream and desire, I did not know the opportunity would present itself in quite this way. I'm ready to live my dreams and I cannot pass it up.""
Jackson was also the Big Ten freshman of the year, joining former Ohio State star Greg Oden as the only players in conference history to pull off the feat. Coach Tom Izzo expected Jackson to be a one-and-done player.
""It was a difficult decision for him, which is kind of neat,"" Izzo told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ""He made the right decision, no doubt, because he's just going to be too high of a pick. The more I'm hearing, he could go three or four (overall) and the ceiling seems to be five.""
The 6-foot-11, 242-pound Jackson blocked 106 shots, a single-season record for a Spartan, and swatted a Big Ten-best 3.03 shots per game. The forward averaged 10.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and made nearly 40 percent of the 96 3-pointers he attempted. His father, Jaren, played for the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs and had a 431-game career with many teams. His mother, Terri, is the director of operations for the Women's National Basketball Players Association.
Jackson was a key player for a team that won 30 games and the Big Ten title in the regular season. He was very productive despite being limited to an average of 22 minutes a game.
Foul trouble usually kept him on the bench, but that was not the case when the third-seeded Spartans lost to 11th-seeded Syracuse 55-53 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Jackson was 0 for 4 with two points and three fouls in 15 minutes, playing fewer minutes than reserves Ben Carter and Xavier Tillman.
Michigan State star Miles Bridges has already declared for the draft and hired an agent. Nick Ward is submitting his name for consideration, but doesn't plan to sign with an agent while exploring his options.
""If Nick (Ward) comes back, we could be good because Nick can score and we'll have really good guards,"" Izzo said.
If Ward returns, he will lead a team with fellow juniors Cassius Winston and Joshua Langford along with seniors Matt McQuaid and Kenny Goins. Tillman worked his way into the lineup as a freshman and Kyle Ahrens is expected to return as a redshirt junior. The Spartans signed several standouts last fall, including point guard Foster Loyer, Michigan's Mr. Basketball, 6-10 forward Marcus Bingham Jr., 6-7 forward Gabe Brown and 6-8 forward Thomas Kithier.
""We'll need a freshman or two to really step up, but nothing like two years ago when Miles and Nick were freshman,"" Izzo said before looking at this year's Final Four, which included Villanova, Kansas, Loyola-Chicago and rival Michigan. ""Villanova has mastered the ability to get old and stay old. If you look at four teams that were left, all had veterans. Next season, we'll have veterans.""

              Final Four hero Arike Ogunbowale graces the cover of SI after leading Notre Dame to the title
            
            
With two shots in a span of 48 hours, Notre Dame junior guard Arike Ogunbowale cemented her name amongst college basketball's greatest performers ever.
Ogunbowale's buzzer-beating shot in the national semifinal sent favorite and undefeated UConn home after a 91–89 overtime victory.
The shot from the corner for the last of her 27 points on the night, reminded some of another sharpshooter who wears No. 24.
""I didn't want to give them a chance to get the ball,"" Ogunbowale said after the game. ""I went into Mamba mentality. Kobe's here, so that's what I tried to channel.""
Beating UConn would usually get its fair share of national attention, but the Lady Mamba wasn't done.
Ogunbowale, who is on the cover of this week's Sports Illustrated, saved her best for last on the biggest stage.
Notre Dame trailed by 15 points in the third quarter of the national championship game to Mississippi State, but the Irish rallied to the game at 58, with only a few seconds left.
Ogunbowale then took an inbounds pass, headed toward the corner after dribbling twice and swished the off-balance triple with 0.1 second to give Notre Dame its second national championship.
For Ogunbowale and the Irish, the ending capped off a season that saw the team ravaged by injury, but still managed to win 35 games.
Ice, twice indeed.

              Relive the best moments of this year’s NCAA tournament with the classic “One Shining Moment” montage. 
            
            
The annual “One Shining Moment” montage is a must-watch after every NCAA tournament, but this year’s must be one of the most anticipated in recent memory. 
Villanova had the biggest shining moment, defeating Michigan in the national championship game on Monday night. But the tournament will most be remembered for a pair of underdogs—UMBC’s historic upset over Virginia in the first round and Loyola-Chicago’s run to the Final Four as a No. 11 seed. 
The Retrievers and Ramblers received plenty of love in this year’s “One Shining Moment,” along with the rest of this memorable tournament.

              Duke is a 5-1 favorite to win the 2019 National Championship
            
            
Duke is the odds–on favorite to take home the 2019 men's basketball national title, according to the the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas.
This season, the Blue Devils were eliminated in the Elite Eight by Kansas and were the favorites to take home the 2018 title as well. 
Duke opens as a 5-1 favorite for 2019 despite expecting to lose top talent to the NBA draft.
But Mike Krzyzewski has brought in the nation's top recruiting class in 2018, led by R.J. Barrett, Zion Williamson and Cam Reddish.
Villanova, who won their second title in the past three years by beating Michigan are installed as 8–1 favorites.
Kansas and Kentucky are also at 8–1, followed by North Carolina at 12-1, with Michigan State, Gonzaga and Virginia coming in at 15-1. The Wolverines are 20–1 favorites, while Oregon, West Virginia, UCLA and Auburn are each 30-1 favorites.
Loyola-Chicago, who made a surprise run to the Final Four, is 500-1 to bring home the trophy from Minneapolis.
UMBC, the first No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in the men's tournament when they upset Virginia, is not listed among the betting odds.

There are worse places to pass your 20s than baseball’s minor leagues. You work outdoors; you see America; you don’t have to wear a tie. But the pay is wretched and player autonomy near-nonexistent. And once most of your 20s have indeed passed, you must develop a self-image that contradicts your humble place in the sport: You have to convince yourself you belong in the majors, even though you know you aren’t there. The dissonance will wear anyone down. Last April, as a 29-year-old center-fielder for the Triple A Memphis Redbirds, Tommy Pham—with 136 big league games and 14 homers to his name and a baseball sporting the words believe in yourself tattooed on his left biceps—called a buddy back home in Las Vegas and said he was done. Baseball was all Pham had ever wanted to do, and he had played on despite a degenerative eye condition and three season-ending injuries in his prime. And he had no backup plan. While he had been an A student in high school, he hadn’t gone to college; his other work experience consisted of a summer as an electrician’s apprentice. No matter. He had had enough.
Pham had chafed at being stuck in Memphis before. Early in 2014, after being leapfrogged by better-regarded prospects such as Randal Grichuk, Stephen Piscotty and Oscar Taveras, Pham says he called Gary LaRocque, the Cardinals’ farm director, and demanded his release. “I said, ‘You know what, I’m the best mother------ on this team, and you guys don’t even know it,’” he recalls. “I said those exact words. They told me things happen, I’ll get some at bats. I just had to wear it.” (Indeed, true to his read, Pham, a 16th-round pick in 2006, had the best numbers on the team by season’s end.) 
While he made the Opening Day roster in 2016, he strained an oblique in his first at bat. Once Pham healed, the Cardinals sent him down to the Redbirds. In response, Pham says, he “threw numbers” at St. Louis manager Mike Matheny. “Looking back on it, that’s not something you want to do.” He took the relative high road when demoted again in spring training of 2017, telling Matheny, “I’m gonna go get better, but just know this: There’s not one player in the minor leagues with my Triple A résumé and my big league résumé, because they’re all up here starting.”
Still, Pham hadn’t thought to quit. Then the season started. “We’re two weeks in, and I’m raking,” he says. “I’m hitting like .400. The big league team was 3–9, and all three outfielders were hitting .200. They tried [Matt] Adams out there, and he’s a great hitter, but he just couldn’t play the outfield. So I’m like, They’re getting the reports every day, they know I’m raking. What the f---? When are they gonna call me up? And then we’re three weeks in. The guys are still struggling, Grichuk, Dex [Dexter Fowler], Piscotty. And I’m still balling! So finally I said, They’re not gonna f-----’ call me up, f--- it, and I zoned out in Triple A. Every day I was just like, F--- this. I’ve made it to the big leagues, f--- it.”
He stopped showing up for early work, daring his manager to bench him, daring St. Louis to cut him loose. Pham’s agents had learned that other MLB teams as well as Japanese clubs were interested. “I’m thinking, [the Cardinals] are not gonna trade me,” Pham says. “They won’t sell me to Japan. What the f---? They clearly don’t believe in me. Let a mother------ leave! And they wouldn’t even do that.” 
​
Pham’s best friend since Little League, Alvino Ramirez, told him to stick it out for a week or two. Edwin Jackson, the veteran pitcher who himself spent much of 2017 in Triple A and is one of Pham’s mentors, said the same thing. Tentatively, Pham checked back in. 
On May 4, Piscotty strained his hamstring, and Pham got called up. He homered in his first game, then hit two more in his third. He was on his way. His average never dropped below .277 or his OBP below .359. He hit better after the All-Star break than he did before it. At Pham’s urging, the Cardinals’ coaches put him through extra drills to improve his pitch selection, helping him cut down on his whiffs and increase his walks. Among qualified players in 2017, only Joey Votto and Matt Carpenter swung at fewer pitches outside the strike zone than Pham.
In 128 games he hit 23 homers, stole 25 bases and put up a .306/.411/.520 line while playing first-rate defense. Only 13 other players have been in the 20‑20, .300/.400/.500 club since 2000; Pham’s peers last year were Mike Trout and José Altuve. Despite missing 34 games, Pham ranked seventh in the NL in WAR (6.2) and finished 11th in the MVP voting, the top attraction on the worst Cardinals team (83–79) since ’07. 
After the season ended, Pham predicted only bigger things, aiming for a 30-30 season. And the Cardinals bought in, naming him their number 2 hitter and starting centerfielder, trading away Grichuk and Piscotty. Tommy Pham has made it. 
But one consequence of making it after being so close to quitting is that his hurt is still fresh. “I should have been doing this s--- sooner,” he says, sitting at a Chipotle in Miami in early February, before the start of camp. 
He smarts at how long it took Cardinals management to believe in him, apportioning some blame to his injuries (a torn wrist ligament in 2011, and labrums torn in each shoulder, in ’12 and ’13) and some to the December 2011 departure of scouting director Jeff Luhnow, a champion of Pham’s who left to become the Astros’ general manager. “The front office, I can’t entirely say they were on my side,” Pham says. “I wasn’t drafted by these people.” (He cites John Vuch, the team’s director of baseball administration, as his only remaining ally from the old regime.) 
When leftfielder Matt Holliday got hurt in 2015, Grichuk got that job, and when Peter Bourjos was benched, sliding Grichuk to center, Piscotty took over in left. Pham had to settle for 35 cobbled-together starts. “You can’t bitch about it, because if you bitch about it, you f--- up the team,” Pham says. “But I put up an .824 OPS and a 1.4 WAR in 150 at bats. Times that by four—if anybody did that their rookie year, baseball goes crazy over them. But when I did it, they say, Oh, he’s just the backup. In 2016, I had an .870 OPS before I stopped playing every day. An .870 OPS in the big leagues? That plays. But I never got the recognition. I put up better numbers than these other guys in the minor leagues and the major leagues. And I was a better athlete than these mother-------. I run faster than ’em, I’m stronger than ’em. But when a team puts some money in a player, they’re gonna talk ’em up.”
If Pham really is this good, he may have lost tens of millions in career earnings by spending his peak years in Memphis. He will be playing for nearly the minimum salary again in 2018 after turning down a two-year extension, and if his season is anything like the one before it, he will be providing the Cardinals a tremendous bargain. “They say one win is worth $8 million. Eight times six, that’s $48 million. I did all that for 500 grand.” Pham was heartened by the five-year, $80 million contract 31-year-old centerfielder Lorenzo Cain signed with Milwaukee in January. Pham plays a power-speed-defense game similar to Cain’s, but he won’t be eligible for free agency until after the 2021 season, at which point he will be 33 going on 34. “It sucks a little bit,” he says. “I’ll just have to get my money later.”
But the sting from his waylaying has less to do with finances than feeling disrespected. “They said, ‘We believed you could do it all along.’ That’s the thing that’s so mind-boggling. I said, If that’s the f-----’ case, then why was I f-----’ demoted to Triple A? If that’s the case, why the f--- was I batting in the eight hole this year, behind the guy who got f-----’ called up from high A? That s---, that’s that fake s---, man. I’m from a background where my mom kept it so real. My mom would be like, ‘Man, look, I don’t have no money to get you nothing for Christmas, I don’t have no money to get you nothing for your birthday. I’m sorry. I gotta pay the bills.’ I respected her because, s---, she told us from the get-go. All that fake s---, man, I was never raised like that.”
***
Las Vegas in recent years has become a reliable supplier of young stars such as Bryce Harper, Kris Bryant and Joey Gallo. The city and its Sun Belt sprawl make a fitting modern baseball cradle: It’s the sort of place where former minor leaguers can set up businesses and coach their sons, as Bryant’s and Gallo’s fathers did.
But that was not Tommy Pham’s Vegas. Thomas James Pham was born on March 8, 1988. His twin sister, Brittney, came two minutes later. Their mother, Tawana, was 17, and their father, Anhtuan, 19, was incarcerated, as he would be for most of his twins’ lives. (He will spend his 50th birthday in federal prison this June; his expected release is in October.)
Tommy has no relationship with his father. They’ve met three times, twice when Anhtuan was locked up and once outside of prison. “He used to write me letters. I told him years ago that I was done, and I wouldn’t visit him again,” Tommy says.
Anhtuan, who was born in Vietnam during the war to a black American father and a Vietnamese mother, had moved to the U.S. as a youngster with his mother, brother and sister. He was a gifted football player, but he became enmeshed in drugs and street crime: Corrections records show a rap sheet spanning three decades.
The pregnancy, Tawana says, crushed her parents at first: She had wound up a single mother of two, and she hadn’t even finished high school. But they offered to raise the twins with her as long as she worked. So she landed in food service, as a buser at first, working her way up to server. She got a second job in a bakery. 
Tawana needed the money and the help. Tommy wore leg braces from two to 3.5-years-old; the pediatrician worried he had rickets. She was working so much, she could hardly spend time at home. When the twins were five, she married Fred Polk, an electrician, and soon after they had a daughter, Mercedes. The blended family had many of the trappings of middle-class life, but Tawana was still holding down two jobs, which left Tommy and Brittney to look after themselves. Tawana set rules—no bad grades, no unstructured time—and Tommy went about enforcing them rather than stressing her out or risking her wrath. (Brittney still thinks of Tommy as her dad; he’ll weigh in on her dating life and tsk-tsk her about drinking when they go to nightclubs.) For the Pham kids, organized sports presented their only shot at fun. (Brittney’s sport was basketball.) During baseball season, Tommy’s coaches ferried him to practices and games. Once he started travel ball, at 10, with tournaments every weekend all over the country, coaches Todd Gamboa and Al Ramirez became surrogate fathers to Tommy. But for Tommy that wasn’t especially close to the real thing: Parents would console their kids when they made errors. The coaches didn’t do that, not even for their star shortstop.
And when he was trying to improve after practice, after his coaches had already dropped him back home, Pham had no one to play catch with. He practiced his defense by throwing a baseball against the brick wall behind his house and fielding the rebound; he worked on his hitting by tossing a Wiffle ball high into the air, then waiting for it to come down.
One year Pham’s team celebrated its season by renting out a sports park, and while his teammates raced go-karts and went on rides, he spent the entire evening in the batting cage. Says Pham’s friend (and his coach’s son), Alvino Ramirez, “He was a hard-nosed kid back then, and he’s a hard-nosed adult right now. His demeanor hasn’t changed.” Where his twin sister is bubbly and social—she’s a bartender—Tommy can be steely and distant. He berates himself for mistakes and broods after bad games. Since tasting success he’s only gotten harder on himself.
Tawana used to be ashamed of the twins’ severe childhoods, she says. After talking it over with Tommy a few years ago, though, she made peace with it. When he was young, she would tell him how easily he could become a statistic—a mixed-race boy born to an incarcerated father and a single, teenage mother. “Some parents care too little; I cared too much,” Tawana says. “I saved Tommy.” 
In May 2016, Brittney got a call from a number she didn’t recognize. It was a police sergeant informing her that her father was in intensive care. He had been shot nine times by an off-duty cop while allegedly trying to shoplift two bags of crab legs from a Washington, D.C., grocery store. He had supposedly pulled a replica handgun on the officer. Brittney went with her six-year-old son, Clayton, to see him in the hospital; her mother and grandmother, whom she had asked to join her, declined to go, saying they’d had enough.
Seeing him shackled to the hospital bed, she pitied him. It hit Brittney that she was indeed all he had: “He has messed up, and he keeps messing up. But I think I have to forgive him and treat him with respect because he still did bring me into this world.” In recent letters from prison, her father has struck a new contrite tone and expressed his continued desire to have a relationship with Tommy. She has told him not to expect that. “I do think Tommy would feel better if he forgave him,” she says. “He’s got a lot of anger.”
Tommy says, “I don’t talk to him, no. That’s only because he’s a person I don’t know. But am I mad? No. Because it only made me better. And it’s funny, you know, a lot of the lessons I learned in life, as far as being a grown man, I learned in baseball.” Curtis Granderson, the All-Star outfielder, took Pham to buy his first suit a few spring trainings ago.
“I don’t feel sorry for myself, I really don’t,” Pham says. “I made the most out of my situation—but these things weren’t hardships to me. It was just life.”
***
Pham spent this past offseason, like the one before it, training in Miami. He’d like to be back in Vegas, but the city lacks a sports performance facility that meets his specialized requirements. So he rented an apartment in a downtown high-rise with floor-to-ceiling windows that offer a view of the city and Miami Beach. He keeps the place clean; his whole family is fastidious. On his coffee table sits a book of Spanish grammar. Pham has a brilliant smile, one he uses sparingly, saving it for moments like this. “I ain’t gonna lie to you and be like, ‘I wanna be able to communicate with my Latin teammates.’ I’m learning ’cause I like Spanish women,” he says. Whatever the context, he always puts in extra effort to improve.
Over the years Pham has retained no fewer than five hitting coaches. (“They all cost money. Some of ’em way too f-----’ much.”) He spent thousands in 2016 on special contact lenses to improve his degenerative eye condition, keratoconus. They didn’t help, so he ditched them. When the Redbirds’ pitching machine broke, he ordered a new one, the $3,300 Hack Attack, which simulates a pitcher’s actual elevated release point. He reads everything he can on mechanics, nutrition and sabermetrics.
“A lot of guys in this game are complacent,” he says. “They’ll say, I wanna run faster, lemme go run some sprints. I say, I wanna run faster. I’ll look at my mechanics and see I have a bad knee drive. What causes a bad knee drive? I lack ankle mobility. O.K., so if I fix my ankle mobility, I can achieve a dorsiflex position which could drive my knee up. O.K., I need to improve my stride frequency. Let me go run 30-degree incline sprints at 18 miles per hour so I can improve my stride frequency. And let me do some overspeed training so I can train my neuromuscular system to run faster than I’m biologically capable of. You know what I mean. Guys don’t do that s---. They don’t break it down like that.”
Pham wasn’t always so open to learning; he says no coach could break through his hardheadedness until Jeff Albert, now the Astros’ assistant hitting coach, got to him in his fourth year of pro ball. It was late July and Pham’s average was hovering around .200. His high-A team’s game in Lakeland, Fla., was rained out. Pham says, “I was struggling so bad, I said, f--- it, I’m tired of struggling. What do I need to do?” Albert showed him video of his swing compared with proper form. From there, Pham says, he was all but set.
Last season Pham followed the same routine every game day. He would hit off a tee, then have a coach flip him balls and strikes. Then came batting practice. When the first group hit, he’d shag flies in the outfield. When the second group came up, he’d work on his batted-ball reads and baserunning. He’d hit in the third group. Then he’d come in, eat, hit off the tee again, hit off the pitching machine, shower and play the game. He says after all that preparation, playing becomes the easiest part of his day. Once the game’s over and he’s home, he might call his sisters back in Vegas to see what his niece and nephew are up to. He’ll put on the TV—some nights MLB Network, some nights HGTV—and stand, bat in hand, by the set and a nearby mirror, practicing his swing mechanics until he’s ready to sleep.
He figures his drive gives him his biggest edge. I asked him where it came from; he cited his lean upbringing. He owes everything to it, he says. I pressed, surprised that a man so affronted by his delayed promotion in pro baseball carried so little bitterness about more foundational deprivations—no father, little money. 
A few days after our interview, Pham sent a text message: “The question was if I wish I had it easier or came up rich, would I have wanted that? The more I thought about it my answer is no. I played with a lot of guys coming up who came from a wealthy upbringing and what I remembered most about them is how soft they were. When things got harder for them, they always crumbled. I think where I came from helped me persevere through all my injuries in everything bcuz I seen a lot of guys fold, the most successful ppl in the world came from the smallest beginnings which makes me think it’s not about where you’re from or how you come up but where are you going!”
So just where is Tommy Pham going? Few players have more at stake in 2018. A repeat of his 2017 performance would put him among the best handful of players in the game; a letdown would suggest that last year had been little more than luck. He has staked his baseball credibility—which may very well be his signature asset—on another monster season. And while free agency is years away, he should become arbitration-eligible this winter, meaning his pay will be directly tied to his play. No pressure.
He is reminded of something he read a few days ago, a story about a former No. 1 draft pick, born to privilege, who had retired without making the majors. “He said something along the lines of, ‘Yeah, baseball’s not my identity,’ ” Pham says. “A guy who was the No. 1 pick? I dunno if he was all in. For me, baseball’s all I ever wanted to do. I’m all in.”

723,"
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Louisville entered the 2015 season with plenty of quarterbacks, but the Cardinals were struggling to find a punt returner.
True freshman QB Lamar Jackson’s athleticism was so tantalizing, and the need for a dynamic returner so urgent, that someone on the coaching staff asked him to go field a punt and see what happens.
Seemingly minutes after practice had ended, members of the coaching staff got a call from Jackson’s mother, Felicia Jones. Head coach Bobby Petrino had lured Jackson to the Bluegrass State with the assurance that the freshman would be a quarterback and only a quarterback. Punt returner doesn’t look like quarterback, Jones said. She reminded them all of the promise Petrino had made to her and her son while sitting on a couch in their South Florida home. Jackson never went back for a punt return in practice again.
Jackson is arguably the most unique and perplexing prospect in this year’s draft. Few quarterbacks in any class can match his athletic ability, yet he’s solidly fifth in this crop, according to most projections. There have been calls to move him to wide receiver, echoing the ugliness of how talented black quarterbacks have been treated by football’s white decision-makers throughout the sport’s history. And there’s the business side of it for Jackson, entering a multibillion-dollar league without the guidance of an experienced agent, something that almost never happens for a potential first-round quarterback.
His mother is his manager, though no one really knows what that means. Is she a helicopter parent, or is she simply steering a ship that’s being carried by the current? Did she tell him not to run the 40 or do agility drills, and if so, why? Why is she easier to reach for some teams than for others?
To a man, in interviews with people who have known Jackson and his mother since he was a teenager, everyone says Felicia Jones has her son’s best interests at heart. Clearly those interests are to ensure that he’s a starting NFL quarterback, a path they’ve traveled together for years.
Like Jackson’s pre-draft process, so much of his narrative is in the shadows. His mother is fiercely private; it seems the only interview she has ever granted was to ESPN the night Jackson won the Heisman in 2016. It has rubbed off on her son—nearly every media request his camp has received since he declared for the draft has been declined.
Jackson has said his father died in a car accident when he was 8, and on that same day his grandmother died, too. Jones told him then not to cry, that they would do better and amount to something. And that’s the extent of Jackson’s public comments about a defining moment in his life.
He began his high school career at Santaluces High in Lantana, Fla., about 60 miles north of Miami on Florida’s east coast, but left at some point after his freshman year. One person interviewed for this story thought it was because he wasn’t guaranteed the starting quarterback role and was splitting time. Jackson transferred to nearby Boynton Beach.
When you play high school football in South Florida, it’s almost a rite of passage to transfer schools at least once. Whatever the reason, “it was a gift from the football gods” for Rick Swain. The head coach at Boynton Beach had been running the Wing-T shotgun for the better part of two decades when Jackson transferred in. Jackson had done some passing drills before spring ball and looked good, but Swain had a converted wide receiver whom he had been grooming to take over at quarterback. He put in an option play for Jackson on the first day of spring practice, and Jackson read the end, stuck his foot in the ground, turned north and went 60 yards untouched.
“Man, we’re changing offenses,” Swain remembers telling his assistant coach. “I’ve run this offense off and on for 20 years, but that ain’t what we need to be running with this kid.”
And thus, for the first time, a coach tailored his offense for Lamar Jackson. Swain had never been a subscriber to the philosophy that you put your best athlete at quarterback. Jackson changed that. Boynton Beach went to the pistol with four wideouts as its base; occasionally a tight end would be used. The idea was simple: spread out the defense and let Jackson shred it.
Once, Swain caught a wild hair and wanted to use his best athlete as a safety in obvious passing downs and Hail Mary situations, hardly an unusual strategy. But just as with the punt return a few years later, it never happened.
“Coach,” Swain remembers Jones telling him, “he’s a quarterback. And I don’t want anybody to think he’s anything else.”
But many did think he was something else, even if they couldn’t put a finger on it. A three-star recruit, Jackson was sought-after as an athlete by dozens of top colleges, but he was only going where he could play quarterback, and with a realistic chance to start early. Some engineering had to be done.
In 2013, Lamar Thomas, the former University of Miami wideout who spent eight seasons in the NFL, was coaching receivers at Western Kentucky under Bobby Petrino. It was Swain, Thomas’s high school coach, who put him on to Jackson. Petrino took the Louisville job in January 2014, and Thomas followed him, continuing to recruit Jackson. He had a tough time selling his boss on the quarterback’s tape, though, so he came up with a different approach.
“His highlight film at first was runs and then throws,” Thomas says. “I told [Swain], Hey, put that throwing on his highlight film first. Don’t put that running crap up first.”
Swain changed the film and posted a new highlight tape to Hudl. Thomas sat down with Petrino in the offensive meeting room.
Have you told me about this kid before?
“Yes, coach.”
Can we get this kid?
“Coach, I got him!”
Thomas had to sell momma first, though. Louisville had to promise that Jackson would be a quarterback-only. The first time Thomas met Felicia Jones, he did all the talking, and she stared at him without saying a word. He says they laugh about that now.
Thomas’s word wasn’t enough, however. Jones needed to hear it from Petrino. So the coach walked into her home and promised that her son would play quarterback-only and have a chance for significant playing time as a true freshman. Jackson was on his way to joining the Cardinals.
“Just from being around the situation, to get Coach Petrino to say something like that, that was big. That was huge,” Thomas says. “It was also him being a man of his word. It forced him to be a man of his word, and it was a good thing.”
• BAKER MAYFIELD: THE SCOUTING REPORT: Robert Klemko’s series on the draft’s most interesting prospect
Jackson’s first fall camp at Louisville played out just like his first spring practice at Boynton Beach. He was competing with Reggie Bonnafon and Kyle Bolin, both of whom had started games the previous season. The Cardinals put a read-option play in for Jackson, who read the end perfectly, stuck his foot in the ground and went north for a 75-yard touchdown.
“You could see his natural ability in camp. That’s why we knew we were going to have to play him,” says quarterbacks coach Nick Petrino. “There wasn’t going to be any redshirt situation. We knew we were going to have to develop him throughout the year, and he’d end up playing. But [being too raw] coming out of high school is why he didn’t start right away.”
Bonnafon won the right to start against Auburn in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, but Jackson got the first pass attempt of the season when Petrino dialed up a trick play on the first play from scrimmage. Jackson rolled right, away from pressure, and threw a prayer near the sideline into double coverage. Interception.
As Petrino wove a tapestry of obscenities over the headset to his offensive coaches, Thomas went over to Jackson on the bench, put his hands on the young quarterback’s shoulders and told him to forget about it.
“I’m good, coach,” Jackson said to Thomas. “When am I going to be able to get back in?”
Louisville, a double-digit underdog to the sixth-ranked Tigers, was down 14-0 midway through the second quarter when Petrino put Jackson back in the game, this time at quarterback. He led three second-half touchdown drives—rushing for 106 yards and throwing for 100—and Louisville nearly finished the comeback in a 31-24 loss.
The Cardinals played musical chairs at the position until the regular-season finale at Kentucky. After a Bolin pick-six put UK up 21-0 midway through the first quarter, Petrino pulled his starter. Again, Thomas went over to his prized recruit on the bench.
“L.J., are you ready?”
“Coach, I was born ready.”
Jackson would account for 316 yards of total offense and three touchdowns in a 38-24 win. He never relinquished the job.
During that freshman year Jackson roomed with receiver Jaylen Smith, who went on to become his favorite target last season. After games, Jackson would put his mom on speakerphone, and she would offer critiques of the roommates’ performances.
“She doesn’t [hold back],” Smith says. “And kids like us needed that. I didn’t take it like, ‘Who is she to tell me what I’m supposed to be doing.’ Nah, she’s really watching and knows what’s going on.”
Jackson and his mother, Felicia Jones, at the 2016 Heisman ceremony.
Jackson’s sophomore year is now legend. He passed for 3,543 yards, with 30 touchdowns and nine interceptions, and rushed for 1,571 yards and 21 TDs, winning the Heisman with nearly twice as many first-place votes as runner-up Deshaun Watson.
Petrino wanted to expand his offense going into Jackson’s junior season, and the quarterback had reached a point in his development where he was able to rely less on his legs. The Cardinals spent the first week of spring ball working him solely under center. The dropback passing game received greater emphasis, and Jackson began the process of widening his narrow throwing base. As the coaches molded him into a better passing quarterback, he got more freedom at the line of scrimmage to make checks.
“Like the head coach says,” the younger Petrino starts, “he has the freedom to make the checks we tell him to on every play.”
But Jackson didn’t get the publicity typically afforded to a reigning Heisman winner. Throughout the fall, as his numbers began to eclipse those of his sophomore season, Jackson often remained an afterthought in the national conversation. He has been mostly quiet since he left Louisville, doing a group interview at the NFL scouting combine last month and a couple hits with ESPN. In that combine interview he said his mother was his manager but not his agent, that he will not hire an agent, and that he will use a lawyer to look over his rookie contract. Jones has kept her silence, just as she did throughout Jackson’s collegiate career. She declined multiple interview requests from The MMQB over the past two months. For these two, mum’s the word.
“It’s not that she’s trying to—in my opinion—control him,” Thomas says. “They’ve been through a lot together. For them to want to stay together and try to do this thing together, that’s the way they’ve always been. They’d just rather the play do the talking.
“You’ve seen parents before in these ordeals where they try to be the spokesperson, whether it’s [LaVar] Ball or [Todd] Marinovich’s dad a long time ago. That’s not her deal. Can you blame her? If she was one of those people who was trying to put herself in front of all this, you’d say, ‘Oh here we go.’ But it’s not like that.
“It’s different than sometimes it’s portrayed. I know it’s hard for you guys in the media because she’s not accessible or talkative, but would you rather have it the Ball way or this way?”
• SAM DARNOLD’S PODCAST LIFE: What the quarterback was doing off-the-field at USC.
At Louisville’s pro day last week, multiple teams expressed to The MMQB that it’s been difficult to get in touch with Jackson and that calls have not been returned. This information is coming straight from teams and not, as some theorize, from agents wishing to crush Jackson’s choice to not hire one.
The entire pre-draft process has been unique for Jackson. A potential first-round pick, he’s met with the Texans (who have Deshaun Watson and don’t choose until the third round) and the Chargers and, according to ESPN, has a private workout with the hometown Dolphins. At this point, it’s unclear which other teams, if any, Jackson has met with since the combine.
After his pro day workout, Jackson spoke to former Heisman winner Andre Ware of ESPN, before going to NFL Network’s Mike Mayock for a four-minute sit down. Both of those interviews were approved by Jones, who did not O.K. Jackson taking questions from other media in attendance, as is the custom at pro days.
It’s also unclear if Jackson has an apparel endorser. Again, most players of his caliber would be suited and booted by Nike, Adidas or Under Armour by now, their social media pages awash with corporate thank-yous for the easy check. At his pro day, Jackson wore a school-issued Adidas top and shorts, then slipped off his Gucci sandals before his workout to don orange-and-silver Nike cleats.
And finally, Jackson’s decision to not run the 40 at either the combine or his pro day drew the most scrutiny (curiously, more than the reports of NFL teams being unable to reach him). It’s obvious Jackson is the fastest quarterback in this draft and likely the fastest since Michael Vick. What will a 40 time tell NFL teams other than reaffirming the beliefs of those who think he’s more athlete than quarterback? From Jackson’s perspective, how does that help him get drafted as a QB?
Joshua Harris has been coaching Jackson since the quarterback left Louisville. Harris is a high school coach in South Florida who reportedly played college football at Miami before transferring to Tennessee State. He scripted a pro day workout that saw Jackson get under center for all 59 of his throws, and Jackson worked with his receivers in Louisville for the three days before last Thursday’s big day. Felicia Jones was there for the practices.
“She brought me and him together two days ago when we were running routes in here,” says Bonnafon, the Louisville quarterback-turned-receiver/running back who performed well at the pro day. “She was telling me to come out of my breaks and not wait on him to throw the ball. She’s like, ‘Don’t wait on Lamar to place the ball. If you’re already out of your break and he’s late, that’s his fault.’ It’s kind of different. But she’s a great lady.”
Jackson looked great throwing the ball, better than the numbers (47-for-59) would suggest. Of his 12 misses, eight were drops and one was a wide receiver slip. He was inaccurate on just three throws. Harris directed Jackson, and the coach was flanked by two friends of Jackson’s family, though no one in Jackson’s camp or from Louisville would or could divulge their names.
The three men wore black outfits with a “Super 8” logo printed on them. Inside the red 8 were the words: God, prayer, faith, family, education, sacrifice, character, discipline. These are the eight core values Jones has espoused for years. She sat in a black swivel chair past midfield as Jackson worked his way through the script from the opposite 40 into the red zone. When the workout was complete, several of Jackson’s receivers came over to hug her.
“Did I do good?,” tight end Charles Standberry asked her. She told him yes. “I ain’t trying to get your son…” he said before trailing off, out of breath.
The Super 8 team gathered their belongings and headed to the exit of the indoor practice facility. Waiting outside was Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and quarterbacks coach Shane Steichen. In Philip Rivers, the Chargers have an aging franchise quarterback, and coach Anthony Lynn gushed about Jackson’s playmaking ability at the combine. The team wanted to meet with Jackson.
And so Louisville reserved a room at the team facilities, and Whisenhunt and Harris communicated about where exactly the room was located. Then Jackson, his coach, his family friends and his mother walked off together as the quarterback headed to his latest job interview.

SAN ANTONIO — Confetti fell for one team and tears fell for another, and for a few moments, Jordan Poole couldn’t compose himself. As he sat in the Michigan locker room, Poole did not look like a future All-Big Ten player or the guy who made one of the biggest shots in this NCAA tournament. He was just a 19-year-old in braces, trying to laugh through the tears.
Not far away, freshman Isaiah Livers was almost as choked up. As a kid, Livers saw losing players cry and asked his parents: “Why are they so hurt?” And now, Monday night, he got it. He saw seniors Duncan Robinson and Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman walk off the court, losers in their last college game, to Villanova for the national title, and he couldn’t take it.
Poole and Livers, gifted freshmen, embody both the hope and sadness in the room. Their talent is one reason why Michigan will have better teams than this under John Beilein. But that doesn’t mean the Wolverines will get here again.
So let’s take a moment, first, and appreciate how close Michigan came to winning the school’s second national title.
And yes: The Wolverines were close. It didn’t seem that way Monday night. Well, when you shoot 3 for 23 from the three-point line against the best team in the country, you will lose. The math there is pretty simple, and it goes a long way toward explaining Villanova’s 79–62 victory.
It’s not that the Wolverines thought they were the better team. They seemed to know they were not. But they squandered their chance to win by missing open shots, and then by letting those misses affect them in other ways, especially on the glass. For fans around the nation who didn’t watch Michigan all year, understand: The Wolverines played heavyweights Michigan State and Purdue five times this year, and won the rebounding battle all five times. Then they played Villanova, a perimeter-oriented team, and gave up 12 offensive rebounds.
This is life in the NCAA tournament. You have to be the best team on six nights. Michigan was the best on five. The Wolverines needed to play really well and hope Villanova had a slightly off night. Neither of those things happened, and so here they were.
Beilein stood in a hallway afterward and talked about how “connected” his players were. He is one of the best coaches in college basketball, and the straightest of arrows in a sport that doesn’t have enough straight arrows.
In the last two years, Beilein has shown how adaptable he is—this year’s team was better on defense than offense—and he has done a fabulous job hiring assistant coaches. There has never been a more comfortable, more enjoyable time to be a Michigan basketball fan.
The Wolverines now enter that Wait And See phase of the college basketball season, when we find out who is staying and who is going. NBA early entries and the transfer market make it tricky to predict next season. Michigan should be very good in 2018–19. The Wolverines’ chance at great may hinge on what happens in the next month.
Junior Moritz Wagner declined to answer questions about his NBA future, which was smart. We had to ask. He didn’t have to answer. His decision will be one of the most interesting in the sport. He almost left Michigan last year, but took his feedback from the NBA and returned to school. What does he do now?
Wagner is extremely skilled for a 6'11"" collegian. But he is not really an NBA athlete. He became a competent Big Ten defender, but he would struggle against the best athletes in the world. Wagner has excellent shooting range but his shots in the paint would get blocked a lot in the NBA. He is probably a second-round pick, and I think he is more likely to go undrafted than in the first round. If he wants to go pro anyway, he should. It’s his life. But it would seem to be a difficult decision.
Junior Charles Matthews is an NBA athlete, but his shot is so shaky that it’s hard to see him getting drafted right now. Matthews was the team’s best player over the first five games of this tournament, and maybe its worst in the championship game. He played poorly on both ends. It would not be surprising if Matthews tests the NBA waters, if only to get feedback. But ultimately, staying in school seems like the wise and likely choice.
If everybody who is eligible comes back, this is a top 10 team, maybe top five. If Wagner leaves … well, this year’s team started unranked and ended up playing on the first Monday in April. Next year’s team will still be very good.
Poole is the probably the best player on the team at creating his own shot. Livers is just starting to realize how good he can be. Point guard Zavier Simpson was a dominant defender this year, and the best player at Michigan’s first practice in San Antonio was freshman point guard Eli Brooks, who is more of a pure playmaker. A top-10 recruiting class is on its way. Beilein will have plenty of very good options.
When Michigan lost the 2013 title game to Louisville, players were upset. This felt different. The 2013 team featured several future NBA players. This year’s Wolverines seemed to know this might be their biggest and best shot at basketball euphoria.
Abdur-Rahkman​ and Robinson (and maybe Wagner) can leave knowing they did more than just make the national title game. They showed talented young players how to lead a team here. Livers promised to be a different kind of person in practice—no longer the happy freshmen, but a leader.
“I want to do what Duncan and Muhammad did, even as a sophomore,” Livers said.
Michigan now has a program, top to bottom, that will keep giving itself chances. This year’s run may have been a surprise. A similar run in the next two years should surprise nobody.
Before the game—before those Michigan shots went awry and Villanova played at such a high level that it got ugly—I said hello to former Michigan athletic director Bill Martin. I asked Martin: “Has anybody given you credit this week?” He laughed. Eleven years ago today, Martin hired Beilein away from West Virginia. As everybody in the losing locker room here would tell you, it was one of the best moves in the school’s athletic history.

              Zlatan Ibrahimovic is slated to make his MLS debut, but he has barely played in the last year as he bounces back from a major knee injury. The level of his on-field impact in MLS depends on its status.
            
            
Zlatan Ibrahimovic could make his MLS debut on Saturday, when the LA Galaxy face expansion LAFC on Saturday at StubHub Center. His arrival has caught plenty of attention, both in the USA and abroad, and all eyes will be on the Swedish legend to see if he can fulfill the lofty expectations that come with his signing.
Even though he's signed at a relative discount ($3 million total for two years, fueled by Targeted Allocation Money), with LAFC hitting on all cylinders to start life in MLS and other teams hitting big on winter signings, the pressure is on for Ibrahimovic to perform at a high level–and soon. But with him being inactive for months after suffering an injury setback with Manchester United following his recovery from a torn ACL, there's plenty of curiosity regarding how impactful he can be from the start.
We discuss Ibrahimovic's arrival in this week's Planet Fútbol Podcast. You can listen to the full discussion on this week's podcast in the console below, with the section about Zlatan beginning at the 17:42 mark. You can subscribe to and download the podcast at iTunes here.
GRANT WAHL: Zlatan Ibrahimović, since our last podcast together, has signed with the LA Galaxy and will be joining the team soon here—perhaps even time for the LA-LAFC game, which is this Saturday on big Fox at 3 pm Eastern. Ibrahimović is coming on a TAM deal, not a Designated Player deal. His knee may or may not be in good shape. We don’t know. How are you feeling about it?
BRIAN STRAUS: It depends on his knee. I know what happens in your mid 30s—what happens to your body. You don’t recover like you did. Stuff hurts in ways it didn’t before. You just don’t have the same explosiveness and elasticity. It can go quickly. He’s got a wonderful personality. He’s fun. He’s quotable. He’s got that whole lion cliche thing going on. Everyone loves that.
So, I credit the Galaxy. I don’t know what kind of marketing deals have been arranged, or what kind of compensation is happening outside the MLS structure. But, good for them for not blowing the bank on a guy who’s in his mid-to-late 30s and is coming off a serious injury. So, we’ll see.
GW: I guess here’s my question. The promotional aspect was pretty over the top, as you might expect—buying a full page ad in the L.A. Times to announce Ibrahimović’s arrival. There’s a billboard with Ibrahimović out in L.A. right now, in fact multiple billboards. I guess my question is, is it possible that they would not have done this much promotion if the Galaxy and Ibrahimović were really concerned about his knee?

BS: That’s a good question. I don’t know. Maybe there was some pressure there to make a splash, you know, with LAFC coming in and the start that they’ve had. They’ve become a really intriguing team that’s playing good soccer, and maybe the Galaxy felt some pressure to take back some of the headlines and some of the conversation. It’s a good question.
The benefit of the doubt in the Galaxy has eroded a little bit. Steven Gerrard didn’t work out. The jury is very much out on Gio dos Santos. … Not everything they’ve touched has turned to gold at this point. So, maybe you’d think they’d be a little cautious considering that. But at the same time, they’ve got this noisy neighbor now to deal with.
It’ll be fun. I’m looking forward to seeing what the atmosphere is on Saturday, regardless. It’s the first of what hopefully becomes a big rivalry between these two clubs, and that can only really happen authentically over time. But it’ll be a fun thing to see, and to see how the guys react to each other and respond, and what the atmosphere is like. It’ll be cool.
GW: We had Bob Bradley on the podcast earlier this week and we talked a little bit about the LA-LAFC game. If you haven’t listen to this … Bob is incapable of giving a bland interview at this point. … I think for Bradley, it would be huge to get yet another win against the Galaxy on the road, in a sold out stadium, on national television.

Rumors, factoids, league-meetings leftovers and draft niblets 24 days before the start of the NFL draft:
I know the first question I’d ask Josh Rosen in Cleveland this week. The UCLA quarterback travels to Cleveland to meet with Browns brass this week. (He has seven team trips scheduled by mid-April—Browns, Jets, Giants, Cards, Broncos, Bills, Chargers). Cleveland owns the first and fourth picks in the first round and will use one of the picks on a quarterback. You know that Cleveland GM John Dorsey at some point is going to ask Rosen: What’s up with you and your coach at UCLA? Last week, Jim Mora, fired as Bruins coach last fall, said on NFL Network that he’d take USC quarterback Sam Darnold over Rosen with the first pick in the draft if he were running the Browns. Mora said it was “because of fit” and cited Darnold’s “blue-collar, gritty attitude.” My jaw dropped when I heard that. And I can tell you the jaws of more than a few NFL people at the meetings in Orlando last week dropped too. Mora did go on to say that if he were the Giants or Jets at two and three in the draft order, he’d have the card with Rosen’s name on it, ready to turn in. But that didn’t get much attention.
Mora coached Rosen for three years. Rosen and Darnold are competing to be the top player picked in this draft. Oh, and Darnold played for UCLA’s archrival. Was Mora trying to slap the free-spirited Rosen with some tough love? Was Mora taking this TV analyst neutral-party thing very seriously and simply telling the truth as he sees it? Or was Mora trying to help his old quarterback avoid Cleveland and land with the Giants and a quarterback mentor he trusts, Pat Shurmur, at number two?
I spoke with Mora on Sunday, and he understands the tornado his words created. But he stood by his point that Darnold and his don’t-worry, be-happy ethos (my words, not his) would be a better long-haul fit for a Cleveland team that likely will take a while to win. “I put it in the context of ‘fit,’” Mora told me. He strongly emphasized the word “fit” in our conversation. He said Darnold has “the underdog mentality that I think will fit so well in Cleveland, a franchise that’s really been down.”
Of his own quarterback, Mora said: “Josh, I think, without a doubt, is the number one quarterback in the draft. He’s a franchise-changer. He’s got the ability to have an immediate impact. His arm talent, intelligence, and his ability to see the game and diagnose the game is rare. He’d come to the sidelines after a play and it was uncanny—he could right away say exactly why he made every decision.
“He needs to be challenged intellectually so he doesn’t get bored. He’s a millennial. He wants to know why. Millennials, once they know why, they’re good. Josh has a lot of interests in life. If you can hold his concentration level and focus only on football for a few years, he will set the world on fire. He has so much ability, and he’s a really good kid.” It sounded like Mora thinks Rosen would be well-served to be pushed by quarterback mentors like Shurmur (Giants) or Jeremy Bates (Jets), and to learn for a year or so from Eli Manning (Giants) or Josh McCown (Jets).
Much of what Mora just said in the last two paragraphs is what he’d tell an NFL GM if he called to ask about Rosen. Curiously, Mora said: “None of them have called, which is interesting.”
There’s time, of course, and Mora figures the calls will come. I’d be surprised if they didn’t, after the hubbub around his NFL Network comments. Rosen, by the way, got an explanatory text from Mora before Mora said his piece on air, but I’m told Rosen still was stunned by what his coach and neighbor said on TV. (Rosen lived in the same L.A. neighborhood as Mora, and he is friendly with Mora’s daughter.)
I have never heard of anything like this, even with the Giants/Jets note following what Mora said first. When Mark Sanchez declared for the draft after the 2008 season at USC, coach Pete Carroll was critical of the decision, saying he thought Sanchez should stay in school. That’s a little different, though, than saying the quarterback of your archrival should be picked above your own guy. That’s not going to help Rosen’s cause at the top of the draft. It will also be noted by teams that Mora says you need to “hold Rosen’s concentration level.” It’ll be fascinating to see which team takes the plunge with Rosen, and how they process the information they’re hearing out of UCLA.
“One thing I do want teams to know,” Mora said. “It’s desperately important for Josh to be a great player.”
Noted.
FOD (Friend of Dorsey) thinks Browns will go Allen-Saquon at 1 and 4. What would an April MMQB be without another draft rumor?! This friend of Cleveland GM John Dorsey believes he’ll go Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen over Sam Darnold with the first overall pick, keep the fourth pick, and take Penn State running back Saquon Barkley. “I would be surprised if he traded down,” FOD told me. “This would be his chance to take his two offensive cornerstones for the next eight or 10 years.” The most interesting thing there? That FOD thinks Dorsey will not trade. I think that’s great. Cleveland’s been very good at trading and stockpiling, and not very good at drafting, in the last few years. I hope Dorsey’s more about the (relatively) sure things instead of Cleveland leading the league in draft picks.
The next step in the controversial lowering-the-helmet ban rule is a month away. It’s now going to be a penalty for an NFL player to lower his head to initiate helmet-to-opponent contact, and the devil will be in the details on this one. The NFL has seven weeks to write the rule the right way; the league wants it done by the NFL spring meetings beginning 49 days from today, May 21-23 in Atlanta. About three weeks before then, the NFL will invite some eight or 10 people to New York for a summit meeting—four to six coaches, a couple owners or top club officials, and a two or three players—to get the language of the rule right. The other interesting parts of this new rule:
• Replay. Still to be determined, but it’s highly likely replays of the helmet violations will be handled by VP of officiating Al Riveron in the officiating command center in New York. The league does not want to add the element of delay into the system that would come if the referee in the stadium had to review the play on his tablet. The likely scenario is if there’s an infraction or ejection, Riveron and his New York crew will review (quickly, the hope is) and inform the referee on site whether the call is upheld or reversed without any sort of coaching challenge.
• Frequency. The league is hesitant to project how many helmet-lowering fouls per game will be called; after instructing teams in the exact rule this offseason, it’ll be up to the coaches to teach it right and the players to live by the rule. But last year there were 2.65 offensive holding infractions walked off per game, and 1.08 defensive pass interference penalties accepted. The best guess, one league official said, is probably between those numbers, between one and two fouls per game. Ejections? I’ll be surprised if there’s more than a dozen in 2018. “I think we won’t be ejection-happy,” said Competition Committee chairman Rich McKay. “We’d eject only with the obvious infractions. We will make it clear what the standard for ejection will be when we meet with the teams. We [the Competition Committee members] were actually caught off guard that coaches wanted ejection to be an immediate part of the rule.”
• The big change. One of the major boosters for the new rule was John Madden, who is the league’s co-chair of the Player Safety Advisory Panel and the head of the Coaches Subcommittee of the Competition Committee. “Coach Madden said he thinks this could be the final step to get the helmet out of the run game,” McKay said. Currently, helmet-to-helmet contact is allowed on running plays, the theory being it’s just too hard in close quarters of running plays to police when players bash helmets. The other area of adjustment will be in open-field collisions. When the NFL studied its 291 documented concussions in 2017, many players were seen lowering their heads to deliver a blow in the open field. That was a factor in making this a rule for 2018.
• Coaching it. “I don’t feel like this is going to be a revolutionary change to the game,” said Saints coach Sean Payton, a member of the Competition Committee. “I’ve got a big note here [to relay to his coaches]—our job is to teach the fundamentals. I learned a lot about teaching during my one-year suspension, coaching my son Conner’s team when he was in sixth grade: eyes up, heads up, wrap up. When we coach taking on blocks, it’s eyes up, heads away. It’ll become our dialog throughout the team.”
• Officiating it. This is the bugaboo. Calling this consistently is going to be very hard. As former officiating VP Mike Pereira said on SiriusXM NFL Radio: “I think it will be impossible to officiate.” That’ll be the biggest thing to watch. Along with the new catch rule, the officials are going to struggle making the helmet call, and they may struggle for years.
I find it ironic that in the wake of the passage of this rule, the majority of players who have spoken out hate it. They think it will change football as we know it. It’s ironic because part of the reason for the rule—maybe the biggest part—is to minimize the kind of blows that could lead to brain issues for players later in life, and here are so many players against what should be good for them. Ironic, too, that Payton is one of the biggest supporters of the rule. Payton spent lots of time before and during his Bountygate suspension at absolute loggerheads with the league on sanctions. Not now. Even though the final version of the rule is still cloudy, Payton thinks this is a vital change for the next generation of players.
“We owe this to the game,” Payton said. “Ten years from now, people will look at this moment and say, ‘That was a big deal.’”
There’s too much smoke around the Odell Beckham Jr.-to-the-Rams trade story to dismiss it. First it was Giants CEO John Mara saying in Orlando: “I want him to be a Giant. I can’t promise that’s going to happen.” Then it was the Rams doing nothing to debunk the rumors of their interest. Then it was Beckham, according to the New York Daily News, telling Rams players he would like to play there. Here’s what I think now: The Rams are definitely interested. The price tag—likely two first-round picks plus a contract averaging at least $18 million a year—is daunting and could eventually road-block L.A., but that’s not happening now. If the Giants move Beckham, the Rams will be in the game until the end.
There’s no way Giants coach Pat Shurmur would want Beckham traded; Shurmur took the job in January believing he’d have Beckham as his biggest weapon. Shurmur’s desire isn’t going to be what decides this, but it’s a factor. On the other hand, Rams coach Sean McVay isn’t afraid of taking on the mercurial Beckham.
This isn’t an easy one to decipher. The Giants already have a short fuse with the immature Beckham. He lives in Los Angeles in the offseason and could make it very hard on the Giants and their rookie head coach by not showing up for any of the offseason work, and holding out well into the summer. They may decide he’s not worth the trouble, and take two low first-rounders for him, and save all that cap money they’d have to pay him long-term—realizing full well it’s a deal they could soon regret. Look at GM Dave Gettleman’s history in Carolina. He had a big veteran star, Josh Norman, about to be a contract-related distraction for the Panthers in 2016. Gettleman’s solution was simply to cut him loose. If you told Gettleman he could get two first-round picks for a huge headache … well, I don’t have to draw you a map.
I’d feel more confident that the Giants would dump Beckham, except for one thing: I covered the Giants in the ’80s, and I remember how Giants scion Wellington Mara, John’s father, overlooked all the headaches the great Lawrence Taylor gave the franchise for years, because of his transcendent talent. I saw Wellington Mara get emotional with Taylor after he played a heroic 1987 game. Mara knew how important Taylor was to his team. John Mara is very much like his father. So there’s that. This one’s a conundrum.
Yes, Beckham is worth two ones. The narrative in some NFL quarters that Beckham is not worth two first-round draft picks in trade—especially two late first-round picks, as would likely be the case if the Rams traded with the Giants. Check out the first-round receivers in the last three years, many of whom have “bust” written all over them:
Beckham was hurt in game four last year, his fourth NFL season. His average season for the first three years—96 catches, 1,374 yards, 12 touchdowns—was historic.
My point about Beckham’s value isn’t that because 12 of the 13 receivers picked in the last three first rounds have been underwhelming the Rams should overpay for Beckham. It’s that recent history says the value of first-round receivers is not good. And if you’re desperate for a receiver, and Beckham, 25, is in the pool, why wouldn’t you consider paying two low first-rounders—as the Rams would have to—in order to make a serious bid for a premier player?
“I think the quarterback class is a hair overrated.” So says former NFL quarterback Chris Simms, now a Bleacher Report analyst. I asked him to rate this class of quarterbacks, in first-round order, and he had some interesting thoughts. His list:
1. Josh Allen, Wyoming
            2. Josh Rosen, UCLA
            3. Baker Mayfield, Oklahoma
            4. Lamar Jackson, Louisville
            5. Sam Darnold, USC
Notable, obviously, is Darnold’s placement. “The most confusing thing to me is that Sam Darnold is definitely the number one or two pick by everyone,” Simms said. “I am not trying to be a jerk to the kid, but the skill set I see on the field doesn’t relate to a can’t-miss prospect. I don’t think there’s anything he does elite physically. He’s toward the bottom as a thrower of the football, and he’s careless with the football.”
Simms on Allen: “He’s got elite arm talent, a [Brett] Favre or [Pat] Mahomes arm. Elite athlete for his size, like Carson Wentz. People talk about his accuracy, but his pass-protection was poor, and he had the worst talent around him of any of these guys.” He likes Jackson, but, as most draft observers say, Jackson is hurting himself by not being available to do the pre-draft things franchise quarterbacks need to be available to do. “But he’s got the biggest upside of anyone in the class,” Simms said.
The Josh McDaniels rule should not be called the Josh McDaniels rule—and I doubt it’ll ever pass anyway. I could never figure this out. McDaniels, the New England offensive coordinator, and the Colts had an understanding in mid-January that he’d become their coach after the last Patriots game of the year. When he jilted Indianapolis on Feb. 6 and told them he wanted to stay in New England, the Colts were ticked off. But as GM Chris Ballard told me at the time, “We’re glad we found out now. I wouldn’t have wanted a guy who wasn’t all in.” So at the league meetings, it was bizarre to me that owners wanted to pass a rule that would allow teams to hire head coaches before the end of a coach’s season, using the Colts’ situation as a spur. The Colts didn’t want the rule; they would have voted against it had it come to a vote.
Suppose this rule existed this year, and suppose the Colts and McDaniels announce they had a deal … and then, after the last game of the season, McDaniels decided he’d rather stay with the Patriots. Then you’d have had a real mess.
Neither solution is ideal. But I think the current rule is better than a coach signing with a new team, then continuing to coach his team through the playoffs.
The debate on this was interesting in Orlando. As someone in the meeting told me, 10 coaches spoke, and nine supported keeping the rule the way it is. Bill Belichick was the leader of the status-quo, according to my source. “Bill said, ‘We work hard to get to the playoffs. We tell our fans we’re doing everything possible to win the biggest games of the year, and we do everything to eliminate distractions. And then, in the middle of that, we announce one of our coaches is now the new coach of another team? And he’s going to coach for us until the end of the year?’ Bill also made a very good point about being employed by two teams at once. ‘If you’ve been hired by one team, you’re continuing to coach your original team, and you talk to some of the assistant coaches you work with about joining your staff—shouldn’t that be tampering?’”
The process needs to slow down anyway. It’s ridiculous that coach-seeking teams spend three or four hours interviewing the hot coach of the postseason, do some investigation into the guy, and then see other teams drooling over the same guy, and get pressured into making a deal with the coach. As one club exec told me in Orlando, the Yankees took four or five weeks to pick their manager last fall. Who knows if Aaron Boone’s the right guy? But the Yankees had plenty of time to figure it out.

“Those guys have been in the war room a lot longer than I have. They’ve done an excellent job so far in the offseason. I keep seeing Sam Darnold’s name up there for the number one pick. But I think they’re gonna do what’s best. We got one and four [the first and fourth overall picks]. Lotta great players in this draft. Saquon Barkley’s one of them. Minkah Fitzpatrick, oh, lotta guys.”

“It’s a place where quarterbacks go to die.”

“There were times when I was on the sideline and I just wanted to go up to Belichick or Matt Patricia and just say, ‘Is this how we’re gonna end this?’ I grew up in the Patriots system … I was close to going up and saying what I wanted to say to Matt or Belichick … I really wanted to go ask ’em, but I didn’t.”

“It’s not meant to fix minutiae. Just as players make mistakes, officials are going to make mistakes and coaches are going to make mistakes. This is not a video game. It is a game played, officiated and coached by humans. It is what it is. We need to think about replay as something that makes sure we get the obvious error corrected but not destroy what is the game by making it a video game.” 
—Retiring referee Jeff Triplette, on instant replay, to Jonathan Jones of The MMQB in our “Exit Interview” series.
That is about as common-sense a view of replay as I’ve heard.

“I would imagine Deacon Jones was pretty unhappy when they outlawed the head slap. That’s how he learned to play the game—it was a technique then. But that was change that was necessary at the time. This is change now. Change is hard. It’s not for punishment, it’s for protection.”
—Competition Committee chairman Rick McKay, on the rule passed at the NFL meetings last week outlawing a player lowering his helmet and using it to strike another player.
There’s a lot of pressure on Chiefs sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with the departure of the reliable Alex Smith in trade and the signing of projected Kansas City backup quarterbacks Chad Henne and Matt McGloin.
In the last four seasons, Henne and McGloin have combined to start four games. Their record in those games: 0-4.
The only quarterback on the Chiefs roster to have won an NFL game in the last four years is Mahomes. He has won one.
Comments from the 32 NFL coaches and GMs in the league’s general session when the ballyhooed catch rule was presented for discussion at the NFL meetings, and then passed by a 32-0 vote: zero.
For football people, changing the rule that has tormented the game for so long was easy, because everything had been said. There was such a minuscule chance to stand in the way of the freight train that was the new catch rule that no one wanted to waste his breath.
Still, no comments? No discussion? Noteworthy.
In five fewer games this season, Taylor Hall (37) has nine more goals than Sidney Crosby (28).

Football, as we know it, is being overhauled.

Samuel L. Jackson just strolled through the media workroom, on his way out of the Alamodome. Didn't seem interested in sitting down with us and knocking out a sidebar.
From “The MMQB Podcast With Peter King,’’ available where you download podcasts.
This week’s conversations, from the NFL owners meetings in Orlando: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur and Peter Schrager, reporter for FOX and host for “Good Morning Football.”
• Schrager on the burgeoning rivalry between the Rams and Niners, and between young coaches Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan: “I spent a lot of time with both organizations down here; they are competitive as hell with each other, the head coaches are as close friends and as competitive rivals as you'll find in the NFL. McVay was the tight ends coach under Kyle Shanahan and now is the coach of the year, belle of the ball. Meanwhile Kyle just got his dream quarterback in Jimmy Garoppolo, and there's a healthy friendship there. They're still friends for sure—I've been with them where they interact and stuff—but boy, they want to beat each other. And the NFL, it's been a couple years since those two franchises have been at the peak of their game. I cannot wait over the next five years to see how it all plays out, because the GMs are young, the coaches are young, the quarterbacks are young, and the fan bases are both so hungry for it. I think Rams-Niners could end up being Steelers-Ravens over the next 10 years.
“There was a Week 17 game between the Niners and the Rams, and neither one of these guys would say it on the record and neither one of them has said it to me personally. I just know. The Niners gave it to the Rams. [San Francisco 34, Los Angeles 13.] The Rams were putting their second string guys in, they were already looking forward to Atlanta—the Niners rolled up that score and they ended their season five straight wins and they went into the Coliseum and blew out the Rams, and it might have been their backups, but McVay won't forget that. And I love that stuff.”
1. I think the NFL, which treated any mention of anthem-related protests like the plague at the league meetings, is going to continue to have issues no matter how thoroughly the discussion of it is swept under the rug.
2. I think it’s only going to get worse if no team signs Colin Kaepernick friend and fellow protester Eric Reid, who is an above-average player with opinions. Let him have them. And let him play.
3. I think I wish Mike Ornstein, a longtime league staple and the most colorful character I’ve met covering this game, the best as he fights an infection stemming from a kidney stone at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He’s had some starry visitors in the past few days—Sean Payton and Isaiah Thomas on Friday. Ornstein was at one point Al Davis’ right-hand man with the Raiders and lately a great friend to the Saints.
4. I think the fight for Jim Kelly goes on—a 12-hour surgery Wednesday in New York to remove his cancerous jaw and lymph nodes, and reconstruct the jaw using one of his femur bones. Three times in four years Kelly has thrown haymakers at this insidious disease. All of western New York, and the rest of the football world, hopes this is the time that doctors got it all.
5. I think, by the way, we’ve got an excellent series of draft preview shows available on Amazon—“The MMQB Draft Preview Show with Pro Football Focus.” I watched the running back show over the weekend, and until seeing it, I thought Saquon Barkley was flawless. He is not, our PFF panelists say. Interesting, too, how much they love Michigan defensive lineman Maurice Hurst, his health issues and all. Really good education here.
6. I think the Marquette King cut by the Raiders was stunning—he’s one of the top five punters in the NFL—until you realize the cash-strapped Raiders can save $2.9 million in cap money this year. I think GM Reggie McKenzie figures, and probably correctly, that of all the moves he could make, cutting the punter and paying a young punter the NFL minimum is the best of some bad alternatives.
7. I think this is the Good NFL Nugget of the Week, from Tom Pelissero of NFL Network: Desperado quarterback Paxton Lynch of the Broncos has enlisted the training help of Tom Brady body guru Alex Guerrero to prepare him for the 2018 season. Smart of Lynch to pull out all the stops to evade the bust label. This season is it for him in Denver.
8. I think it’s not probable but certainly possible to think that the Giants could make two trades before the draft: with the Rams for Odell Beckham Jr., and with Buffalo for the second pick in the draft. Let’s say New York did that. And let’s say New York, in return, got two first-round picks from the Rams and three first-round picks from Buffalo. Three? Three! For Buffalo to move from 12 to two in this year’s first round, and to get a top quarterback prospect, the Bills, I believe, would have to deal the 12th and 22nd picks this year, plus their first-rounder next year. How interesting would that be? It would give the Giants quantity, and allow them to own the next two first rounds. As you see here:
• In 2018, the Giants would have Buffalo’s 12th and 22nd overall picks, and the Rams’ 23rd. So three picks in the top 23.
• In 2019, the Giants would have their own first-round pick, Buffalo’s first-round pick, and the Rams’ first-round pick.
Obviously, in order for the Giants to even consider doing these deals, they’d have to believe they could eschew a drafted quarterback this year and Eli Manning would give them two more strong years (he’s slipped in recent seasons), and they’d have to have a willing partner in the Bills. Buffalo would have to be willing to denude the top of its next two drafts to get the quarterback it wants. I don’t expect both things to happen, but the Giants could do something historic this year.
9. I think teams should not be afraid of Baker Mayfield.
10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:
a. Video of the Week: From the digital arm of the Arizona Republic … Of everything I saw or read in the past week, this had the most impact on me. It’s a teacher in Arizona, with two masters degrees, protesting her pay. It’s heartbreaking. We have to pay teachers a good, sustainable, living wage, with the chance for some savings,, that reflects their incredible value to our society. Watch and share.
b. Story of the Week: Wow, wow, wow, Michael McKnight and Greg Bishop of Sports Illustrated. What a story about internet trolls trolling players and officials viciously.
c. This is a great paragraph in the McKnight/Bishop story, concerning a troll from Kentucky who wrote on the Facebook page of the wife of NCAA basketball ref John Higgins after the ref’s performance in a University of Kentucky basketball loss, blasting the ref. SI found the troll and reached out to him by phone. Contacted at work and asked if he has a few moments to discuss the Higgins matter, he lowers his voice to a whisper and, retreating beneath his figurative bridge, says, “No. No, I don’t.”
d. When I grow up, I want to be able to write a paragraph like that.
e. Great job by KHQ-TV in Spokane, with a revealing, startling look at the mental health issues suffered by former NFL quarterback Mark Rypien. The most emotional stuff is about how Rypien encouraged his daughter Angela to be a quarterback, and she played, and she’s been having issues of her own, perhaps because of the head trauma suffered in the game. Well worth your time.
f. Really good work by KHQ anchor Stephanie Vigil. That’s a tough interview to do, and she asked the right questions.
g. Rypien to Vigil: “If I can save one life by this interview, then I feel like I am doing my legacy.”
h. Coffeenerdness: I respected the kind of reporter Peter Schrager is, and the stories he has broken in his time with FOX and “Good Morning Football,” before he showed up in my hotel room in Orlando on Tuesday afternoon to record this week’s podcast. But I did not realize what a bloodhound he is, and how dogged and resourceful he is, until he reached out when I opened the door and handed me a coffee from Starbucks. “Wh-wh-what?” I stammered. That was certainly thoughtful. But then I find that’s not just just drip coffee—it’s my new usual, a triple grande smoked butterscotch latte. I demanded to know how he knew. “I’m a reporter,” he said. He wouldn’t give up his source, a practice of good reporters. Darn impressive, Mr. Schrager.
i. The Miami Marlins have eight uber-attractive home games this season: four against the Cubs, two against the Red Sox, two against the Yankees. Six will be finished tomorrow: the four Cubs games that opened the season and the two against Boston that followed. That leaves two against the Yankees, on Aug. 21 and 22, remaining.
j. Interesting scheduling.
k. You go, Nick Ahmed.
l. You go, Joe Panik.
m. I see the Dodgers have their hitting shoes on.
n. Happy Easter and Happy Passover, everyone.
o. I miss malted milk eggs, the greatest Easter candy in history.
p. I’ll miss Loyola, but the right two teams are in the championship game tonight. Give me Villanova 62, Michigan 57.
The Gronk returneth.
            Patriot Nation, joyous.
            Vince McMahon. He's blue.

It’s Week 25 of the NBA season, which also happens to be the last full week of the regular season. That’s right, the playoffs are less than two weeks away, and in 10 days we’ll know which teams will be in the postseason and which teams can get an early start on their summer.
There’s not a ton of movement in the rankings this week, and it’s only getting harder to separate squads thanks to logjams in both conferences. If you need a quick snapshot: The Pelicans are in trouble, the Celtics, Sixers and Pacers are hot, and the bottom three teams in the East’s playoff bracket are driving everybody insane.
Here’s how the entire NBA stacks up headed into the actual, honest-to-god homestretch.
30. Phoenix Suns (19–59)Last Week: 30
29. Sacramento Kings (25–53)Last Week: 24
28. Orlando Magic (22–54)Last Week: 23
27. Dallas Mavericks (23–54)Last Week: 29
26. New York Knicks (27–50)Last Week: 22
​​
25. Memphis Grizzlies (21–56)Last Week: 28
24. Atlanta Hawks (22–55)Last Week: 25
23. Brooklyn Nets (25–52)Last Week: 26
22. Chicago Bulls (26–51)Last Week: 27
The Bulls and Grizzlies have played a little spoiler down the stretch, but otherwise not much is happening here. The Suns have lost 15 in a row. Frank Vogel kept his beard for an entire season. And the Nets would be better than the 2016 Warriors if they played the Heat every game. It is exciting to hear Dirk Nowitzki wants to return for a 21st season with the Mavericks. Maybe the organization will do him the favor of putting a competitive team on the court.
21. Charlotte Hornets (34–44)Last Week: 19
The Hornets have struggled with Frank Kaminsky on the court this season, performing five points per 100 possessions better without the former Wisconsin star. With substantial money committed to Dwight Howard and Cody Zeller in Charlotte, I’m curious if someone will try to swoop in and steal Frank this summer and see if he can take his career to another level elsewhere. The Hornets may have to start parting with prospects to clear their loaded cap sheet.
20. Los Angeles Lakers (33–43)Last Week: 20
The Lakers are a lot less fun to watch when both Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram are missing from action. L.A. doesn’t really have anything to play for over the season’s last 10 days, and they aren’t really sneaking up on anyone at this point. The next time this team will be interesting is late June.
19. Detroit Pistons (37–40) Last Week: 21
The good news? The Pistons have won five in a row. The bad news? The last three of those wins have come without Blake Griffin, perhaps suggesting Detroit’s two-big experiment with Griffin and Andre Drummond isn’t quite going to work. Griffin is probably best suited to play center at this point in his career, raising some serious questions about how Detroit should move forward with its roster.
18. Los Angeles Clippers (41–36)Last Week: 15
The Clips are just barely hanging on in the West playoff race, though their chances are dwindling. L.A. is still good for a nightly highlight, however, thanks to the pregame dance routine of Boban Maranjovic, DeAndre Jordan and Tobias Harris.
17. New Orleans Pelicans (43–34)Last Week: 12
New Orleans has lost four in a row, and the Boogie Cousins injury may finally be catching up to the Pelicans. Anthony Davis and Co. will have a chance to make up some ground this week, though—New Orleans will face the Suns, Grizzlies and wounded Warriors over the next six days.
T-16. Washington Wizards (42–35)Last Week: 18
T-16. Milwaukee Bucks (41–36)  Last Week: 17
T-16. Miami Heat (41–36) Last Week: 16
I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired about these three teams. The Heat, Bucks and Wizards are basically the same at this point. Each of them trade flashes of competence—brilliance, even—with maddening losses to terrible teams. Saturday, the Heat lost to the Nets for the third time this year. The Wizards lost to the Bulls and Pistons last week. And the Bucks hilariously blew a huge lead to Denver on Sunday, somehow losing a game they led by eight with less than a minute to go.
John Wall is back in action in D.C., though it looks like it will take him a few games to get re-acclimated. The Heat are playing substantially better without Hassan Whiteside these days, but the mercurial big is now openly complaining about his minutes. Meanwhile, the Bucks still turn into a glorified G-League unit every time Giannis sits on the bench.
Only a game separates these teams in the standings, as they battle to make up the order of the last three playoff spots in the East. Don’t waste your time looking at the upcoming schedules for these squads, because they can lose to even the worst of opponents. However the Heat, Wiz and Bucks end up finishing in the standings, I’ll just be glad when it’s over.
13. Denver Nuggets (42–35)Last Week: 14
Denver finally finished its hellish seven-game road trip last week and will play three of its last five at home. Jamal Murray practically saved the Nuggets’ season Sunday night with his amazing effort in the epic comeback win over Milwaukee. I still think the future is bright here, and Mike Malone deserves another year with this group even if they don’t make the playoffs. Denver’s last five games are going to be tough, and the Gary Harris injury will increase the degree of difficulty. At the very least, I’m sure the Nugs will find a way to keep things interesting.
12. Minnesota Timberwolves (44–34)Last Week: 13
Here’s how March went for the Wolves: L3, W2, L2, W2, L2, W2, and then a loss to start April. Jimmy Butler has been cleared for contact, but it’s still uncertain when he will return to the lineup. Minny has clearly been streaky without its star player. With two games left against a desperate Nuggets team—who trail the Wolves by 1 1/2 games—expect a furious finish to the season here.
11. Oklahoma City Thunder (45–33)  Last Week: 7
The Thunder have looked a little shaky over the last week, but their last three losses were by a combined eight points. With a fairly soft closing schedule, OKC shouldn’t really be in panic mode. If anything, a drop to the seventh seed—and a first-round matchup with the Steph-less Warriors—could be fortuitous for the Thunder.
10. Utah Jazz (44–33)Last Week:10
Ricky Rubio scored 23 points (with five threes!) in a revenge game against the Wolves on Sunday. The Jazz’s defense will give any opponent trouble in the playoffs. A lottery pick would have been nice, but I’m excited to see what Donovan Mitchell can do come the postseason, and what impact that experience will have on his promising career.
9. Golden State Warriors (56–21)Last Week: 11
The cavalry is coming. Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson were both in action Sunday as the Dubs dispatched the Suns to win their second straight. Of course, all that matters for this team is winning a championship, and those hopes rest of Steph Curry’s knee. My colleagues Ben Golliver and Andrew Sharp had a really interesting discussion about that injury and its fallout on the Open Floor podcast. (Don’t worry, my editors transcribed it for you.)
8. San Antonio Spurs (45–32)Last Week: 8
Another week, another bit of Kawhi drama overshadowing San Antonio’s surge back into the top half of the West. Gregg Popovich saying Leonard’s return depends on when Kawhi and “his group” feel he’s ready was pretty ominous. This is one of the strangest plotlines involving a superstar of Kawhi’s caliber for as long as I can remember. Will the Spurs just forget all of this if Leonard returns healthy next season? Does San Antonio still want him long-term? Whatever the case is for the future, I’m ready to bet Leonard won’t have much of an impact at all this season, be it now or in the playoffs.
7. Toronto Raptors (55–21)Last Week: 5
Hmmm, the Raptors are looking a little creaky. Toronto has alternated wins and losses since March 16, and the inconsistent play means the Raptors have only a two-game lead for first place in the East. Toronto’s upcoming week is huge, with games against the Cavs, Celtics and Pacers on deck. It wouldn’t be the Raptors if they didn’t inject a bit of uneasiness into their feel-good ride. Losing the one seed could be a significant blow to this team’s psyche, though.
6. Cleveland Cavaliers (47–30)Last Week: 4
The Cavs have won three in a row, but their next three will come against East playoff teams. Kevin Love has made a huge impact since his return from injury on March 19—Cleveland has an 11.3 net rating with Love on the floor in that time. In 151 minutes together after Love’s return, the Cavs have a 17.9 net rating when Love and LeBron share the floor.
5. Portland Trail Blazers (48–29)Last Week: 6
Portland has won four of five after a brief two-game losing streak. More importantly, this Jusuf Nurkic tweet is begging to be turned into a hot meme.
4. Indiana Pacers (46–31)Last Week: 9
Indy has won five in a row and is only one game out of the three seed in the East. And as former Cavs GM David Griffin points out, the Pacers aren’t only beating up on bad teams. Indy has the third-highest winning percentage against playoff teams since the All-Star break.
3. Boston Celtics (53–23)Last Week: 3
The Celtics are red hot, winners of six in a row despite seemingly a new injury every night. Boston is right on the heels of Toronto for first place in the East, something that seemed wrapped up a week ago. I said it before but I think it bears repeating: Don’t tank yourself into a first-round matchup with this team. The Celtics keep finding ways to win, and they are going to be a pain in the a-- in the playoffs no matter who is on the floor.
2. Philadelphia 76ers (46–30)Last Week: 2
Now the hottest team in the NBA. The Sixers have won 10 in a row and their last victory came without the services of Joel Embiid. If there’s a silver lining in the Embiid injury, it’s that it was a freak accident that shouldn’t have any long-term issues. If there’s another silver lining, it’s that the injury gives Ben Simmons a chance to exert control over the team and learn how to carry the roster by himself. An Embiid return will be vital for a deep playoff run, but Simmons is much better equipped now than earlier in the season to keep Philly competitive.
1. Houston Rockets (62–15)Last Week: 1
Homecourt throughout the playoffs—that’s an accomplishment big enough to keep the Rockets at No. 1 in the Power Rankings. Now it’s just a matter of Daryl Morey convincing Mike D’Antoni to rest his key guys as much as possible.

              Why try to keep the intelligence test scores private in the first place?
            
            
It must be that time of year. Over the weekend, the supposedly confidential Wonderlic scores leaked for the 2018 draft quarterbacks, as they seem to do every spring. The unconfirmed scores have probably been used as the backbone of a thousand online arguments by now, while the true numbers are being used similarly across the league. And yet, it's still unclear if the results have any true predictive value.
The Wonderlic test predates World War II and has been used in the NFL for over 40 years, at once simple—12 minutes to complete 50 multiple choice questions—and inscrutable, a single score taken as a stand-in for intelligence. Because the full results are never published, a complete analysis of the test's effectiveness is impossible, but studies conducted using the (copious) leaked information have often found no direct link between score and career. Even Eldon Wonderlic's daughter has reportedly said, ""The first time I heard they were using it, I had to laugh.""
NFL decision-makers defend the results as a useful piece of a larger puzzle, a jumping off point for further research or validation for observations made during film-study and interviews. Maybe they use them as a tie-break between prospects. Or maybe they even steer away from players who do too well on the tests. (As former Giants GM Jerry Reese once said, ""You have to watch out for the smart ones."")
There's only one way for us to know the real value of the numbers, and that's for us to get all of them, at least for top prospects. Faced with the mountain of evidence, fans will have to accept that there are far too many exceptions on both ends of the spectrum to assume the number ends any debate about a prospect's potential, while doubters could finally be handed real proof for the significant correlations the results might include.
Of course, this is the NFL we're talking about it, so don't just imagine a data dump. The league could turn the test-taking into a couple days worth of programming, at least, with a B-list celebrity host/proctor and an uncomfortable amount of game show shtick. Journalists and take-artists are already making hay off what could be insignificant data. The league might as well, too.

2. ""I suffer from a complex stew of mental health conditions,"" Super Bowl and Pro Bowl quarterback Mark Rypien says. ""Dark places, depression, anxiety, addictions, poor choices, poor decisions, brought about by dozens of concussions and thousands of sub-concussive injuries from playing this sport.""

5. With each passing inscrutable Instagram message, it becomes more difficult to envision a long-term harmonious relationship between the Steelers and Le'Veon Bell. Thursday he wrote, ""It’s so hard to be a hero in a city that paints you out to be the villain.""
6. Why do the Bengals keep sticking with Vontaze Burfict? ""Our over-riding thought is how to field the best football team,"" director of player personnel Duke Tobin said.

Popular belief is the Giants will draft a quarterback at No. 2 and develop him behind Eli Manning for a year or two. But recent history says it wouldn’t go that way. In the last 12 years, exactly zero first-round quarterbacks have sat as rookies and gone on to become a franchise guy.
The last first-rounder to do it was Aaron Rodgers, who fell into Green Bay’s lap in 2005. Plenty of teams since have drafted guys with the plan to groom them from the bench, but that’s not how it plays out. Either the team impatiently rushes the rookie onto the field, or the rookie toils from the bench and busts. Maybe Patrick Mahomes will break the trend in Kansas City; we won’t know for a few years.
This isn’t to say the Giants shouldn’t take a QB at No. 2 if there’s one they absolutely love. But the notion that doing so would be the responsible long-term approach is false. In fact, drafting a developmental QB would be about the riskiest thing they could do. It’d be much safer to draft with a “win now” perspective.
The Giants are in more of a “win now” territory than perhaps any team that’s ever earned a No. 2 pick. Two years ago, they went 11-5 and made the playoffs. Last season they fell apart when the entire receiving corps got hurt and their once-dominant defense started blowing coverages. Overall roster talent was not the issue.
New general manager Dave Gettleman, like predecessor Jerry Reese, believes in building through your defensive line. (In 2016 with Carolina, Gettleman even used his first-round pick on defensive tackle Vernon Butler, despite having 2013 first-and second-round stud defensive tackles Star Lotulelei and Kawann Short.) Gettleman believes you can never have too many D-linemen—and after trading Jason Pierre-Paul to Tampa Bay, his Giants currently don’t even have enough.
Exacerbating the Giants’ 2017 coverage woes was their anemic four-man rush. Pierre-Paul was part of that. He’s a superb run defender but only a good-not-great pass rusher. The same is true of the D-line’s remaining stars, Olivier Vernon, Damon Harrison and rising second-year man Dalvin Tomlinson. N.C. State defensive end Bradley Chubb could be a crucial missing piece for the Giants. New defensive coordinator James Bettcher, a believer in aggressive and complex blitzing, is a little less dependent on a four-man rush than predecessor Steve Spagnuolo was, but Bettcher also learned in Arizona—where he had Chandler Jones—the value of having a dominant edge presence.
Besides needing help defensively, there’s also the matter of New York’s quarterback still being viable. If you just watched Manning on film, you wouldn’t know if he was 31 or 36 years old last year. His arm, like it has always been, is strong enough. His numbers were poor in ’17 and, by some metrics, just so-so in ’16, but many times in his career Manning has been better than his stats suggest. As a quarterback who controls games at the line of scrimmage and plays (most of the time) on schedule, he’s right for new head coach Pat Shurmur’s system.
The argument for the Giants taking a quarterback is that they likely won’t be at the top of the draft again any time soon, that this is their opportunity to strike. And maybe there’s something to that. But Gettleman could reason that they won’t soon be just a piece or two away from NFC East contention again, either. And, not to imply that Gettleman wouldn’t do what’s best for the franchise—be it build for the short-term or long-term—but at 67 years old and having won an NFC championship with the Panthers just three years ago, what’s likelier: that he arrived to help the Giants lay a new foundation, or that he’s here to push them over the top?
This year’s quarterback class is fascinating because, except for Josh Rosen, all the potential first-rounders feature mobility as a crucial part of their games. What NFL teams must figure out is: Just how crucial? A QB can run his way to success in college. In the NFL, however, his mobility cannot be his house’s biggest load-bearing wall (so to speak). A pro QB still must be able to play on schedule within the pocket. Identifying which mobile ones can and can’t is difficult.
• RAMS ADD SUH, BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN: Andy Benoit breaks down the new-look Rams D.
If #Jets really LOVE the QBs at the top of this draft they wouldn’t have gone after Kirk Cousins.
Yes, I’m coming back to this tweet again because a high-ranking member of the Jets, whom I really respect, approached me at Josh Allen’s pro day with a “bone to pick.”
NYJ Guy: Just because we went after Kirk doesn’t mean we don’t like these rookie quarterbacks.
Me: Love, do you love these rookie QBs?
NYJ: Yes, love.
Me: But then why would you pay $90 million over three years for Kirk if you can get one of the quarterbacks you love on a rookie deal for around $20 million over four years?
NYJ: Have you seen our cap situation?
Me: So you’re saying money is less of an object than usual?
NYJ: Correct.
We could have a philosophical discussion about whether it’s wise to spend big money just because you have it—there are arguments for both sides. You could also argue that for New York’s trade with Indy to make sense, there’d have to be three quarterbacks they love, since they’ve only moved up to third in the draft. How often does a team fall in love with three different quarterbacks the same year?
But—and here’s the main reason I wanted to revisit this tweet—thinking later about the conversation with the Jets guy, I realized I overlooked something: The rookie quarterbacks don’t just cost the Jets $20 million over four years, they cost the Jets $20 million over four years plus three second-round draft picks, since that’s what New York gave up to climb from No. 6 to No. 3. The Jets guy alluded to this, saying, “If we’d signed Kirk, we’d then use our picks to build around him.”
It still feels like the Jets are making a mad scramble for a QB. Some might call that reaching—particularly if you believe ownership is provoking it. But as another person at the Josh Allen pro day said to me, “Can you blame them? In the NFL, you gotta do whatever you can to find that QB.”
The best part of going on a double-date is talking about the other couple afterwards on the drive home.

The week’s 10 biggest stories in the NFL, and the impact of each...
10. Johnny Manziel eyes comeback
Newly married and sober, Johnny Football worked out at Texas A&M’s pro day and spent extra time meeting with the Patriots. 
Here’s hoping Manziel stays on track and leads a fulfilling life. But from a pure football standpoint, even if he does, understand that this by no means makes him a potential NFL starter … or even backup. Besides not having played in 2 ½ years, Manziel’s style is not a natural fit for the NFL. For a pro QB, mobility must be an appetizer, not an entrée. As a Cleveland Brown, defenses giddily gameplanned to keep Manziel in the pocket, where he struggled to overcome his limited height (i.e. vision) and meager arm strength. It’s foolish to think that Manziel might one day be Tom Brady’s heir. The Patriots take unconventional chances, yes. But they win Super Bowls because they only play with guys who can, you know, actually play.
• JOHNNY MANZIEL OPENS UP: The quarterback was contrite in a Q&A as he tries to work his way back to the NFL.
9. Andrew Luck is throwing
Colts head coach Frank Reich told the media that the star quarterback is throwing the football again and is expected to be with the team at offseason conditioning starting April 9.
With Indy’s failures and Luck’s absence, it’s easy to overlook how significant this is. Luck is a top 5 quarterback. If he’s healthy, the Colts are contenders in what’s shaping up to be a loaded AFC South.
8. Cardinals trade Jared Veldheer to the Broncos
The eight-year offensive tackle, who is experienced on both the left and right side, goes to Denver for a sixth-round pick. 
This is small news for Arizona; 2015 first-round pick D.J. Humphries has become their left tackle and recently-signed free agents Justin Pugh and Andre Smith can both play guard or tackle. For Denver, it’s potentially big news if Veldheer is here to compete for snaps on the left side. That would suggest a deep dissatisfaction with last year’s first-round tackle Garett Bolles, who had an up-and-down rookie season. Most likely, Veldheer is here to stabilize matters at right tackle, where the Broncos were a turnstile in 2017.
7. Broncos trade for Su’a Cravens
The Broncos essentially got the safety, Washington’s 2016 second-rounder, for a fifth-round pick. (The full trade: Washington receives 2018 4th (109 overall), 2018 5th (142 overall), 2018 5th (163 overall), conditional pick in 2020; Denver receives Cravens, 2018 4th (113 overall), 2018 5th (149 overall.)
Cravens was M.I.A. due to injuries and personal reasons in 2017, and his NFL future at this point doesn’t appear to be one you’d eagerly bet on. If he can fulfill his potential, however, the Broncos will have scored a young new age hybrid linebacker/safety, a la Mark Barron for the Rams or Deone Bucannon in Arizona. Players like that do a lot for your rotations and nickel/dime sub-packages.
6. Browns say they will start Tyrod Taylor all year
Cleveland coach Hue Jackson said the team is close to a consensus on who to take at the top of the draft, but they plan to be “very disciplined” in sitting that player behind Taylor for all of next season. 
Yeah, we’ll see. As I wrote this week in why the Giants shouldn’t take a QB at No. 2, the number of times in the last dozen years that a first-round QB has actually sat out his rookie season and then gone on to be that team’s long-term starter is zero. It hasn’t happened since the Packers drafted Aaron Rodgers in 2005. Brett Favre kept Rodgers on the bench. Tyrod Taylor, like 99% of the league’s other quarterbacks, isn’t Brett Favre.
5. Bennett Brothers in the news
Martellus retires, Michael turns himself in on charges of assaulting the elderly after allegedly shoving a 66-year-old paraplegic security guard to the ground following Super Bowl LI when he was trying to get on the field to congratulate his brother.
On Martellus, would you believe that over his 10-year career, he played for five teams and averaged just 43 catches and 457 yards receiving annually? Add in his stalwart blocking and you have a quality starter, but I would have guessed his statistical production was higher. (After leaving Dallas, where he underachieved as a backup to Jason Witten from 2008-’11, Bennett did average 58 catches and 621 yards a year. Still.)
On Michael, we need to learn more. There are questions to ask from many directions.
4. Kickoffs changed permanently, could soon be extinct
NFL owners voted to keep spotting kickoff touchbacks at the 25-yard line after testing the idea last year. Packers president Mark Murphy also said that if the coaches and players don’t figure out a way to make kickoffs safer, the play will be eradicated.
Removing kickoffs would kill two birds with one stone by making the game safer and by making it shorter. If kickoffs disappear, we’ve heard that the NFL would almost certainly replace the onside kick with an untimed fourth-and-10 situation for the “kicking” team. Fourth-and-10 feels a bit easy. The success rate for expected onside kicks is 15% (over the last three years, via Elias Sports). The league must find the fourth-down to-go distance that correlates with that. Fourth-and-10 conversions happen 22.7% of the time (over the last three years, via ProFootballReference; and 24.6% since 1994). Making it fourth-and-15 (15% last 3 years, via ProFootballReference; 16.2% since ’94) would be better.
3. Rams sign Suh
The L.A. Rams signed defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh to a one-year deal worth $14 million, creating a terrifying tandem with Aaron Donald. 
A great addition, but this still is not a totally complete defense.
2. OBJ on the trade block?
The Giants are reportedly asking for two first-round draft picks for the receiver after owner John Mara criticized Odell Beckham's off-season behavior and made it clear that no one on the team is “untouchable.”
After Mara spoke, Giants GM Dave Gettleman said, “You don’t quit on talent.” A lot of people cried hypocrisy, citing that Gettleman quit on Josh Norman when both were in Carolina. Josh Norman is not what Gettleman means by “talent.” Norman is a high-quality player. Beckham, from a talent standpoint, is generational. Guys like him come along maybe once every five years. That’s not to say he’s worth the headaches in New York (and let’s understand, there are almost certainly minor headaches he causes behind the scenes that never become public). But it is to say the Giants must tread very lightly when considering a separation. Beckham is one of the maybe dozen talents in pro football who change the entire makeup of both teams’ strategies simply by being on the field.
• BECKHAM DEAL MAKES SENSE FOR BOTH SIDES: Peter King on the Beckham-to-Rams rumors.
1. NFL bans helmet hits, adds targeting rule
There will now be a 15-yard penalty and possible ejection for any player who lowers his head and makes helmet-to-helmet contact with another player.
• TARGETING RULE EXPECTED TO BE A MINOR ADJUSTMENT: Albert Breer on what league insiders are saying about the controversial new rule.
Yes, this new rule will create leaguewide chaos for the beginning of the 2018 season. And there will be snippets of chaos after that, probably through ’19. Tough.
The NFL had no choice here. Besides the personal side of things (aiming to create long-lasting lives of comfort and wellness for players as opposed to lives riddled by the horrors of CTE), there’s the business side. Concussion concerns are toxic to the game’s future, and the bell could toll on it any day.
Picture this: Congressman Joe Jackass learns that early polling data shows his re-election is in question. I need some publicity, he thinks, Why not go after the NFL for all this head safety stuff? Imagine how great it’d be to wag a finger at Roger Goodell during a congressional hearing! The moral high ground would already be mine—I’m the pro-brain safety guy sermonizing about the health of the players, and especially our children and their future … Goodell, who people love to hate anyway, would be a hired apologist for a bunch of billionaires, forced to sit there and take it. Sure, I’d know little about the entirety of the issue (just like my predecessors in 2003 knew so little about steroids and the landscape of Major League Baseball), but that’s actually my advantage because asking oversimplified, misleading questions would frame the conversation in ways voters can understand. And, it’d force Goodell to bumble his way through answers, making me look powerful and imposing. It’s perfect! 
If the NFL isn’t proactive and aggressive on the head-safety issue, an outside party will be. And just like that, the league would risk losing all control of its own game.

731,"
Rex Ryan was surprised when the NFL approached him, asking if he’d go overseas to visit U.S. troops. “I was like, wow, really?” Next Monday, the colorful former head coach will headline a group going on a weeklong tour through Italy and Germany, visiting troops as part of the annual NFL-USO tour.
Before he leaves, The MMQB caught up with Ryan and talked all things NFL draft. It so happens that two of Ryan’s former teams—the Jets and the Bills—figure to be main players come draft day. In this edition of Talking Football, Ryan dishes on who the Jets should draft at No. 3, his opinion on the Bills’ moves this past year, and who should go in the top five picks of the draft.  
The MMQB: Your old team the Jets made an aggressive move trading up to No. 3. What do you think of the move? Do you think they’re going to take a quarterback?
Rex Ryan: I think it’s a great move. They get up to three—obviously they’re in love with three players in the draft. I think everybody is assuming it’s going to be a quarterback. Now it could be Saquon Barkley, too. They might say, hey, that’s one of the [top] three guys. It’s a win-win for the Jets. I like what they’ve done. They bring back Josh McCown, a veteran quarterback, and he can be a bridge guy if they do get a rookie quarterback in there.
It’s hard to win with rookie quarterbacks, as I know. I think I’m the only guy in NFL history who coached two rookies as starting quarterbacks with the same franchise [Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith]. That was something, but it’s not recommended! I think quarterback is probably where the Jets will go, but it could be the fact that they really love the running back as well.
The MMQB: Is there a quarterback who you think would fit well with the Jets?
Ryan: I don’t know [the prospects] as well as their scouts, but I love Josh Allen. He’s got a huge arm. I like the makeup of the young man. Sam Darnold, obviously, would be another one. Those are the two top guys in my opinion. I’m really high on Josh Allen. He reminds me of Ben Roethlisberger. He’s got the big arm. He’s a very good athlete. He’s got some movement skills. And I think he’s got the makeup of what you’re looking for in a quarterback.
The MMQB: You former quarterback Tyrod Taylor got traded to the Browns. What do you think of his situation there? How will he do in Cleveland?
Ryan: Tyrod’s a hell of a lot better quarterback than people give him credit for. He’s had the one of the best touchdown-to-interception ratios [2.83] in the history of the National Football League, so I think that bodes well for the Browns. You know, the Browns turn the ball over, their quarterbacks, whoever they’ve had, they seem not to understand that there’s a responsibility that you have, and that’s to protect your team. Tyrod Taylor understands it, and he has ability.
Remember, this guy hasn’t exactly been blessed with the best receiving corps. In Buffalo, when [Sammy] Watkins was healthy, that was a different story. When Sammy was healthy, Tyrod did a tremendous job. You had Robert Woods and [Watkins], and obviously that was great. But when he wasn’t there, we didn’t have the weapons.
Tyrod’s a leader. I think he’s going to surprise a lot of people. Now in Cleveland’s situation, they’re obviously going to take a quarterback. So he’s probably not going to get a true deal, but I think the whole league will see who this kid is—he’s going to be hard to run out of the building, I can promise you.
The MMQB: The Bills are sitting there at the No. 12 pick. They’re probably trying to trade up for a quarterback. What have you seen from the new regime and the overhaul in Buffalo?
Ryan: Well, I think statistically they don’t look very good from last year, but they went to the playoffs. When you win, that corrects everything. The defense went from 19th to 26th, and the offense went all the way to 29th. It looks like there’s room for improvement, without question. But the fact that they won, I think, number one, speaks volumes about Tyrod Taylor, but also, Sean McDermott’s found ways to win.
I like the fact that they’ve unloaded some money, some guys who weren’t fitting in the long-term plan. You don’t want to throw good money after bad money, and they were able to fix their [cap] situation. I think that bodes well for them.
I do expect them to make a huge offer to the Giants and move up to No. 2. And if I was them, I would take Josh Allen. You need to have a guy to throw the ball in windy conditions, and no one has a bigger arm than that kid.
The MMQB: How do you see the top five picks of the draft playing out? What’s your top-five mock draft?
Ryan: Well, I think Darnold goes No. 1. I don’t think there’s a doubt about that. And depending on who is there at that No. 2 position, you would think Josh Allen is the next pick. And then a lot of people like Josh Rosen. Maybe he goes high. But Barkley is certainly going to go.
The guard from Notre Dame [Quenton Nelson] is outstanding. You know, all the Giants talked about was building that offensive line and defensive line. That guy, could he be a Hall of Fame player? Yeah. But how much does the guy move the needle if you’re a guard? I get it, he’s outstanding. He reminds me of Steve Hutchinson. Obviously it’s going to be a great pick. He’s going to multiple Pro Bowls. But when you’re picking at No. 2, I think you really want a dynamic player.
The MMQB: Are you excited to be going on the USO trip? What’s going to be the nature of the trip this year?
Ryan: Absolutely, I’m excited to go over there. I’m excited to meet some of the people there and see what they go through. I’ve always had a huge appreciation of the military. Obviously my dad served in the Korean War. He was a Master Sergeant when he was 18 years old.
The MMQB: Did you father ever tell you stories about the Korean War?
Ryan: He told me a few stories. I talked to somebody who actually gave my dad the rank of master sergeant. He said that my dad wasn’t a good shot or anything, but what my dad did, when he went to war, he traded his weapon for a tank machine gun. He figured he wasn’t a great but shot, but that’s what he ended up doing. And he lugged that thing around forever.
Master sergeants would go on patrols, and they’d ask for volunteers and nobody’s hand would go up. But when my dad would ask for volunteers, every hand went up. There was something about my dad then that the troops respected. He was a guy that would lead from the front.

732,"
ORLANDO — There can’t be another mega-trade in the NFL this off-season, can there? There can if the Giants get pushed too far by Odell Beckham Jr., and if the Rams decide to pull out every stop to win a Super Bowl in 2018 or 2019.
I’m not predicting a trade of Beckham to the Rams. (But if you listen to The MMQB Podcast With Peter King this week, you’ll hear that one of my guests, Peter Schrager of FOX and Good Morning Football, is.) I am saying that, except for the objections of Giants coach Pat Shurmur—who told me definitively Tuesday at the annual NFL owners meetings he wants to coach Beckham—a trade of the superstar wideout to the Rams makes an awful lot of sense.
I can also tell you there has been discussion of a Beckham deal between the Giants and Rams, though it’s not serious yet. There are those within the league who know Rams or Giants people who believe strongly that this is more than a pipe dream, and that it could happen. NFL Network reported this week that Beckham, entering his fifth NFL season, wants a new contract now or he won’t report for offseason work or for the season. He’s due to make $8.46 million in the last year of his rookie deal. 
Let’s count the ways Beckham-to-the-Rams makes sense:
• Rams GM Les Snead told me on Tuesday that the next two years are when the team can fit a mega-salary or two into its salary cap. Quarterback Jared Goff is due to make $7.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively, in years three and four of his rookie contract, both of which will be five percent or less of the Rams’ cap each year. That’s great for quarterback cost control. While the quarterback is making reasonable money, Los Angeles could load up in 2018 and ‘19 by front-loading mega-deals with defensive tackle Aaron Donald and/or an expensive important addition like Beckham. Both would be in the $20-million-per-year average.
• The Rams have guts. Snead never met a trade he didn’t like. Already this offseason, he has acquired a new cornerback group, Aqib Talib and Marcus Peters, and an impact defensive tackle to play alongside Donald, Ndamukong Suh. With the loss of burner wideout Sammy Watkins in free agency, there is no question coach Sean McVay would love to add Beckham to the mix.
• Regarding the Beckham combustibility: I am told McVay would have no problem working with Beckham and does not fear the off-field distractions he brings. That stuff has been wearisome (that’s putting it mildly) to Giants brass. 
• Regarding the Dream Team comparisons: They’re real, and they’re spectacular, and the Rams seem willing to take on one more potential distraction. The Eagles brought in a slew of expensive and famous free agents in 2011, backup quarterback Vince Young dubbed it the “Dream Team,” and this collection of talent stumbled to an 8-8 record. Snead told me he’s not afraid of a starry team, and he thinks McVay can handle it.
• Beckham is a great player who may not fit the Giants’ conservative organization. Does a team trying to build a long-term team want to risk making its centerpiece a player who angers ownership with his immaturity?
• Schrager estimated a fair-value deal would be Beckham for two first-round picks from the Rams. Sounds heavy on the surface, but is it really? The Rams pick 23rd in this year’s first round, and it’s likely to think they’ll be in the same range of the bottom third of the draft next year too. Would the 23rd pick in 2018 and, say, the 27th pick in 2019 be reasonable for the Rams to pay and for the Giants to receive? Seems fair from both ends. If the Rams could trade two low ones and get a generational talent, that’s fair—assuming Beckham’s health and off-field behavior stay in line. If the Giants could have two ones in each of the next two drafts, GM Dave Gettleman could defend that as being the nucleus of the Giants’ next generation.

​
I don’t know if the Giants would accept two first-round picks for Beckham, though I bet they would. I don’t know if the Rams would offer two ones for Beckham, though I bet they would.
Stay tuned. The most interesting offseason in years, decades maybe, could have one final pre-draft bombshell.

Now for your email...
BOSELLI AND STINK CHECK IN ON THE NEWEST NEW RULE
After the owners voted 32-0 to make it a 15-yard foul to hit an opponent with the helmet after lowering your head, it soon became the talk of the league. Another example of the wussification of the game, the sentiment went. “Lowering the head to initiate contact with the helmet is a foul,” the Competition Committee proposed, and the rule won in a landslide.
Tweeted longtime left tackle Tony Boselli: “This will completely change the game.”
Tweeted longtime guard Mark Schlereth: “If this rule is enforced you’ll run out of players in the second quarter.”
I don’t know how the rule will play. I don’t know how the enforcement will be carried out. This rule happened because of the increase in documented concussions (from 244 in 2016 to 291 last season) and the NFL’s belief that all aggressive helmet use should be taken out of the game. And we’ll see—if accidental and insignificant fouls are called, I could change my tune. This rule is about the prevention of the helmet-as-battering-ram. I am cautiously optimistic that it will be good for the game long-term. Ryan Shazier suffered a spinal injury because he tackled leading with his head. But if the enforcement is truly blindsiding players, the NFL will need to adjust the rule. I find that players who have tackled like that for a few years have a difficult time adjusting. They’re going to have to.
BATHROOM PHONE HABITSSadly I’ve seen or heard this countless times [regarding the Travel Note on Monday, on the woman who would not get off the phone during dinner or, apparently, a restroom break] and like you I can’t handle it. To take it up a notch, there was a time I was in a restroom and heard not only a person in the stall talking, but also the clickity-clack of him typing on a laptop keyboard. Sometimes the priorities of the human race confuse me. Love your column… read it every Monday morning.—Mike, Michigan
Lord help us all.
CURMUDGEONLY AND PROUD OF ITBecoming an old curmudgeon, are you Mr. King? I can say as a retired road warrior, I’ve seen the same. A lot of inconsiderate behavior out there. I’ve never objected to the short phone conversation while dining alone. Loud incessant chattering while dining can be annoying. I remember being in a restroom while a man in a stall was having a conversation while making unmistakable loud noises while on the toilet.  Must have been his brains exiting his body.—Roger
I’m not trying to be a grandmother about this. All I’m trying to say is I find it wrong to be on the phone throughout dinner, and I find out more wrong to be on the phone in a public restroom. 
STILL CONFUSED ABOUT THE CATCH RULERegarding the new catch rule: On the sideline if a receiver reaches up and catches the ball on his tip-toes and then immediately goes out of bounds, where’s the “football move?” Think of the Santonio Holmes winning catch in the super bowl. So there will be a catch rule for catches in the field of play, but that doesn’t apply to the sidelines or end line? Two feet down and control, it’s a catch. Do away with the “football move” part. So the result could be an uptick in fumbles. Big deal. Just about every rule change has benefited offense. Throw defense a freaking bone for once.—Mario F.
When going to the ground out of bounds, as after establishing two feet inbounds, the catch will be legal as long as the player does not lose the ball before falling to the ground out of bounds. The “football move” part is in the rule because the simple act of catching the ball with two feet on the ground would add a fear of scores of monster hits on receivers, trying to force fumbles.
WHY DON’T WE JUST MAKE CATCHES NON-REVIEWABLE?You rightly point out that the biggest problem with the catch rule is the replay. Why don’t I hear anybody suggesting to make catches non-reviewable? Or how about this: We can review whether a foot was in bounds or out of bounds, but the judgment of possession is left to the call on the field.—Jared
I don’t like it. The game moves too fast to leave calls like that to chance. The first time there’s a crucial catch/non-catch that America sees was called wrong on the field and could have been easily fixed by replay and wasn’t, the outcry will be deafening.
DPI RULE IS OUTDATEDHere’s another reason you’re right that pass interference needs to be a 15-yard penalty (except for the obvious down-field muggings): history. The spot-foul began in the era when defensive players could rough up receivers right up to the moment the QB released the football. So, logically, it made perfect sense to impose a penalty “at the spot of the foul” because the foul itself reflected a defensive player’s crossing of the line from permissible to impermissible downfield contact. In that era, when defenses had the benefit of all-field bumping, offenses received the counterbenefit of the all-field spot foul. Well, it’s been 40 years (!) since the NFL allowed that kind of defense. Which makes a change in the P.I. rule long overdue.—Marc G.
The big argument against it is that defensive backs, once beaten, would simply mug the receivers. One: That rarely happens in college football; Stanford’s David Shaw told me so. Two: That’s why there was a clause in the rule that says egregious fouls could be spot fouls. Offensive players TRY to get the mega-yardage DPIs called all the time. It’s time the acting, and the field-tilting calls, get erased from the game.
ROBERT KRAFT’S SUPPORTI applaud Bob Kraft for his generosity of money and spirit to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School by donating his plane to the students and families to attend the Washington demonstration Saturday. But why is he not as forthright in his support of the NFL players protesting police brutality? Are they also not the few that might help change the world? I’d hate to think it’s because the players are black and the students are white.—John G., Cedar Grove, N.J.
I doubt that’s the reason. But it’s an interesting email and thought.
WAYNE HUIZENGA FROM A MARLINS VIEWYou write: “You won’t find many people—any, probably—with a bad word to say about Huizenga the sports owner.” I’m a big fan of the site and your writing, but this is just false. As a Dolphins owner, maybe. But Wayne Huizenga is vilified in South Florida for his role in dismantling the Florida Marlins after their 1997 World Series victory. He cut payroll dramatically and then sold the team for a huge markup the following year. (Sound familiar, Marlins fans?) I remember being a kid at Joe Robbie Stadium (or so it was called then) the night Dan Marino’s name was added to the stadium’s ring of honor. Huizenga was present and was booed so much, his wife was crying. It would have continued had Marino not asked the crowd to stop. But as long as Nick Saban likes him ...—Anonymous
Thanks for pointing that out. You’re right. I should have included the Marlins’ emotions after the stripping of the franchise.
ON ODELLIsn’t there a parallel to be drawn and/or lesson to be learned from the Steelers getting rid of: 1) Plaxico Burress and 2) Santonio Holmes?—Bill S.
Interesting. I don’t think either was the talent Beckham is, and I know neither wanted quarterback money, which Beckham does. The Giants have to decide whether they want to pay a superior player more than any previous receiver in history. I think it’s a painstaking decision for them.

              Jeff Van Gundy flustered Mike Breen with a question about second cousins during Rockets-Spurs.
            
            
1. I'm a huge fan of Jeff Van Gundy. I think he's the best NBA analyst on TV and a big part of that is because he will often venture off into bizarre territories. He's not quite Bill Walton, but he definitely has a little Walton in him.
This was proven once again on Sunday when, during the Rockets-Spurs game on ABC, Van Gundy started going off about second cousins. The rant even included a question that left play-by-play Mike Breen completely flustered.

Major League Baseball is back but the excitement of a new season hasn't caught on everywhere. 
The first Monday on the schedule came with some bleak attendance numbers in several stadiums, and the poor weather can't be blamed for all of it. 
The Miami Marlins were expected to struggle to put fans in the stands this summer following an offseason fire sale, and those projections seem to be accurate. Even with the Boston Red Sox in town, the Marlins managed just 11,113 fans for Monday's series opener. This comes after Miami managed just 68,035 total fans for a four-game weekend series with the Chicago Cubs, which included Opening Day.
After hosting the Los Angeles Angels, Mike Trout, and Shohei Ohtani for a four-game set, which drew an average of 21,000 fans, the Oakland Athletics managed just 7,416 for their series opener with the Texas Rangers.
Even the attendance juggernaut Toronto Blue Jays had a sparse crowd at the Rogers Centre for their clash with the rebuilding Chicago White Sox on Monday. Only 16,629 were in attendance to watch the 4-2 win - the smallest crowd in Toronto since May 27, 2015 (15,463). The Blue Jays, who led the American League in total attendance the past two seasons, did still average 37,000 fans for a four-game weekend set against the New York Yankees. 
""Mondays are Mondays - that's the best way for me to describe it,"" Blue Jays All-Star Josh Donaldson said about the crowd, according to Shi Davidi of Sportsnet. ""For me, everything that I've been around, we've had great support. I think maybe people were coming into this season not having high expectations for our team. If we continue to play well and continue to put a good product out there on the field, I know this city, and this city is going to get behind us.""

The Michael Jordan or LeBron James GOAT debate is raging again as the latter just passed the former’s record streak of double-digit scoring games and wraps up one of his best seasons at the age of 33. James averaged a triple-double in February – the first time he has done so in a month. He’s averaging career highs in rebounding and assists and his 27.4 points per game are his highest since 2009-10. 
What’s not debatable: LeBron is the better passer. In fact, it’s not even close. 
As you’ve probably heard, James passed 8,000 career assists in February, becoming the first player in NBA history with 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists. 
When describing LeBron’s career achievements and skills, the word “passing” should absolutely be one of the first terms used.
James’ career-high assist rate (9.1) is good for second-best in the NBA, trailing only Russell Westbrook’s 10.2 per game.
Furthermore, James is the only player in the league that ranks among the top-two in proficiency in two different types of passes. We’re not talking about no-look, behind-the-back or nutmeg dimes – though he’s mastered all of the above. We’re talking more fundamental passes: his assist rate ranks second on both weak side kick-outs and skip passes, surrounded as usual by point guards on the leaderboard.
Consider this: LeBron ranks 11th in career assists. The rest of the top 25 are all point guards. 
He has broken the mold for what a front-court player can be. Add this irrefutable argument near the top of the list the next time you get into a Jordan or James dispute this week.

It’s not all championships and greased poles for Philadelphia sports fans lately. The 76ers’ All-Star center Joel Embiid underwent surgery this past weekend to repair his fractured orbital bone and will remain sidelined at least two weeks. However, his team has kept rolling without him and has now won 10 in a row – the longest active winning streak in the NBA. 
Granted seven of those games and nine minutes of another were with Embiid on the court. Even so, losing a player of his magnitude changes a team’s approach and with the 76ers still in the hunt for the third seed in the East, it’s worthwhile to take a look at how they are adjusting. 
In short, everyone has had to step up.

 76ers lineups against Atlanta


The most obvious change is that Amir Johnson has had to step up at the center position in Embiid’s absence. He played a season-high 31 minutes in the 119-102 win over Charlotte on Sunday and pulled down 11 rebounds (second-highest total of the season) in the 101-91 win over Atlanta on Friday. He’s more of a defensive force than he is a factor on offense -- and a significant downgrade on both ends of the floor.

 76ers lineups against the Hawks



Obviously, it hasn’t hurt that the 76ers’ past two opponents have been the Hawks and Hornets – both of whom have been eliminated from the postseason. Indeed, Atlanta is actively vying for the top pick in this year’s Draft. Nonetheless, Philadelphia needs to take advantage of these winnable games. Up next is Brooklyn on Tuesday night; they were eliminated a while ago. The Sixers also get the Hawks again (a week from Tuesday) as one of their final five games plus Detroit (on the brink of elimination) and Dallas (already eliminated). 
The schedule has done them favors, but specifically how are the 76ers taking advantage? 
Making do without their star center has forced several new lineup combinations the past two games, but the 76ers have found a few that have worked particularly well. 
Ben Simmons and Robert Covington have been on the floor for a lot of Philly’s successful stretches the past few games. They will be the duo to watch for the 76ers the next two weeks. 
This is the group with whom the 76ers will be finishing off the regular season slate of games. The NBA playoffs get under way on April 14, and there is a chance Embiid could be cleared to play by then. The Philly fans certainly hope so, but they will get a good look at life without him the next few weeks just in case they need to roll into the first round of the postseason minus their superstar.

Anyone who has watched the NBA this season has seen numerous serious injuries to All-Star caliber players.
The league has lost perennial stars the likes of Kristaps Porzingis, DeMarcus Cousins and Gordon Hayward for the season, and it has seen Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving and Joel Embiid all miss significant portions of the year as well.
If it seems like there have been a lot of injuries this season — almost more than you could remember— that would be correct.
In fact, according to NBA injury analyst Jeff Stotts, the total number of games missed in the NBA this season has eclipsed the 5,000 mark. That is the most games players have missed in a season since 2005-06 when the league stopped using the injured reserve list.

Total NBA games lost to injury or illness crossed the 5,000 mark over the weekend. This is the first time since the league stopped using the injured reserve list prior to the 2005-06 season that this has occurred.

“I don’t expect that from anybody,"" Beilein said, adding that he thought Harbaugh probably watched the game on TV.
Beilen also said he and Harbaugh have texted frequently during Michigan’s run the NCAA tournament and he expected to hear from him again before the night was over.
“He’s been great,"" Beilein said.

Three weeks after Purdue won its first bowl game since 2011, Boilermakers fans were caught off guard by some news: Tony Levine, who is considered one of the top special teams coordinators in the nation and engineered four successful fake punts during his first year in West Lafayette, had resigned. Head coach Jeff Brohm’s statement was brief, only saying that Levine was pursing opportunities outside of coaching. The next day Levine took to Twitter to offer a longer explanation, expressing his desire to make his four kids—ages 12, 10, 8 and 6—more of a priority and move the family back to Houston, a city they’d fallen in love with when Levine served as the University of Houston’s head coach from 2011 to ’14.
Turns out, the 45-year-old Levine has embarked on an interesting second act. Levine, who has coached at every level from the NFL to third grade flag football over the past two decades, is now the owner/operator of a Chick-fil-A franchise that is set to open in about six weeks in the Houston suburb of Missouri City. It all seems like quite the adjustment for someone who doesn’t have much experience in the kitchen—aside from making some mac and cheese and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, his wife jokes.
“The reasons when I was 23 years old that I wanted to get into coaching, the things that I’ve been passionate about for most of my life—developing people, team-building, identifying and recruiting talent, competing—while I had a love for those, I saw an opportunity with Chick-fil-A to become an owner/operator where a lot of those same things that I was passionate about I could keep doing, and the ability to stay in Houston was very important to my wife and I and our family as a whole.”
The seeds of Levine’s career change were sown about three years ago, after he had been let go following a 21–17 run over three years as the Cougars’ head coach. He spent the next 14 months out of coaching.
“I noticed a change in him,” says Levine’s wife, Erin. “Maybe it was perspective. He got a chance to be around home more and be around the kids more.”
Levine says he loved being able to coach his two oldest boys’ flag football team, go to their daughter’s dance recitals, be involved in piano lessons and watch their basketball games. A friend who owns several Chick-fil-A franchises in the Houston area and had told Levine about the flexibility to be home when he needs to be.
Even though Levine returned to the sidelines in 2016 under his old buddy Jeff Brohm at Western Kentucky and then moved from there to Purdue along with Brohm last year, the idea of bringing his family back to Houston and a more stable lifestyle intrigued him.
Getting the opportunity to own a Chick-fil-A franchise, though, isn’t much easier than landing a five-star recruit. In 2016, the company had about 40,000 owner/operator applications, and less than 100 were selected, according to Carrie Kurlander, Chick-fil-A’s VP of External Communications.
“The selection process is rigorous,” she says. “We look for proven leaders with a heart for service, commitment to thoughtfully and strategically develop talent, while also having a desire to give back to their communities. Tony is all of the above. Our operator community is made up of professionals who come from an interesting and broad experience base. We have former Navy SEALs, Fortune 500 executives and even a winner from Shark Tank. Tony’s experience at the highest level of coaching makes him a compelling selection, and we are thrilled that he has chosen to spend the next chapter of his career in business with us.”
The new franchise is just two miles from the home the Levines lived in during his days as Cougars coach and never sold. Levine couldn’t wait to break the news to his kids. “They were so excited to be coming back,” Erin says. “They were getting to go right back to our home and their old neighborhood and their friends, and they wanted to be around Daddy.”
Levine told Brohm of his intentions a few weeks before Purdue’s appearance in the Foster Farms Bowl against Arizona.
“I know he loved coaching and you could tell it was tough,” Brohm says. “It’s a different path to go and it takes a lot of courage to do. But I think he’ll do great because he’s such a man of high integrity and it’s a great move for him and his family. I did tell him, ‘If you ever change your mind down the road, I’m a phone call away.”
The move back to Texas, though, wasn’t the only major change the family would have to deal with. In mid-December, Erin was diagnosed with breast cancer. Since then, she has had three months of chemo treatments, with one more session to go.
“I’m doing O.K.,” she says. “It’s kind of a roller coaster. I have good days and bad days, but I’m ready to get through it and come out on the other side.”
As scary as the diagnosis is, it helped knowing that her husband has more flexibility to help around the house with the kids and the family can rely on a support system it has built over the past decade.
“I saw that the Lord has worked this all out,” she says. “We don’t have family here but to have Tony be home more, it’s been such a relief for me. That’s allowed me to take a breath or take a nap when I need to.”
In the run-up to the grand opening, Levine has been meeting with Chick-fil-A brass and dealing with permits, utilities and all of the little behind-the-scenes details that need to get sorted out. Next up is staffing.
“We have to put together a team between 75 and 90 members to operate and run the restaurant,” he says. “I feel like that is going to be a lot like recruiting. I enjoyed identifying and recruiting talent, and I think absolutely there’s a lot of similarities in doing that. There’s a lot of meetings and decisions that have to be made.”
In a meeting with Chick-fil-A’s grand opening supervisors, Levine’s coaching pedigree was pretty apparent when he was asked about how he would ideally manage the organizational chart of his restaurant.
Levine’s response: “If I look at the kitchen director as the defensive coordinator and the front-of-the-restaurant director as the offensive coordinator, and I don’t have another director, than I see it like a football program that has an OC and a DC but they split up the special teams among the staff, and sometimes it doesn’t necessarily get the importance that it deserves. So I want a special teams coordinator from day one, and I want a drive-thru director from day one.”
The grand opening supervisor loved the analogy.
Levine expects to miss the game-planning and relationships of big-time coaching, but he thinks his new franchise can fill part of that void. “I already see some of the parallels with what I’ll be doing now with our team members and also in the decision-making, strategy and systems and processes within the restaurant,” he says.
In addition, he plans to help coach his sons’ flag football teams, and he also won’t have to look too far to get a taste of the competition of coaching. His old friend and neighbor David Bailiff, who was fired this winter after 11 seasons as the head coach at Rice, is a member of the ownership group for a new franchise of the NOLA Poboys sandwich chain that opened right down the street from him about two months ago.
“It is maybe two football fields from our Chick-fil-A,” Levine says. “Our competition will be very friendly.”

Former Astros first base coach Rich Dauer made an emotional return to Minute Maid Park on Monday to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
RELATED:  Astros unveil banner
Dauer, who spent three seasons with the franchise, nearly died last year as the result of a subdural hematoma. The 65-year-old slipped and fell on a wet floor the night before the Astros’ championship parade and rode in the parade unaware that he had bleeding on the brain.

ATLANTA (AP) -- Pitchers are having a hard time keeping Bryce Harper off the bases -- and inside the park. 
Harper's hot start is a big reason the Washington Nationals are unbeaten.
BOX SCORE:  NATIONALS 8, BRAVES 1
The star slugger hit a three-run homer and the quick-scoring Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves 8-1 on Monday night for the first 4-0 start to a season in their Washington history.
Harper's second-inning shot off Sean Newcomb (0-1) to center field gave the Nationals a 5-0 lead. He also drew four walks and scored three runs.
Harper has three homers -- including two in his last two at-bats during Sunday's 6-5 win at Cincinnati -- and seven RBIs. He reached in eight consecutive plate appearances, two shy of the Nationals record, before grounding out in the ninth.
Harper said he wasn't far off a chance to homer in four straight at-bats.
""I got a pitch I could absolutely drive and just topped it a little bit,"" he said.
First-year manager Dave Martinez wasn't about to complain.
""He's good. He's one of the best,"" Martinez said. ""I'm glad I get to watch him play every day and hopefully he continues doing what he's doing.""
Howie Kendrick's double to right field drove in Harper, who walked, in Washington's two-run first inning.
It marked the fourth straight game as the road team the Nationals scored in the first inning to give their starting pitcher a lead before his first pitch.
This time, the beneficiary was Tanner Roark (1-0), who allowed one run in seven innings. Backed by strong defense, including on third baseman Anthony Rendon's diving stop of Dansby Swanson's grounder in the seventh, Roark gave up four hits with one walk and six strikeouts.
The Nationals stretched the lead in the second.
After Newcomb gave up singles to Pedro Severino and Anthony Rendon, Harper walked to the plate as stadium organist Matthew Kaminski played the somber ""Imperial March."" Braves fans chimed in with boos.
Harper crushed a first-pitch fastball .
""I was trying to come in more,"" Newcomb said, adding the pitch instead ""was middle and low where he swings.""
The homer landed in the decorative rocks behind the 400-foot marker on the center-field wall.
Newcomb allowed six runs, five earned, on five hits and four walks in 4 1/3 innings.
Freddie Freeman's single drove in Ender Inciarte, who singled and stole second, in the fourth.
Nationals pinch-hitter Brian Goodwin had a two-run single off Jose Ramirez in the ninth.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Nationals: C Matt Wieters was placed on the 10-day DL with a mild left oblique strain to address what is believed to be a short-term injury ""rather than it becomes a big issue,"" according to Martinez. He plans to ""mix and match"" backups Miguel Montero and Severino, who was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse before the game. ... 2B Daniel Murphy, on the DL following right knee surgery, was cleared for the first time to run in the outfield before the game.
Braves: The addition of C Carlos Perez allows manager Brian Snitker to be cautious with C Kurt Suzuki, still recovering from a bruised right hand. With Tyler Flowers (left oblique strain) expected to miss a few weeks, Perez will play behind Chris Stewart, who made his second straight start. ... LHP Luiz Gohara (left ankle sprain) threw two innings in a simulated game and had no problems with the ankle, according to Snitker.
FAST STARTS
Before the franchise moved to Washington in 2005, the Montreal Expos started 5-0 in 1972 and 4-0 in 1983.
FIRST PITCH
MLS Atlanta United's Josef Martinez, wearing an Inciarte jersey, threw a strike to the Gold Glove outfielder for the ceremonial first pitch. Inciarte and Martinez are from Venezuela.
EARLY EXITS
Braves starting pitchers have failed to complete six innings in all four games and have a 5.66 ERA after allowing 13 earned runs in 20 2/3 innings.
PROMISING DEBUT
Braves right-hander Anibal Sanchez, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Gwinnett before the game, pitched three scoreless innings in relief to strengthen his bid for a spot in the rotation.
""I thought he was real good,"" Snitker said. ""He mixed pitches well, moved the ball around. He knows what he's doing.""
UP NEXT
Nationals: RHP A.J. Cole, who made his major league debut at Turner Field in a 13-12 win on April 28, 2015, will make his 2018 debut on Tuesday night.
Braves: RHP Julio Teheran was 3-1 with a 3.24 ERA in four starts against the Nationals in 2017. He allowed four runs in 5 2/3 innings against Philadelphia and did not receive a decision in his first start this season.

Cheerleaders for the Carolina Panthers, known as the TopCats, must arrive at the stadium on game days at least five hours before kickoff. Body piercings and tattoos must be removed or covered. Water breaks can be taken only when the Panthers are on offense. TopCats must leave the stadium to change into their personal attire.
Baltimore Ravens cheerleaders were subject to regular weigh-ins and are expected to “maintain ideal body weight,” according to a handbook from 2009. The Cincinnati Ben-Gals were even more precise in recent years: Cheerleaders had to be within three pounds of their “ideal weight.”
Some cheerleaders must pay hundreds of dollars for their uniforms, yet are paid little more than minimum wage. Cheerleaders must sell raffle tickets and calendars and appear at charity events and golf tournaments, yet they receive none of the proceeds. Cheerleader handbooks, seven of which have been reviewed by The New York Times, include personal hygiene tips, like shaving techniques and the proper use of tampons. In some cases, wearing sweatpants in public is forbidden.

The New Orleans Saints, who fired a cheerleader this year for posting a picture the team deemed inappropriate on her private Instagram account, are one of many National Football League teams with stringent, and seemingly anachronistic, rules for their cheerleaders.
Across the N.F.L., teams even try to place extensive controls on how cheerleaders conduct their lives outside work. This includes limiting their social media activity as well as the people they choose to date and socialize with. Restrictions are placed on their nail polish and jewelry.
Those rules and additional work requirements have fueled another public relations headache for the N.F.L., after The Times revealed last week that Bailey Davis, the cheerleader the Saints dismissed in January, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming unfair treatment. The complaint comes at time when the N.F.L. is dealing with issues of domestic violence and sexual harassment among players and league employees, and when issues of gender equality are facing unprecedented scrutiny in nearly every corner of the country.
The complaint is the first step in what could be a lengthy litigation with the Saints franchise and the league. Ms. Davis spent much of last week appearing on television, criticizing the Saints and other N.F.L. teams for having rules that she said demean women.
Leslie A. Lanusse, a lawyer representing the Saints, said the franchise strives to treat all employees fairly and denied that the franchise had discriminated against Ms. Davis because of her gender. “At the appropriate time and in the appropriate forum, the Saints will defend the organization’s policies and workplace rules,” Ms. Lanusse said in an email.

The N.F.L. declined to comment. The Ravens did not respond to questions about their current policies. The Bengals said they had updated their rules for cheerleaders and no longer have precise weight guidelines.
Unlike N.F.L. players, who are unionized and generally free to promote themselves in any way they choose, cheerleaders are part-time workers with few benefits. A few teams, including the Chicago Bears, the Giants and the Pittsburgh Steelers, do not employ cheerleaders. Most of the more than two dozen other teams with cheerleaders outline the rules and restrictions in the cheerleaders’ contracts and handbooks.
Other rules are applied as a specific reaction to an ever-changing social environment. Cheerleaders who complain about the conditions are told that they can easily be replaced. The threats are not empty. In this employee-employer relationship, the teams have all the leverage.
“The club’s intention is to completely control the behavior of the women, even when they are not actually at their workplace,” said Leslie Levy, who represented cheerleaders who sued the Jets and the Oakland Raiders. “It’s an issue of power. You see a disparate treatment between the cheerleaders, and the mascots and anyone else who works for the team. I can’t think of another arena where employers exert this level of control, even when they are not at work.”
Ms. Levy and other lawyers have had some success. In 2016 the Jets agreed to pay their cheerleaders, known as The Flight Crew, almost $325,000 in back pay. The Raiders agreed to $1.25 million in back pay for the Raiderettes. (The Raiders did not respond to questions about their cheerleading policies.)
Despite increases in pay, the rules persist in part because supply outweighs demand. Most teams employ only a few dozen cheerleaders, who must audition along with hundreds of other candidates every year to keep their jobs. In the case of the Saints, cheerleaders are limited to a maximum of four years with the club. Yet thousands of women are eager to join the squad.
To be sure, there are cheerleaders for whom the good experiences far outweigh the bad.
“Cheerleading changed my life,” said Flavia Berys, a former cheerleader for the San Diego Chargers who wrote books on audition secrets and became a real estate lawyer. “When I was an N.F.L. cheerleader, I learned a lot about how to speak to the media, I learned about the rules of decorum and professionalism. We were taught how to interact with the staff and the players, and everything. The training we had was all for a reason, and looking back, I think it was all for the right reasons.”
Nearly every N.F.L. team owner is a man, though some cheerleader programs are run by female executives. The league lets the teams establish their own rules for cheerleading squads.
Cheerleaders are seen as an integral part of the game-day experience, well-established entertainment that fans and television networks have come to expect at sports stadiums. For decades, many teams have subscribed to the philosophy that sex sells, so cheerleaders’ dress in skimpy outfits, wave pompoms and dance suggestively throughout football games, where the majority of fans are men.
But for all their upbeat energy on game days, cheerleaders toil under intense scrutiny, based on the rules included in the handbooks issued by nearly a dozen N.F.L. teams, as well as many of the unwritten rules of the job.
For several years, the cheerleaders for the Saints, the Saintsations, had to sell glossy calendars of themselves in bikinis. Before each home game, cheerleaders walked outside the stadium and tried to sell their allotment of 20 calendars to fans, many of whom had been drinking. If they failed to sell all 20, the cheerleaders had to wander the stands between quarters.
“You walk by a guy and you’re afraid you’re going to get touched,” said Ms. Davis, the former member of the Saintsations fired in January for the Instagram post. “Every girl dreads going out there before the games. We didn’t feel very important because we were literally thrown into the mix with the fans. Who would throw professional cheerleaders, walking around with cash, out with drunk fans?”
Before the Buffalo Bills’ cheerleaders, known as the Jills, were disbanded several years ago following a lawsuit, dancers were expected to sell 50 calendars a season. They had to buy them in advance, for $10, and sell them for $15. They were allowed to pocket the profit.
Like most teams, the Ravens prohibit cheerleaders from working for other teams, or from taking part in exotic dancing, posing nude or seminude, or “performing in tasteless films, photos or bikini/swimwear contest.”
The handbook given to the Oakland Raiderettes included a list of fines. Cheerleaders must pay $10 if they bring the wrong pompoms to practice, or their boots are not polished on game day. If they forgot all or part of their uniform on game day, they could be docked an entire day’s pay. The Raiderettes — known as Football’s Fabulous Females — are also coached on their body language and dining etiquette. (“Bread is to be broken with your hands” and “pass food to your right.”)
Even when they aren’t on duty for their teams, cheerleaders are subject to specific franchise rules about their behavior. They are forbidden from fraternizing with players. They cannot speak with them, seek their autographs or follow them on social media. They must block players who follow them. They are not allowed to post pictures of themselves in uniform. Teams say this rule is to prevent the cheerleaders from attracting stalkers.
According to their 2016 handbook, the San Francisco Gold Rush cheerleaders are told never to disclose that they are affiliated with the team. They are also advised to “turn off your GPS applications on your phone that will indicate where you are any given time.”
Some teams are adapting. The Los Angeles Rams recently announced that for the first time, two men will join their team of 40 dancers. (Men have worked as acrobats and baton twirlers on N.F.L. sidelines before.) Keely Fimbres, the head of cheerleading for the Rams for 28 years, said adding men to the team is a sign that gender roles are changing, however slowly.
“I think this is just the right timing because we talk about equality and inclusiveness,” she said. “They’ll be fun to watch on Sundays.”

If we’ve learned anything from this year’s wild and unpredictable NCAA Tournament — or, really, most any NCAA Tournament — it’s that the things we think we know don’t always play out as we expect. With that in mind, we offer Sporting News’ annual way-too-early top 25, a look at how next year’s rankings might look for the 2018-19 season. 
You know, for now. As always, the leading influence for this ranking comes from SN college hoops guru Mike DeCourcy, our resident Hall of Famer, with contributions from yours truly, college hoops editor Nick Birdsong and everything-college wonderkind Bill Bender. 
MORE: Meet Matt McClung, The Freak, The Legend
We’ll adjust these rankings over the summer, based on NBA Draft decisions, graduate transfers and whatever other news impacts how teams will look on the court for 2018-19.
(NOTE: All recruiting rankings from Scout.com.)
Head coach Porter Moser’s crew was not a one-year wonder. Yes, Loyola absolutely will miss seniors Donte Ingram, Ben Richardson and Aundre Jackson, but the core of stars the Ramblers have coming back has to scare other Missouri Valley teams, and anyone else who happens to be on their non-conference schedule.
Big man Cameron Krutwig was just a freshman this season; wait until he gets another offseason under his belt. Clayton Custer showed he wasn’t afraid of the big moments, and Marques Townes proved the same during their magical NCAA Tournament run. And they have the highest-ranked MVC recruiting class, checking in at No. 81 nationally on the Scout.com list.
The Irish bid a fond farewell to a couple of mainstays, seniors Bonzie Colson and Matt Farrell, but junior-to-be T.J. Gibbs is back after averaging 15.3 points per game and shooting 40.3 percent from 3-point range, and Rex Pflueger is back after averaging 8.0 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists per contest.
Mike Brey has an outstanding class coming in — it’s No. 10 in the nation — led by 4-star big man Nate Laszewski and a trio of 4-star shooting guards, Prentiss Hubb, Robby Carmody and Dane Goodwin. Expect Notre Dame back in the tournament next spring.
This particular spot in the top 25 is all about the uncertainty around Tony Carr’s NBA decision. Penn State closed the season strong — winning two games in the Big Ten Tournament before pushing Purdue to the wire — and then won five games and the NIT championship in impressive fashion, only one win coming by single digits.
If Carr, who averaged 21.3 points in the final four games, comes back for his junior season, Penn State probably deserves to be higher. If he jumps to the NBA, maybe this is an “also receiving votes” type of squad. Either way, the Nittany Lions are a good bet to get back into the NCAA Tournament next season. Even without Carr, they’d return three double-digit scorers: Lamar Stevens (15.5 points per game), Mike Watkins (12.1) and Josh Reaves (10.6).
This is as tumultuous an offseason as Xavier’s seen in quite a while, with longtime head coach Chris Mack taking the Louisville job. But the Xavier powers-that-be made the transition as smooth as possible, giving the head job to Travis Steele, the longtime assistant coach under Mack.
The Musketeers lose considerable senior talent — Trevon Bluiett, J.P. Macura, Kerem Kanter and Sean O’Mara — but they bring back a very talented group, too. Guys like Quentin Goodin, Paul Scruggs, Tyrique Jones and Naji Marshall are ready to take on bigger roles with more minutes available.
Ben Howland’s team won 25 games this year without an impact senior, and the Bulldogs have the No. 9 recruiting class coming in for next season. If everyone comes back, this will be one of the SEC’s best squads.
Brothers Quinndary and Nick Weatherspoon combined to average 24 points per game, and big man Aric Holman averaged 10.9 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.8 blocks. The incoming class includes one 5-star big man (Reggie Perry) and a couple of 4-star recruits (Robert Woodard and D.J. Stewart).
The truth is, it’s hard to know exactly how the loss of a do-everything guy like senior point guard Chris Chiozza will impact a team. But he’s gone, as is Egor Koulechov, and Jalen Hudson is testing the draft waters without an agent.
Even if Hudson leaves and the Gators lose their top three scorers, there is plenty of talent in Gainesville. KeVaughn Allen and Keith Stone are back, and Mike White has the No. 17 class on the way, led by 5-star point guard Andrew Nembhard.
Yep, the Badgers missed the NCAA Tournament this year, but it's not like they start next season with an 0-5 record or anything as a punishment. Fresh slate. Remember, they played better down the stretch — 5-3, with a couple of close losses to Michigan State — and none of their top 10 scorers this season were seniors. With the addition of talent (No. 59 recruiting class) coming in, expect the Badgers back in the dance.
The wild card, of course, is Ethan Happ. If Happ, who averaged 17.9 points and 8.0 rebounds per game, makes the decision to turn pro (he declared for the draft but didn’t sign with an agent), that changes things. This ranking is assuming he returns to Madison.
Yes, Moe Wagner is almost certainly gone, and Charles Matthews has played like a guy NBA teams would love to draft. If they return, Michigan hits top-five status.
But assuming they’re gone, Zavier Simpson is an outstanding point guard, and youngsters Jordan Poole and Isaiah Livers will be ready for bigger roles as sophomores. Coach John Beilein has a solid recruiting class coming in — four 4-star kids — and you know what he does with that kind of talent.
The Ducks missed the NCAA Tournament this year, but they return three of their top five scorers — Payton Pritchard (14.5 points per game), Troy Brown (11.3) and Paul White (9.4) — and have a stacked recruiting class coming in. And that’s why they’re inside the top 10.
Oregon’s class is ranked No. 2 nationally by Scout.com, led by 5-star big man Bol Bol (Manute’s son) and 5-star wing Louis King. Add in 4-star shooting guard Will Richardson and 4-star big man Miles Norris, and the Ducks could be the Pac-12’s best team.
Because we’ve learned never to doubt Mark Few’s ability to construct a dynamic roster, mostly. That, and the expected return of dynamic players Zach Norvell (12.7 points per game), Josh Perkins (12.3), Killian Tillie (12.9) and Rui Hachimura (11.6), though Hachimura could test the pro waters.
Brandon Clarke, a transfer who averaged 17.3 points for San Jose State as a sophomore, will be eligible after sitting out this season, and he’ll be ready to make a big impact.
Why they’re here: If Brunson, Bridges and Spellman all return, Villanova is No. 1. Easily. But Brunson, the National Player of the Year (by SN and many others), and Bridges could finish off their second national title on Monday night, and it’s fair to wonder whether they’d put off the NBA for a shot at a third. And Spellman certainly is playing like a frontcourt freshman who looks ready for the NBA; he’s been outstanding in the NCAA Tournament.
Even if all three jump, the Wildcats still will be a legit national title contender next season. Jay Wright has an outstanding recruiting class on the way, with 5-star point guard Jahvon Quinerly leading the No. 12 group.
Why they’re here: Depending on how draft decisions play out, Kentucky could actually have a plethora of “veterans” next season, a legitimately experienced team. Kentucky fans are holding out hope that Knox, SGA and Diallo could return, and while that is possible — all three loved the Kentucky experience — they’re likely to jump to the NBA and serious cash.
Vanderbilt and Washington could turn pro, too, but especially Vanderbilt could improve his stock with a sophomore year after injuries cut short his freshman year (only 14 games). The recruiting class is “only” ranked No. 6 right now, but includes a couple of 5-star kids (Keldon Johnson and Immanuel Quickly) and one 4-star recruit (Tyler Herro).
Why they’re here: Grayson Allen was the only impact senior on this year's team, but the other four starters — Marvin Bagley, Wendell Carter, Gary Trent, Jr. and Trevon Duval — are all likely first-round picks. The Blue Devils have four of the top 10 recruits in the country coming to Durham, including the top three. It’s just an incredible class.
Wings R.J. Barrett and Cameron Reddish are the top two recruits, nationally, and Zion Williamson — you’ve seen his dunking exploits — is No. 3. And Tre Jones might “only” be the No. 9 recruit nationally, but he’s the No. 1 overall point guard. There might be a few bumps in the road, as is often the case with young teams, but the Blue Devils will have few peers, talent-wise.
Why they’re here: For next year’s Jayhawks, it’s all about the newbies. They’re adding two five-star guards, Quentin Grimes and Devon Dodson, and four-star big man David McCormack. The thing KU fans probably are most excited for, though, are the transfers. The Jayhawks have three established college players ready to hit the ground running after a year of pushing the starters on the scout team.
Point guard Charlie Moore averaged 12.2 points and 3.5 assists as a freshman at Cal. Brothers Dedric and K.J. Lawson starred at Memphis, though their experiences with the hometown team were certainly tumultuous at times. Dedric, a 6-9 forward, averaged 19.2 points, 9.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.1 blocks for Memphis in 2016-17; K.J. checks in at 6-8 and averaged 12.3 points, 8.1 rebounds and 2.8 assists.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — When you're a seven-time NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series champion, an 83-race winner and perpetually on the verge of hoisting that unprecedented eighth championship trophy, people are watching, dissecting and diagnosing your every move.
Jimmie Johnson is experiencing that right now, especially in the midst of a 29-race winless streak. Such a mark would seem luxurious and enviable to the vast majority of his competition, but it's the longest drought of his first-ballot Hall of Fame career, and Johnson could not be more ready to talk about something else.
Like a win at Texas Motor Speedway in the O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 this weekend, or maybe a victory next week at Bristol Motor Speedway. That would do it.
NASCAR: Full Cup Series schedule
Johnson is the defending winner of both races. That gives his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet team a source of optimism in hitching horsepower to opportunity at these tracks.
And at Texas, Johnson isn't just good. He's the best.
With a record seven Cup wins, 15 top-five and 21 top-10 finishes in 29 starts on the mile-and-a-half Fort Worth high banks, Johnson has the ability to change the conversation around him. He's the all-time leader in laps led (1,041) and has a rare top-10 career average in both finish (8.8) and starting position (9.4).
In recognition of Johnson's outstanding resume at the track and the fact that he is the defending winner, Texas Motor Speedway is giving away Jimmie Johnson bobble head dolls to 30,000 among the anticipated sold-out crowd. That's an additional 30,000 ""nods"" of support for a driver and team working its way out of a rut.
And should it take another week for Johnson and his team to rally, they would look to Bristol, which proved to be a motivating cause in 2017 for the opposite reasons.
Bristol is one of the rare venues at which Johnson has not dominated. His win in the spring race last year was only his second at the famous half-mile bullring; his first since the spring of 2010, the year he won an unprecedented fifth consecutive Cup title. He has finished 11th or better in six of the last seven Bristol races, and he has a pair of runner-up finishes in the spring 500-lapper, the latest in 2015.
MORE: Johnson, Hendrick begin search for new sponsor as Lowe's leaves
Johnson is ranked 17th in the current Cup standings, continuing a steady climb since a wreck early in the Daytona 500 put him in a points deficit to start the season. Although he has not yet led a lap this season, he has four top-15 finishes in the last four races, with a season-best ninth at California's Auto Club Speedway.
The absence from victory lane is not lost on Johnson, who has celebrated there more than any other driver he's competing with this season. Last week, he offered up a relevant quote from Babe Ruth via social media.
""It's hard to beat a person who never gives up,"" Johnson wrote, crediting the baseball great.
Added Johnson: ""I couldn't agree more and can't wait to get back to the track.""
That's one of the reasons he and his team know how to win. From the earliest days of Johnson trying to make a name for himself on NASCAR's biggest stage, perseverance has always been a part of his mindset.",sports

AUGUSTA, Ga. - Somewhere, Hal Sutton must be smiling.
Fred Couples revealed after a Monday Masters practice round with Tiger Woods that he would be playing again with the 42-year-old on Tuesday.
OK, that's not too surprising, especially with Couples calling Woods one of his best friends. But consider the full group set for Tuesday's practice round: Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, Thomas Pieters … and Phil Mickelson.
Tiger and Phil playing together on a Tuesday at Augusta National? It's true!
""I think Thomas and I will just hang out and watch,"" Couples quipped.
In fact, their Tuesday practice round is already underway (the group went off No. 10 tee). So yes, we've truly seen everything.
Woods and Mickelson have insisted recently that they've been friends for years and that the perceived past tension between them was overblown.
Those rumors of discord were certainly not dampened, though, when Sutton paired them together at the 2004 Ryder Cup, a disastrous experiment that ended in the star duo going 0-2 and looking miserable while doing it.
But it's 2018 now, and this is happening. What a time to be alive.

Through the remainder of the regular season, we'll take a look at how the night's action impacts the playoff races, highlighting which teams' postseason odds went up or down significantly.




The Florida Panthers won't go down without a fight.
The Panthers, who defeated the Carolina Hurricanes on Monday, continue to claw away at a wild-card position. Still, it's a tough road ahead, as Florida sits five points back of the New Jersey Devils with just four games remaining.




It's likely safe to start printing playoff tickets in Los Angeles.
A critical win over the Colorado Avalanche - also fighting for one of three unclaimed postseason positions in the West - boosted the Kings' playoff hopes to a near certainty, as the team looks poised to make the dance for just the second time in the past four years.

In a letter to fans on Monday afternoon, Vancouver Canucks icons Henrik and Daniel Sedin announced that they will retire after 18 years in the NHL at the end of the season.

We started the year with the mindset that a decision would be made in the postseason. But it became clear, after discussions with our families throughout the year, that this will be our last season. This feels right for all of us.
Being part of the Canucks family for 18 seasons has been the best period of our lives. But it's time to focus on our families and life after hockey. It's time to help with homework every night. It's time to be at every birthday party and to stand in the cold at every hockey rink, soccer game and riding lesson on weekends. It's time to be at home for dinner every night.

The twins have spent their entire careers in Vancouver, and were drafted second and third in the 1999 draft.  The duo also spent much of their time playing on the same line. Their names have been linked throughout their NHL career, and it's only fitting that they retire together. With only one week left in the regular NHL season the news took the hockey community by surprise. Fans and players took to social media to congratulate the duo on their remarkable NHL career.

Thanks guys for showing me around when a lost little boy from Sweden came to Vancouver. Congrats to amazing careers you are still the best players I've ever played with. Both on and off the ice.     pic.twitter.com/sfc2y3LoLt

Any young player coming into the league should be given a tape of the Sedins. They'd learn how to be a professional hockey player from it. Sedins not only survived what can be a harsh market (especially early in their career) but excelled in it. Professionalism personified.

They also blessed us with one of the best NHL gifs we've ever seen.

This day and age, we may never see any two players (twins or otherwise) remain teammates for 18 straight years. Kudos to a wonderful career, Sedins.     pic.twitter.com/zwajUVPOJa

 San Jose's Joonas Donskoi celebrates a goal against Vegas on Saturday.


Now that they're headed back to the postseason, the San Jose Sharks will spend the final week of the season looking to complete a task that was discussed in training camp.
San Jose opens its last homestand of 2017-18 on Tuesday night against the Dallas Stars, who have their eyes on playing spoiler down the stretch.
The Sharks secured their 12th playoff appearance in 13 seasons when the Los Angeles Kings defeated the Colorado Avalanche 3-1 on Monday. The win also clinched a spot for the Minnesota Wild.
San Jose (44-25-10) looks to avoid losing its fourth in a row after reeling off a season-high eight straight wins.
""The good news is we've set ourselves up to finish this season off with three home games and an opportunity to clinch home-ice advantage, which is something that's been a goal of ours from Day One,"" coach Peter DeBoer said after San Jose's 3-2 loss to Vegas on Saturday night. ""So, we'll sweep this one under the rug and get ready for the next one.""
Following this game, the Sharks meet Colorado on Thursday before closing the season Saturday against Minnesota. San Jose is in second place in the Pacific Division with narrow leads over the Kings and Anaheim Ducks.
First, the Sharks will focus on the Stars, who handed San Jose a 6-0 defeat behind 26 saves from Ben Bishop on New Year's Eve in Texas. Six weeks later, DeBoer's club evened the season series with a 5-2 win on home ice as Mikkel Boedker scored twice.
San Jose is 10-2-1 in its last 13 at home versus the Stars.
The Sharks may be without forward Evander Kane, who missed practice Monday with an undisclosed injury and will be a game-time decision, according to the San Jose Mercury News.
Since coming over from the Buffalo Sabres on Feb. 26, Kane has given the Sharks a boost with nine goals and five assists in 16 games. Only Joe Pavelski has more points since the trade with 17 (six goals, 11 assists).
Pavelski is tied with Brent Burns for the team lead with 63 points, and San Jose's captain has three goals and three assists in a three-game points streak at home versus Dallas.
Martin Jones needs one win to reach 30 for the third straight season since joining the Sharks in 2015. He's 2-1-0 with a 2.66 goals-against average in three career home games versus Dallas while with San Jose. Backup Aaron Dell's only career win over the Stars came in a 29-save effort on March 12, 2017 at SAP Center.
Dallas (40-31-8), which defeated the Wild 4-1 on Saturday, was eliminated from playoff contention when the Ducks rallied with the final three goals in a 4-3 overtime victory against the Avalanche on Sunday.
""The time for reflecting is you got all summer to do that -- and it's not now,"" Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Monday.
Dallas' fate was sealed with 0-6-2 slide in March, when the club lost 12 of 16 (4-8-4). The Stars have missed the playoffs in eight of the last 10 seasons.
Dallas winds down its season with a three-game trip through California with the chance to play spoiler.
""This is three playoff teams that need points, so we're going to get a really good test and it starts in San Jose,"" Hitchcock said. ""We haven't had a lot of luck there lately and we want to change that.""
Kari Lehtonen, who's been pressed into service with Bishop (lower body) out for the season, is 0-6-1 with a 3.40 GAA in his last seven road games. He's also 0-2-2 with a 2.64 GAA in his last five games (four starts) in Northern California.
On Saturday, Tyler Seguin became the third player in Dallas history with 40 goals, joining Jamie Benn (41 in 2015-16) and Mike Modano (50 in 1993-94). Seguin has a goal and four assists in his last three games overall, and a goal with four helpers in seven career games in San Jose.",sports

Tiger Woods, you have been sorely missed.
It's telling that since Tiger's personal life, body and game all went into the rough, the rise of golf's ""young stars"" have not come close to making the sport relevant like he can. Not a Rory. Not a Justin. Not a Dustin.
Phil Mickelson actually enjoyed a wonderful, winning career. And he's not Tiger.
God knows we media scum have tried to find, and or create, Tiger's equal.
Tiger last won a major in 2008, and after such a long stretch away, the 42-year-old is at last playing competitive golf, and in doing so is here to save the game.
While it will always be fun to follow Woods, don't plan on him doing anything for the sport other than playing it. Since '08, we should know we can't count on Tiger to do anything other than take care of Tiger.
Never has there been a greater gift to his sport who has let it down any more than Woods. Because, in the end, his priority is Tiger and nothing else.
It's his right, but what a waste. Tiger should be celebrated as the greatest golfer since Jack Nicklaus, and lamented for what could have been a significance on something far greater than 18 holes.
With 14 major championships, Tiger should have easily caught and broken Jack's record of 18. Tiger should have put this record so far out of reach that it would rank with Cy Young's 511 career wins, Wayne Gretzky's 215 points in a single season, or Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game.
With more celebrity than any golfer ever, and recognized on an international level the way few ever are, Tiger had tremendous power to do ... pretty much anything he wanted.
Tiger had no problem standing on the shoulders of so many who came before him, and chose to shrug his own in return.
Tiger had the opportunity to empower, to speak out, to educate. He created his own foundation and charity, which he deserves credit, but there was so much more to be had. So many more lives to affect.
We are talking about the first athlete, per Forbes, to be worth more than $1 billion.
Instead of being Muhammad Ali, Tiger is O.J. Simpson and Michael Jordan - just another high profile athlete who fell in love with, and now demands, all of the benefits of fame without any of her considerable hassles, specifically dealing with the masses underneath them.
In September of 1997, comedian Chris Rock aired a piece on his HBO show exploring Tiger's impact in the African American community. Having joined the PGA Tour the previous year, Woods was quite the story and prodigy.
Dressed as Woods, Rock drove a golf cart with a set of clubs into Harlem to see the Tiger impact.
Because Rock is a smart comedian, he was going for the joke, because that is Woods' impact on the African American community. Rock knew it then, and we've seen it now.
Tiger's greatest impact has been on Tiger. Good and bad.
We should have known back in '09, when his marriage went to the toilet, this is how this was going to go down. When his personal life went to hell, by his own making, one of the first items on his chore list was to shoot a commercial for Nike.
On the course, Tiger had always behaved like a petulant, four-letter-word-spewing brat. When a guy is as good as Tiger, we'll deal with it, and classify such behaviors as ""competitive.""
However as the remainder of Tiger's career plays out, age says he's on the final round of being competitive at the highest level.
Like you, I'll be watching.
Golf is better with Tiger playing in the final group on Sunday, and for the sake of our collective interest, hopefully he will tame Amen Corner and be in it until the final hole at Augusta.
Tiger Woods has been a fascinating, and captivating, career to follow, even if he could have done so much more.

Editor's Note: This story appeared in the March 2018 print issue of Golfweek
When Augusta Country Club sold more property to the neighboring Augusta National Golf Club, logic assumed this was another piece of the course-modernizing puzzle carried out since 1998. The home of the Masters had previously extended the 13th hole up against their neighboring property and recently filed plans for a change to its western flank, where a long-expected extension to the fifth hole could someday end up on Old Berckmans Road. However, expecting that the prized No. 13 will be lengthened in the coming year discounts how sensitive the current club leadership is to not altering the brilliance of golf's most dynamic risk-reward par 5.
Members and longtime Masters observers queried by Golfweek - most requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the subject - believe the interest in acquiring Augusta Country Club land started when Tiger Woods was on the 12th green during an early-century Masters and a bright-colored ball came sailing over the trees. Couple that peculiar moment with Augusta National's expansion of their campus on all sides, and the move seems consistent with past acquisitions. Most believe there is a strong desire to create a service road surrounding the property to make for a safer, quieter golf course during tournament week, with an option to someday build cabins near Rae's Creek. And there is the continued theme of pouring Masters profits into overall enhancement of the event and club.
Still, there has been the recent spectacle of Bubba Watson robbing the masterful risk-reward hole of its dignity by teeing off over the trees, leaving short irons into the green. And last year there was the sight of noted-draw-artist Sergio Garcia hitting a high cut over the pines to shorten the hole in his 2017 win. The challenge facing new Masters chairman Fred Ridley: maintain the balance of the tempting par 5 in the face of increasingly longer tee shots. The task is made slightly less difficult by the club's 2002 lengthening of the hole from 485 yards to 510 yards. That move caused concern among purists and ended up preserving the tempting qualities as driving distances and launch angles changed rapidly. There is also a clear description by club founder Bobby Jones that Ridley is said to hold as his guiding principle in studying what to do.
""The player is first tempted to dare the creek on his tee shot by playing close to the corner, because if he attains this position he has not only shortened the hole but obtained a more level lie for his second shot,"" Jones wrote in ""Golf Is My Game"" in 1960. ""Driving out to the right not only increases the length of the second, but encounters an annoying sidehill lie. The second shot as well entails a momentous decision whether or not to try for the green. A player who dares the creek on either his first or second shot may very easily encounter a six or seven on this hole. Yet reward of successful, bold play is most enticing.""
Dating to the club's opening in early 1933, the 13th hole remains remarkably similar to what Jones and Alister MacKenzie initially sketched out in multiple renderings. Bunkers behind the green were changed in 1954, the swale behind the putting surface deepened at Jack Nicklaus' urging in 1988 and, in 2002, the 13th was lengthened. One controversial 1995 change was later remedied: the tributary to Rae's Creek was altered to free up more water, eliminating the possibility of balls ending up on sand bars for the occasional bold recovery shot. That change was undone after much hand-wringing from former champions.
But such a slight alteration speaks to how quickly a small change can shift the dynamics of a hole asking players to take chances. It's something Ridley is well aware of as an elite amateur golfer who has spent a decade running the competition committees.
For 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott, the severe dogleg-left par 5 still poses many of the challenges outlined by Jones, with a few exceptions.
""If you can draw it off the tee, then it's quite a short hole now,"" he said. ""But it feels like the trees are encroaching more or they've grown a bit, so I don't find it that easy to get it around the corner. And then you don't want to run through the rough. So I think it's quite a tricky tee shot at the moment, because if you hit driver it's enough to go through the fairway, so you have to hit a draw, but obviously you don't want to hit it left (in the creek).""
Scott notes one risk-reward scenario that could lead to a tee extension.
""It's gotten to where you can tee up the driver and smack it as high as you can and go over the trees,"" he said. ""Some long guys can really bite it off, and when I mis-hit that shot and flare it out to the right, it's still manageable.""
After rattling off some key moments on the hole when players used a long iron or wood to go for the green, Scott said the landing area's steep pitch remains an equalizer.
""If you leave it on that severe upslope and have 3- or 4-iron, it's a really tricky golf shot, and perhaps if they were to lengthen it, that's the shot they'd like to face instead of a 7- or 8-iron.""
But change?
""I don't want them messing with the course too much any more,"" Scott said.
For now, he will get his wish.

The first leg of the NASCAR Cup season is in the rear-view mirror for teams as the sport finishes its first off break of the season.
The Cup Series won’t have another weekend off until June.
NASCAR America’s Steve Letarte explained why the next seven races are the most pivotal for teams before the playoffs.
Five of the seven tracks the series will visit – Texas, Richmond, Talladega, Dover and Kansas – are in the playoffs.
“When you go to five of the next seven races in the playoffs, you have to somehow find more speed out of your race cars and build those notebooks for later in the year,” Letarte said. “This next stretch (is) vitally important.”
Charlotte will be in the playoffs, but it will be raced on in its road course configuration.
After Parker Kligerman discussed what his mindset as a driver would be race-to-race, Letarte talked about the difference in driver and crew chief responsibilities.
“A driver needs to focus on one, a crew chief has 80 or 90 employees,” Letarte said. “With it taking five, six, seven weeks to turn a race car around, that means you have to be working four, five, six weeks ahead. I wish it was only about one race at a time. But it’s not that simple. It turns into one race at a time Friday morning when the garage opens.”

But afterward, it was all sadness as Beilein had to provide a more grounded speech to his team following a season-ending loss.

Villanova guard Donte DiVincenzo, the Wildcats' sixth man and upstart scorer off the bench, was more than an X factor in the national championship game. DiVincenzo was the hero for Nova — and the title game's most outstanding player, finishing with 31 points off 10-for-15 shooting to lead his team to a 79-62 win. What was so epic about his breakout performance? Villanova has a national player of the year (Jalen Brunson) and a future NBA draft pick (Mikal Bridges), but it was DiVincenzo who put on a clinic with three-pointers, no-look passes and athletic blocks.

 2018 NCAA Tournament

SAN ANTONIO  — The somber mood in Michigan's locker room after the NCAA Tournament championship game had no outward effect on John Beilein. When the smiling 65-year-old coach stepped into the Alamodome hallway, he looked nothing like a man who had just missed a golden opportunity to reach his only remaining professional goal.
RELATED: Men’s NCAA Tournament bracket
That's because Beilein doesn't see a national title as a goal at all, even after falling one game short for the second time in six seasons.
To Beilein, a championship is just one possible result from the never-ending process of coaching — and he loves the process, not the trophies.
""Oh man — don't worry about me,"" Beilein said. ""I would love to win a national championship for those guys, and for the University of Michigan, all those great students and all our alumni. But for me, this is why I coach: To be in that locker room right now with these kids and to have this opportunity to tell them, 'This is life.'
""This is a great part of life,"" he added. ""You have these highlights, and then all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, your season is over, and there's sadness. But in the long run, there's a lot of joy in what we just went through.""
The joy will return once the Wolverines get over a 79-62 defeat in which they simply couldn't keep up with Villanova. Donte DiVincenzo and his Wildcats completed one of the most impressive runs in tournament history with a comfortable victory over the Wolverines, who had won 14 straight games.
""Even if we had played our best, it would have been very difficult to win that game with what DiVincenzo did,"" Beilein said. ""It was an incredible performance. Sometimes those individual performances just beat you, and you just say, 'OK. We played you the best we could, and tonight, you were better than us.'""
Michigan had about 15 good minutes to start, largely thanks to Beilein's game plan to limit the Wildcats' 3-point shooting prowess while taking advantage of 6-foot-11 Moe Wagner's defensive mismatches.
But DiVincenzo and coach Jay Wright's Wildcats adjusted and ran away, turning the final minutes into a dismal exercise for the frustrated Wolverines. Beilein kept coaching until the end, prizing each minute and every chance to teach.
""John Beilein is one of the greatest coaches of all time,"" Wright said. ""We weren't prepared early for some of the things they were doing. They jumped on us, and I should have known better with John.""
A win over Villanova would have been the 800th of Beilein's collegiate coaching career, which began with the 1978-79 Erie Community College Kats. He has never served as an assistant coach, instead climbing deliberately from Newfane High School to seven collegiate stops — and taking four of those schools to the NCAA Tournament.
""We love Coach, and we really wanted to win this for him to get that first championship,"" said teary-eyed freshman Jordan Poole, who expects to be back to try again next season. ""That's one of the hardest parts about this, because we know what it would mean to the fans and everybody at Michigan, but especially for him.""
Michigan's fans know this feeling well: The Wolverines are 1-6 in NCAA title games, winning only in 1989 with Glen Rice and interim coach Steve Fisher.
But Beilein doesn't sound ready to stop trying. When he returns for his 12th season at Michigan in the fall, he'll tie Johnny Orr for the longest coaching tenure in Ann Arbor.
After six weeks of highs and one dizzying low, Beilein didn't sound particularly interested in sliding into the offseason at all. When asked about his upcoming plans, he lamented the fact he won't be able to coach his next team until July, thanks to the confluence of Michigan's long season and early exam period.
But he plans to spend the next few months getting reacquainted with his family, particularly the grandchildren. He also plans to slip down to St. Louis to drink some Budweiser while watching his beloved Cardinals — who won 8-4 earlier in the day, he already knew.
He'll also never stop preparing for his next chance to go after the one trophy he doesn't have — and doesn't really need.
""I think on Tuesday or Wednesday, I might not go into the office one of those days,"" Beilein said. ""I'm sure that Thursday or Friday, I'll be out recruiting.""

SAN ANTONIO — Juggernauts are not supposed to look like this, without a superstar, a catchy nickname, a lineup of future N.B.A. All-Stars or the air of intimidation that is palpable even in layup lines. Villanova has none of these things.
History, though, will look back at these Wildcats and their tactical, almost apologetic dominance throughout their six games in this N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament as a team that was, perhaps, just one or two steps ahead of the rest of the 350 laggards in Division I, a field that was forced to watch — mouths agape — revolutionary basketball unfold before them.
Villanova did not need to hit 18 3-pointers against Michigan in the national title game on Monday, as it did in dismantling Kansas in its semifinal. But the Wildcats found a multitude of other ways to outflank and outfinesse another opponent, this time on college basketball’s biggest stage, in a 79-62 win over the Wolverines before a crowd of 67,831 at the Alamodome.
It was the Wildcats’ second national championship in three years, and while it was a younger team than the one that beat North Carolina with a buzzer-beater in 2016, it is unquestionably better. Only three other teams since 1985 have won each of their games in the N.C.A.A. tournament by double-digits, as Villanova did.

“This,” Villanova Coach Jay Wright said of winning a second title, “is out of my comprehension.”

Michigan did have answers for five of Villanova’s top players, but not its sixth: Donte DiVincenzo, who came off the bench and scored 31 points. He fueled a comeback in the first half and put on a show in the second, scoring 11 straight points midway through the half to build Villanova’s lead to 16.
Michigan Coach John Beilein sat on his stool with a puzzled look. If it wasn’t DiVincenzo, it seemed, it would have been someone else. With Villanova, there was always somebody.
“Honestly, we never know,” Villanova forward Eric Paschall said. “We have so many talented dudes that can just get going. We don’t know who’s going to have a good night. Tonight, it was Donte.”
The blowout capped a season that began, unofficially, in the early morning of Sept. 26, the day federal officials publicly disclosed a covert investigation into widespread corruption in the shadowy swale of college basketball recruiting, further puncturing the sport’s claim to sanctity. Ten men had been arrested, including four Division I assistants, and within days, Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame coach at Louisville, was out of a job. The news lingered over the rest of the season.
There will be more on that. But the N.C.A.A. got something of a pass at the Final Four this time, when the tournament’s most prominent figure became Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, and the games more subtly revealed a different tectonic shift in the sport.
Beilein and his Villanova counterpart, Jay Wright, might not have imagined the way that offense would evolve when they first crossed paths, in tiny high school gyms in upstate New York in 1984 — Wright as a first-time assistant at the University of Rochester, Beilein a 41-year-old journeyman coach at Division II LeMoyne College. But they reached this pinnacle by largely ignoring the blue-chip prospects eager to rush through to the N.B.A. Instead, they brought the N.B.A. style to college.
Wright, in particular, loaded his lineup with talented shooters of all sizes, reminding scouts of a successful franchise at the next level: the Golden State Warriors. His team set an N.C.A.A. record for 3-pointers this season, and the Wildcats’ 18 baskets from beyond the arc in their win Saturday over Kansas were by far the most in a Final Four game.

“They present problems that most college teams can never present,” the ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla said. “The go-to guy on this team is the open man.”
Beilein’s system was always inventive during his previous coaching job at West Virginia — remember Kevin Pittsnogle? — but he acknowledged that he had evolved, too. He built his Michigan offense around an even more versatile big man: Moritz Wagner, who, at 6 feet 11 inches, was reminiscent of the Dallas Mavericks’ Dirk Nowitzki.
Wagner scored 9 of Michigan’s first 11 points on Monday, as the Wolverines found easy buckets in the early minutes. On the other end, Michigan’s length and defensive pressure clogged the passing lanes where Villanova thrives to generate open shots. Everything was contested. The Wildcats missed eight of their first nine 3-pointers.
In the Villanova huddle, the players calmly said, “attitude” — a mantra of this program, meant to help maintain composure. And then, a surprising spark caught fire off the bench.
It fit the pregame prayer delivered by the team’s chaplain, Father Rob Hagan, and his message from Saint Paul about sharing strength. It hardly surprised any of DiVincenzo’s teammates, though, when he provided the offensive jolt.
“If you keep finding him, he’s going to keep knocking down shots,” the freshman guard Collin Gillespie said. “Early on, I kind of knew.”
DiVincenzo scored 18 of Villanova’s first 32 points. While his teammates hit just five of their first 17 shots, he rallied the Wildcats to a halftime lead, 37-28.
“Honestly, when I got into the game, all I was trying to do was play hard,” DiVincenzo said. “I just wanted to help my team offensively.”

Michigan was said to be the team of destiny a year ago, after its plane slid off a runway before the Big Ten tournament, inspiring a furious winning streak that ended in the N.C.A.A.’s round of 16.
But a team-bonding trip this summer to a paintball facility in Pinckney, Mich., revealed to the coaching staff a cohesive, fun-loving group sprinkled with freshmen and seniors, each with a surprising killer instinct.
Michigan was 9-5 this season when trailing at halftime, including Saturday’s comeback victory against Loyola-Chicago, which propelled the Wolverines to the national championship game for the first time since 2013, when they lost to Louisville.
But even after their record-setting offensive show on Saturday, Villanova’s players insisted their performance was only possible because of their defense. A team meeting in February refocused the Wildcats on the defensive end; their offense was reliable enough.
On nights when shots were not falling, though, Villanova needed to make sure it could find other ways to win — like it did Monday. Jalen Brunson showed flashes of frustration, Omari Spellman was neutralized and Paschall was conspicuously quiet.
Yet Villanova outrebounded Michigan, 38-27, and held the Wolverines to only three 3-pointers.
“I don’t care if you go back 20 years,” Beilein said, “they would win a lot of Final Fours.”

An unlikely hero emerged. The juggernaut rolled on.
Victor Mather and Joe Drape break down how Villanova beat Michigan in the championship game:
Michigan cuts Villanova’s lead to 12 before Donte DiVincenzo nails a long 3-pointer. And then another. He has 27 points and Villanova leads 62-44 with seven and a half minutes to go. It’s hard to see Michigan even getting to 62.
Drape: I’d start a team with DiVincenzo and Moritz Wagner. They are trading baskets. Sadly, neither one is likely an N.B.A. journeyman let alone a star. But they are putting on a show. When finally Matthews gets a steal and a layup to cut Villanova’s lead to 12, DiVincenzo answers with back-to-back 3-pointers. Michigan needs something NOW.
Mikal Bridges, quiet in the first half, hits a 3 and then a layup. The lead has never quite made it to 20 points, but has never gone down to single digits either. It’s 53-38 with 12 minutes to go.

Moritz Wagner puts a hand into Omani Spellman’s face and is called for an offensive foul. Words are exchanged, and there is a double technical.
Drape: Moritz Wagner can’t do this alone. He is going elbow to elbow, chest to chest with Villanova and just got his third foul. I don’t think Beilein can take him out down 15 even though there are more than 15 minutes to play. No one has come to his or Michigan’s rescue. Not looking good for the Wolverines.
Villanova’s record-setting offense is fully on now, and its last five field goals were by five different players. The team is still only 5-for-17 from 3-point range, but other shots are falling, and Michigan is struggling to make baskets. The lead is 15.
Moritz Wagner started the half with an easy bucket for Michigan, but Villanova answered with a basket by Mikal Bridges and then a 3-pointer and a 2-pointer by Eric Paschall. Villanova leads by 44-30 and the game is slipping away from Michigan.
Drape: Eric Paschall was invisible in the first half, but then he pops a 3-pointer and takes it to the rim, and suddenly Villanova is up 14 points. He is a testament to how Villanova Coach Jay Wright finds used, or at least tarnished parts. Paschall, a redshirt junior transferred from Fordham. Against Kansas, Paschall scored 24 points on 10-of-11 field goals, including 4-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. Michigan is in trouble if he wakes up.
Michigan had a 7-point lead and was playing swarming defense, and Villanova couldn’t make a 3-pointer. Fans could be forgiven for thinking an upset was in the cards. But a run of baskets by reserve Donte DiVincenzo helped Villanova take the lead, and as the half drew to a close, the favorites looked like favorites with a 37-28 lead. DiVincenzo had 18 points, including three of the team’s four 3-pointers (a far cry from the 13 they hit in the first half against Kansas.)
Moritz Wagner of Michigan looked great for five minutes, but mostly vanished thereafter and wound up with 11 points and five rebounds. Villanova’s 4-for-13 3-point shooting seemed slightly disappointing until compared with Michigan’s 2-13.
Drape: Jalen Brunson, the national player of the year, was having a quiet night until he popped a 3-pointer with 15 seconds left to put Villanova up 37-28. His teammate Mikal Bridges, a projected lottery pick, has been even quieter: 4 points. Still the Wildcats go into a halftime with a 9-point lead.

Michigan Coach John Beilein should be worried. If those two have finally found their groove, the Wolverines are going to get run out of the arena. The Wolverines have defended the 3-pointer (no surprise, they are the best in the nation) and held the Wildcats to just 30 percent shooting from beyond the arc. Still, Villanova has moved inside and shot 45 percent to Michigan’s 39 percent. The Wildcats have outrebounded Michigan 20-14.
Michigan’s Moritz Wagner is a force, but he needs help. Pink Shoes (Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman) has stepped up, but the rest of the Wolverines have been dismal. One of them needs a DiVincenzo-like second half. My money is on Matthews, who is just 1 of 5 and has essentially disappeared. Look for Michigan to get him the ball early. The first six minutes of the second half will show us if Michigan can stop the bleeding and push Villanova into a back and forth game. Very good first half; looking for a better second half.
Jalen Brunson buries his first 3-pointer, with Michigan’s defenders conspicuously absent. Michigan misses, and it’s 37-28 Villanova, with the Wildcats also getting the last shot with 12 seconds to play.
Slam dunk by the revelatory Donte DiVincenzo. His season high was 30 against Butler, so he has the ability to run up a big number. Then Spellman adds a dunk. Meanwhile, Michigan is doing a lot of missing, including their last seven from 3-point range. It’s 34-28 Villanova, and with a minute and a half to go, Michigan calls timeout.
Drape: There is recruiting and there is being in the right place at the right time. Ask Donte DiVincenzo. He was on recruiters’ radars: he was ranked as the No. 124 player in the country and the 37th-best shooting guard as a high school senior. He was also the top-rated player in Delaware, not all that far from Villanova’s campus in Philadelphia. His decision was between Syracuse and Villanova until his high school team visited Villanova to watch a practice. He’s got 18 points in the national championship right now.
Villanova takes the lead with its third 3-pointer of the game, all by Donte DiVincenzo. Michigan has been called for 8 fouls, to Villanova’s 4. With a 30-26 lead and the momentum, Villanova starting to look like the favorite for the first time. DiVincenzo now has 14 points, while his more heralded teammates Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson have 4 apiece.
Drape: Villanova is showing they are the real thing, and can give as good as they get. DiVincenzo bangs a 3-pointer, then drives and gets fouled. He misses the free throw, but Villanova is up 30-26 with 3:59 left. So far, we are getting what we were hoping for: a well played, high octane game between the two best teams in the country.
This is a matchup between the best 3-point shooting team in the nation in Villanova (and all of college basketball according to the record book) and the best defending 3-point team in Michigan. So far, the Wolverines are defending better than the Wildcats are shooting. They lead, 21-16.

Charles Matthews has a block and a steal already as Michigan continues its outstanding team defense. Villanova turns to its bench to try to turn things around: Donte Divinceno finally hits the team’s first 3-pointer, then completes a 3-point play. But Michigan’s own bench player Jordan Poole answers to give Michigan an 18-14 lead with 12 minutes left in the half.
 Drape: It’s the shoes. The pink ones. Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman first wore them on February 14 to honor breast cancer victims. He’s worn them ever since and the Wolverines are on a 14 game winning streak. I took my son and nephew to the Big Ten tournament and they fell in love with “Pink Shoes,” as they called Abdur Rahkman. It seems that is the nickname his teammates have given him. Every prognosticator in the media world predicted Villanova would blow Michigan out. Wolverines are not letting that happen.
After all the talk of 3-pointers, the game started on the inside, with each team making a couple of easy buckets. Jalen Brunson and Moritz Wagner were the first to score, but Wagner of Michigan hit the first 3 of the game, giving Michigan a 9-4 lead. In contrast to Kansas in the semifinal, Michigan is swarming Villanova much more aggressively. With 14 minutes left there is a TV timeout and Michigan leads, 11-8. Still no 3’s from Villanova.
 Drape: Unlike in the national semifinals, both teams have come out loose and effective. Michigan’s Wagner has taken it to the hole confidently. The Wolverines have set a tone that they were not going to be intimidated. They want to control the tempo and they have. Wagner has been the spark plug. He hit a big 3-pointer. Then banked it inside on a twisting drive. He has the predominately-Michigan crowd into the game. They are not going to let Villanova shoot them out of the game like the Wildcats did to Kansas early.

By the time Giancarlo Cruz Michael Stanton was in junior high school, he had grown weary of classmates mocking him for his given name and of teachers and coaches mangling the pronunciation of it. His friend Enrique didn’t care for his own name, either.
Together they made a pact. They would go by Mike and Ricky.
“He came in one day,” said Stanton’s mother, Jacinta Garay, “and said: ‘Mom, I hate my name. Why did you name me that?’ And on and on.”
What Stanton didn’t know was that it could have been worse. His mother was going to name him Fidel.
“No, you’re not,” she recalled her husband telling her at the time. “No, you’re not. No, you’re not. No, you’re not.”
Advertisement
Mike Stanton, now her ex-husband, stood his ground.
“That,” he recalled in March, sitting with Garay in the living room of her home in the Los Angeles area, “was something worth fighting for.”
Advertisement
A week later, outside the Yankees’ spring training clubhouse in Tampa, Fla., Giancarlo Stanton said he had no idea about any of this.
“Nuh-uh,” he said, laughing, but also realizing the name Fidel wouldn’t have gone over well with the Cuban exile community in South Florida. The Marlins drafted him in 2007 as a 17-year-old, eventually awarded him a $325 million contract and watched him develop into a National League  most valuable player before trading him to the Yankees in December.
“Thank you for not naming me that, especially being drafted by Miami,” said Stanton, who will make his home debut for the Yankees on Monday afternoon. “That would have been not so good.”
We are all born into names, and, like circumstance, some are more fortunate than others, particularly for athletes. Amid the dysfunction of the Knicks, Carmelo Anthony’s countenance remained Melo. Why wouldn’t Noah Syndergaard, towering with flowing blond hair, embrace his distant heritage and answer to the name fans gave him, Thor? And there would not be an admonition for all to rise for Aaron Judge if his adoptive parents had been named Jones.
While some athletes are destined to embody their names, Stanton’s name — polyglot, lyrical and lengthy — may reveal something about him, too.
If he had stayed with Mike — the name he used publicly through high school and during his first two seasons with the Marlins — he would not even be the first Mike Stanton to play for the Yankees. But there has never been another Giancarlo to play in the major leagues.
“You’ve got something unique, you don’t run from it, you embrace it,” said Stanton, whose bats and gloves have always been stamped with “Giancarlo.” “I’ve met some cool fans that come up and say, ‘Hey, we’ve got the same name.’ But, personally, there’s no one in my phone that I say, ‘Oh, what up, Giancarlo?’ I like the uniqueness of it.”
Advertisement
That is not to say he minds what people call him. His mother calls him Cruz, his father calls him Mike, relatives call him Mikey and his new teammates mostly call him G. His parents gave him so many names, they said, in part so he could choose the one he liked.
When Giancarlo was learning how to write, he made a drawing for his father. He spelled out his first name, all in lowercase, with brightly colored markers. His father took it to work at the post office and hung it in his locker.
If it was hard then to see his son growing up to be one of baseball’s best players, it was easier in that drawing to see an expression of what he might become — his attention to detail, his zest for rich experiences and an embrace of his name.
In that way, along with his uncommon size, 6 feet 6 inches and 245 pounds, Stanton seems to be neatly tailored for New York and all that it has to offer. Until now, his exposure to the city’s culture, clubs and cuisine has come in small bites: a night out here, a weekend there. Home runs, like the two he hit on opening day on Thursday in Toronto, will make it easier for the fans to embrace him. But they will also make it harder for him to blend into the background.
Stanton was raised in the melting pot Tujunga area of Los Angeles by a mother and father who were poles apart. His parents were married for 10 years — splitting up when he was 8 — and seem to have but one thing in common: They both worked for the Postal Service.
Mike has the wit and fashion sense of a suburban dad — khaki shorts with the shirt tucked in, white socks, a sweatband on his wrist — and is as deeply abiding as one. He was there for his son growing up — throwing him batting practice after school before putting in a night shift — and in his moment of peril, accompanying him to a hospital when he was horrifically hit in the face by a pitch in 2014.
Jacinta Garay, whose parents were African-American and Puerto Rican, has piercings on each cheek and musical tastes ranging from Afro-Latin jazz to Lynyrd Skynyrd. She recently got her first cellphone so Giancarlo no longer had to leave a message on the house phone to reach her. But she still rates as a cool enough mom that Stanton invited her to his birthday party at a Hollywood club so she could meet Snoop Dogg.
Of her son’s predilection for haute couture (and flashy sneakers, including a pair of gold metallic high tops), his mother said: “He’s really into coordination and how things look and how to match the colors. The bling tennis shoes — he gets that from me. And he teases me about the furry boots?”
Advertisement
Said his father, with resignation: “He didn’t learn how to dress from me.”
When it came to naming her children, Garay’s eclectic tastes mostly reigned. Her older son, Egidio Carlos Moacir Garay, has a first name she found poetic with the Portuguese soft “g” (pronounced e-JID-e-o) — but off-putting with a hard Spanish “g.” Moacir is a nod to the Brazilian jazz composer Moacir Santos.

Her daughter, who is two years older than Giancarlo (pronounced zhon-CAR-lo), was supposed to be a boy, so Kyricio became Kyrice (pronounced KIE-reece); her middle name is Valivia, the name of Garay’s grandmother.
When her plan to name her younger son Fidel was quashed, she pondered an alternative. An aficionado of foreign and independent films, Garay revered the actors Giancarlo Giannini and Giancarlo Esposito, and she liked the way the name sounded. “I talked to my cousin and she was, ‘Yeah, let’s do it,’ because we just loved the way that Giancarlo flows,” Garay said, pronouncing it with a flourish.
(Stanton’s second name came because his mother’s favorite singer was Celia Cruz and because an actor who lived in the neighborhood — A Martinez — played a character named Cruz on the late-1980s soap opera “Santa Barbara.”)
If their names caused occasional angst, the children did not stew over it. Egidio went by E. G., Kyrice went by Ky and Giancarlo became Mike.
“We just chalked it up to, my mom went to too many Parliament concerts in the ’70s,” said Egidio, 38, who teaches political science at Glendale Community College in California. “It just kind of was. It wasn’t something we spent a lot of time deconstructing.”
In retrospect, though, their names may have subtly spurred his worldview.
“Growing up in more suburban areas where you have that name that stands out, it’s already pointing you out as being a little different,” Egidio said. “Being a little kid in first grade being picked on for your ethnicity and identity, it compels you to make those broader connections to cultures and have a wider horizon about the world.”
For Giancarlo, there were other nudges to do that. His father had traveled to China, India and Africa. His uncle Miguele would bring him gifts and regale him with tales about his frequent visits to Colombia, and take him to local Latin festivals. Giancarlo’s eyes were opened further when he took a trip with high school classmates to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, at the tip of Baja California Sur. He went fishing, rode all-terrain vehicles on the beach, ate Mexican food and listened to mariachi.
“It was fascinating to me,” said Stanton, who in recent off-seasons began to explore Europe, and then places further afield, cities like Istanbul, Bucharest, Jerusalem and Dubai. Asia and South America are being considered as the next possible destinations. “You don’t understand until you grow up a little bit how cool places are.”
The more recent trips have been with two housemates — the former Marlins pitchers A. J. Ramos and Ricky Nolasco — and another friend, the Marlins clubhouse attendant Jeremy Ruder.
Advertisement
Stanton’s Instagram feed — a montage of photos from shirtless workouts, vacation spots, celebrity hobnobbing and other areas of the baseball life — are often accompanied by pithy captions that show an often self-deprecating wit.
“On the field it’s hard to joke around — I’m game time,” Stanton said. “But off, when I’m not working, I’m a jokester. I don’t want to spend all my energy being mad and focused.”
While Stanton’s Yankees teammates have been struck by how fastidiously he adheres to his hitting and workout routines, he is adamant about leaving his work at the office. He has told his father, at times, that he does not want to talk about baseball with him. And Ramos, who has lived with him since 2011, said that in the time they have known each other, they have not had more than 10 conversations about baseball away from the ballpark.
The travels over the winter also provide a necessary break from baseball.
“We play seven months, counting spring training, and you’re so regimented that if you don’t get away it makes you crazy,” said Ramos, the Mets reliever who will share an apartment with Stanton in New York this season. “We actually set a plan for what we want to do, and 100 percent of that time we don’t even stick to that plan. There’s no one holding us to it but us. That’s the balance.”
While Ramos has relished experiences like riding to a pyramid in Egypt on camelback — “It looks fake, like it’s in a movie,” he said — their group also returned home with conversations that challenged the way they think. “You go there and you see what’s true and not true,” he said.
For Stanton, his first trip to Europe was a transformational one. Though it was regimented — he did baseball clinics in the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Italy after the 2011 season — the architecture, the food and the culture were unlike anything he had seen growing up in Los Angeles, bouncing through minor league towns or living in Miami.
He also noticed how it sounded to hear names like Gianpiero, Gianpaolo, Gianluigi and even Giancarlo.
Advertisement
When he returned to Los Angeles, he matter-of-factly mentioned to his parents that the next season he was no longer going to go by Mike.
“I was shocked,” his mother said. “I had my mouth open for a week. He’s going to go by Giancarlo now? Are you serious?”
“Yeah,” his father said. “I didn’t see it coming.”
Stanton said it was simply a matter of growing up, of coming to a fuller appreciation of what was important to him. And part of that was making sure that people knew him not only by the home runs he hit, but also by his name.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Pernilla Lindberg made a 30-foot birdie putt on the eighth extra hole to win the ANA Inspiration on Monday for her first professional victory.
Lindberg finished off Inbee Park on the par-4 10th, the fourth playoff hole Monday at Mission Hills after they played until it was too dark to see — and then played some more — Sunday night.
“I just know I’m a grinder, and I just felt: ‘This is mine. I’m going to do this,’” Lindberg, 31, said. “I just knew I could, and I just kept fighting away. I couldn’t believe when that last putt went in.”
Park had a chance to force another hole, but her 20-footer stopped on the edge of the cup.
“The first thing I said when I holed that last putt was, ‘I know Inbee’s going to hole hers,’ too,’” Lindberg said. “So, I started thinking about the 17th hole again, but she didn’t. It was mine.”

Lindberg, a Swede, won the major championship in her 250th start on the L.P.G.A., Ladies European and Symetra tours, making the traditional victory leap into Poppie’s Pond with her parents and Daniel Taylor, her fiancé and caddie.

“ I’ve probably given my dad I don’t know how many heart attacks over the last few days, but I’m just so happy they’re here and get to see this and we get to celebrate it together,” Lindberg said.
On Sunday, Jennifer Song dropped out off the playoff with a par on the third hole, and Park and Lindberg decided to take one more trip down the par-5 18th in fading light. With portable lights and the scoreboard helping illuminate the green, Park holed a six-footer for par and Lindberg made a short putt to match. They finished at 7:21 p.m., 15 minutes after sunset.
Play resumed at 8 a.m. Monday on No. 10, with Lindbergh leaving a birdie putt an inch short. They made up-and-down pars on the par-3 17th, with Park holing a tricky eight-foot downhill putt and Lindberg staying alive from a foot closer.
Lindberg then reached the 18th in two — the first time one of them went for it in the six times they played the par-5 hole in the playoff and regulation — but was on the far left side and was only able to get her eagle putt within seven feet. Park laid up and hit a wedge to eight feet. They both missed.

“I didn’t make many mistakes, but I just couldn’t make the putts,” Park said. “The morning greens were a little bit slower than I anticipated. I hit a couple putts short. I had a couple of opportunities. I’m a little bit disappointed, but I’m really happy the way I played this week.”
Lindberg, Park and Song birdied the 18th in regulation. Song got to 15-under first with a five-foot putt, Park followed with a four-footer in the next group and Lindberg matched her in the final group. Park and Song shot five-under 67, and Lindberg had a 71.
Lindberg is the fourth player to lead wire-to-wire in the event and first since Pat Hurst in 1998, and the fifth to win the tournament for her first L.P.G.A. Tour victory. She’s the sixth Swedish female major champion, joining Liselotte Neumann, Helen Alfredsson, Jenny Lidback (born in Peru to Swedish parents), Annika Sorenstam and Anna Nordqvist — and all of them won a major for her first L.P.G.A. Tour title.
“I remember writing some goals probably right when I got to high school,” Lindberg said. “Writing about the dream scenario, and it would be to obviously win a major championship and leave a mark in history. But at the same time it felt like too big of a dream to come true, but it has.”

Park, the 29-year-old Hall of Famer, won in 2013 at Mission Hills and is a seven-time major champion. She won the Founders Cup two weeks ago for her 19th tour title, a day after revealing she was 50-50 about retiring before returning from a long break. She returned to play a month ago in Singapore after not playing since the Women’s British Open in August.
“The putt Pernilla made on the last was a champion’s putt,” Park said. “I’m really happy for her. This one was not an easy major win for her, as well. I mean, eight-hole playoff, I’ve never done something like that before, either.”
Jessica Korda and Ariya Jutanugarn finished a stroke out of the playoff.

SAN ANTONIO — This year’s men’s Final Four seemed to go off without a hitch. All of its participants — Villanova, Kansas, Michigan and Loyola-Chicago — made it to Texas without trouble. Trading the cold and rain of their campuses for the warm Texas sun probably did not bother any of them.
But had, say, 11th-seeded San Diego State instead of 11th-seeded Loyola-Chicago made an improbable run to the N.C.A.A.  tournament’s third weekend, the Aztecs’ visit to the Lone Star State might have caused a fuss. And in future years, an even more dire complication could arise: A college team might not be permitted to attend a championship event.
The reason is that several states have enacted laws banning state-funded travel to certain other states because of legal climates seen as discriminatory, including those related to so-called religious freedom or bathroom bills. The states most commonly the focus of the roughly half-dozen bans are North Carolina and Mississippi. California has a law prohibiting taxpayer-funded travel to eight states, including several that frequently host college championship events: not only North Carolina, but also Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee — and Texas.
In essence, and with several exceptions, the California law bans the use of state money to pay for travel to those states, a prohibition that generally applies to California’s numerous public universities, including, arguably, their sports teams.

Still, San Diego State’s men’s basketball team did, in fact, travel to Kansas last month to play on the tournament’s first weekend (the Aztecs lost to Houston in the first round in Wichita). And last year, U.C.L.A. played in the second weekend of the tournament in Memphis.

California’s public university teams have felt compelled to devise legal workarounds. The men’s basketball committee, which selected the 36 teams that received at-large bids to the N.C.A.A. tournament and seeded all 68 in the field, disregarded state travel bans, said its chairman, Bruce Rasmussen, the Creighton athletic director.
“We, unfortunately, do not control where we play in the tournament, and we will not deny our student-athletes the opportunity for postseason play,” Shana Wilson, a senior associate athletic director for U.C.L.A., wrote in an email. She confirmed that last year, U.C.L.A. used revenue generated by the athletic department — sources like ticket sales, donations and sponsorships, but not direct state funding — to pay for the Bruins’ trip to Memphis.
San Diego State, which is in the California State University system, used revenue from donations to finance the basketball team’s trip to Kansas in March, as well as its football team’s trip to Fort Worth to play Army in the Armed Forces Bowl last December, said Chuck Lang, a senior associate athletic director.
“We avoid going to them as much as possible,” said Lang, referring to the eight banned states.
San Diego State does not schedule nonconference road competitions against teams in those states, though Lang said other Aztecs squads had traveled to them “because we had to” for other N.C.A.A. championship events.
Some opponents of the laws that the travel bans were meant to challenge remain uneasy about such accommodations, saying they circumvent the bans’ spirit, if not their letter.
“We would prefer that in states that have active travel bans, that organizations and agencies in those states honor those bans,” said Thomas Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group.
Kansas showed up on California’s list after its state government passed a law in 2016 that permitted groups on Kansas campuses to turn away prospective members who did not share their religious beliefs. Supporters of that law say it protects religious freedom; detractors like Witt say it inappropriately allows state-financed groups to discriminate.

It is debatable whether California’s travel ban applies to sports teams’ travel to N.C.A.A. championship events like the men’s basketball tournament. The law lists several exceptions under which state funds can be used to travel to those states, including for litigation or to comply with a federal request to appear before a committee. One of the exceptions is “to meet contractual obligations incurred before January 1, 2017.”

San Diego State had been a member of both the N.C.A.A. and the Mountain West Conference (which has a contract with the Armed Forces Bowl) before that date, Lang said, so the university concluded that its teams’ participation fell under that exception. Yet it used non-taxpayer funds to pay for the trip anyway, Lang said, “out of an abundance of caution.”
The California attorney general’s office has been considering whether the ban applies to “University of California and California State University athletic team staffs” for nearly a year. But the question remains unanswered. The attorney general’s office declined to comment for this article.
In the past, the N.C.A.A. has taken a stand in reaction to some state laws. It opposed the 2014 “religious freedom” law in Indiana, where the association is headquartered. And before last year’s tournament, it responded to North Carolina’s passage of a notorious bill that put restrictions on bathroom access for transgender citizens by pulling some events from the state and threatening not to schedule more there. In both cases, the N.C.A.A.’s public opposition played a significant role in the laws’ subsequent modification or repeal, with the N.C.A.A. going on to keep events in those states and schedule others.
The N.C.A.A. sends a questionnaire to prospective host sites asking how they plan to accommodate all participants or spectators, including those who are gay or transgender. Although the association moved a basketball subregional out of North Carolina last year, it seems to recognize the extreme difficulty in making plans, often years in advance, around the shifting political priorities of all 50 states where it has members.
“We can’t control what states’ laws are, nor should we,” Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, said last year.
“If any state says they’re not going to travel to any other place for some other reason,” he added, “We can’t then say, ‘Well, we’ve decided we’re not going to go there because another state has decided it.’”
Several future N.C.A.A. championship sites could test this question. The Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments alone have scheduled several regionals and subregionals in states on California’s list. Several Division II baseball tournaments, including this year’s, are planned for North Carolina.
As with many boycotts, the travel bans stir complex feelings even among their supporters. Witt, who supports travel bans, acknowledged that he is based in a state that takes college basketball extremely seriously, and watched its flagship university make the Final Four this year.
“There are a lot of fans in the L.G.B.T. Kansas community who are big-time basketball, and K.U. basketball, fans,” Witt said.

It is as if Lionel Messi or LeBron James were banned for a year for cheating. But in this case the superstar is Steve Smith, one of the best cricketers in the world and the captain of the national team in Australia, where fair play is prized and cricket is a national obsession.
On Thursday, Smith returned to Australia, which was still reeling from the scandal and demanding answers over his failing to intervene in a ball-tampering scheme while on tour in South Africa and initially lying about it to sports officials and the news media.
Cricket Australia has lost its naming sponsor only seven months into a three-year, $15 million contract. But more broadly the country is coming to grips with cheating in one its most popular sports, and asking itself if its self-satisfaction in fair play was a myth all along.
“I know I will regret this for the rest of my life,” Smith said, fighting back tears at a news conference in Sydney. “I made a serious error of judgment and I now understand the consequences. It was a failure of my leadership. I will do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused.”

But to understand the fall of Smith, who was barred from all Australian international and domestic cricket for 12 months and from the 2018 season of the Indian Premier League, it is necessary to understand his rise.
Advertisement
In Test cricket — the traditional five-day format of the sport — among all players who have scored at least 2,000 runs, Smith has the second-best career average per innings. His 61.37 average is behind only that of Sir Donald Bradman, whose 99.94 average is so far ahead of the competition that, to cricket fans, mere utterance of those four digits evokes his name.
Smith’s ascent has been particularly cherished because he seemed to represent traits that Australians like to consider their own.
He was largely self-taught. He honed his technique by playing in his back garden, on uneven paving, drawing comparisons to Bradman, who spent hours throwing a golf ball against a water tank, and hitting it with a stump.
Another resonant trait is Smith’s sheer resilience and audacity.
At the start of his international career, Smith was widely regarded as a joke. When Smith was recalled by Australia midway through the team’s humiliating defeat by England in 2010-11, he shrugged it off, explaining that his role was merely about “having fun and making sure everyone else around is having fun, whether it be telling a joke or something like that.”
Although his batting technique was dissected ruthlessly, Smith went on to double down on his idiosyncratic method, and enjoyed a sustained run of success that is one of the more remarkable in cricket history. Since a match in Perth at the end of 2013, which Smith has identified as the turning point in his career, he averages 70.71 in Test matches, scoring a century every four innings.
He has done all this with an everyman appeal endearing to Australians. He is “one of the more genuinely decent people to skipper the Australian team in recent decades,” the longtime cricket journalist Peter Lalor wrote in The Australian. He is so driven and obsessed with the sport that his fiancée has said that Smith sometimes makes her throw balls into the bowling machine, to give him extra batting practice.

So the revelations about the match in South Africa have left Australia aghast.
It has been confirmed that Smith did not intervene despite full knowledge that the team’s vice captain, David Warner, was instructing Cameron Bancroft, the most junior player, to rub sandpaper on the ball, altering its aerodynamics.

Warner also received a yearlong suspension, and Bancroft was barred for nine months.
“To see the way my old man has been, and my mum, it hurts,” Smith said. “I just want to say I’m sorry for the pain I have brought to Australia and the fans and the public. It’s devastating.”
Some have offered sympathy or support for Smith.
“Hope everybody has had their pound of flesh now,” said Mark Butcher, a former English player.
Faf du Plessis, South Africa’s captain, who has twice been reprimanded for tampering — he was fined, never suspended — sent Smith a text message to express his sympathies. “I feel for the guy,” du Plessis said, adding that he considered the length of the ban harsh.
Others, however, said the punishment would send an appropriate message.
There is a link between Australia’s “boorish and arrogant” behavior over the last few years and this incident, wrote Mickey Arthur, a South African who coached Australia from 2011 to 2013. “Cricket Australia needed to make a stand.”
Beyond the specifics, this episode promises to have wider repercussions. In the sport generally, it is inviting a debate about ball tampering — widely believed to be endemic in the sport, albeit more subtly than by Australia’s players last week — and the game’s entire conduct, after myriad recent problems with behavior.
David Richardson, chief executive of the International Cricket Council, the sport’s governing body, said, “Enough is enough” after “one of the worst periods in recent memory” for the game.
In Australia, the affair is raising questions about the country’s notion of being the land of the “fair go,” and whether the cricket team’s apparent “win at all costs” approach is emblematic of a deeper strand in the country.
The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said that many high commissioners and ambassadors had declared their shock over the incident, and that it had damaged the country’s reputation abroad.

“Australia is seen as a country that plays fair, that plays by the rules, abides by the rules,” she said.
Smith is unlikely to captain Australia again. But, at only 28 years old, he is widely expected to make an international comeback after his ban.
“Cricket is the greatest game in the world,” Smith said. “It’s been my life, and I hope it can be again. Good people make mistakes.”

The Charlotte Hornets have formally offered their vacant general manager position to the longtime Los Angeles Lakers executive Mitch Kupchak, according to three people with knowledge of the offer.
The Hornets, who are owned by Michael Jordan, are confident they will soon seal a new contract with Kupchak to take over their basketball operations and are progressing toward a deal, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations publicly.
Kupchak, like Jordan a former collegiate star at the University of North Carolina, quickly emerged as the favorite for the post after Charlotte announced in late February that their former general manager, Rich Cho, who was in the final year of his contract, would not be retained.
The Hornets have not responded to repeated requests for comment. Kupchak declined to comment on Monday.

Cho was hired as the Hornets’ general manager in 2011 and became the lead voice in Charlotte’s front office in 2014. The Hornets are likely to miss the playoffs for the third time in the five-season tenure of Coach Steve Clifford.

Kupchak’s lengthy run with the Lakers, which spanned nearly four decades and began when he joined them as a player in 1981, included 30 years in the front office and 17 as the head of the Lakers’ front office until his abrupt dismissal in February 2017 — 19 days after Magic Johnson returned to the Lakers in an executive role.
The Lakers won four championships with Kupchak in charge — two of them after his acquisition of Pau Gasol in a February 2008 trade with the Memphis Grizzlies.

But Kupchak gradually fell out of favor with the Lakers’ owner Jeanie Buss after the team’s steady decline in recent seasons, which resulted in the dual dismissals of Kupchak and Jeanie’s brother, Jim, last February. Those moves were followed by the installation of the legendary former Lakers point guard Johnson and the longtime player agent Rob Pelinka as the Lakers’ new front-office tandem.

In the past few weeks, Tiger Woods has made a seemingly improbable comeback on the golf course. But can his image rebound the same way off it?
That is the question that brands and advertisers are posing as Mr. Woods returns to the Masters on Thursday for the first time since 2015, while playing his best golf in years. The past month has brought swelling television ratings and overcrowded, rowdy galleries for Mr. Woods’s PGA Tour appearances. When he finished in a second-place tie at the Valspar Championship in early March — at one point sinking a 44-foot birdie putt that had the crowd screaming — the television ratings for the final round were the highest for a non-major tournament since 2013. For a time, the streaming service of PGA Tour Live crashed because of “unprecedented traffic.”
All this is evoking memories of the unprecedented fan interest that made Mr. Woods one of the most recognized — and influential — athletes for more than a decade, worth about $90 million per year in endorsement contracts alone.
But it has been a while. The fallout from the 2009 revelations of his extramarital affairs cost him endorsement deals with Gatorade, AT&T, General Motors and Gillette, among others. The few companies that stood by him, namely Nike, did so despite multiple injury-plagued and underwhelming seasons; since 2010, Mr. Woods has eight PGA Tour wins, after winning 71 times in the 14 previous years.

“He has a little bit of wind in his sails,” said David Carter, a professor of sports business at the University of Southern California. “The key is going to be can he win, can he stay healthy and can he stay out of trouble? If he can do that and remain competitive, then I think the big brands will return.”

Some brands had already bet on a Tiger Woods comeback, even when it looked unlikely. Bridgestone reached out to Mr. Woods about playing its golf ball in September 2016, shortly after Nike announced that it would no longer be selling golf equipment (though it would continue its Woods-branded clothing line). It hardly mattered that Mr. Woods had not appeared in a tournament in 13 months.
Angel Ilagan, Bridgestone Golf’s chief executive, said in a recent interview that the company had sent 12 dozen balls to Mr. Woods, hoping he would attach his name and endorsement to the product, which he eventually did, signing a multi-year contract in December of that year
“We know Tiger’s brand strength,” Mr. Ilagan said. “Whether he does play or not doesn’t really matter. That’s just icing on the cake.”
With Mr. Woods apparently close to his previous form — he is the betting favorite to win his fifth green jacket at the Masters — that icing is already tasting sweet. Already in 2018, Bridgestone’s sales of golf balls have increased 115 percent over the same period a year ago. Mr. Ilagan attributed that to Mr. Woods; Bridgestone has already begun to market a Woods edition golf ball, which it introduced on Wednesday.
TaylorMade, which signed Mr. Woods to use its clubs in January last year, said it saw no need to build a marketing campaign around the star, because the mere fact that he plays with the clubs or talks about their performance in interviews does the selling job.
“When Tiger says something, the world takes notice,” David Abeles, the company’s chief executive, said. “Because it’s true. We’re excited just when he talks in his own words.”
Mr. Ilagan suggested that Mr. Woods’s rebound from the dramatic turn his career took in 2009 had made him more relatable and perhaps likable for fans. “His absence showed what was missing when he wasn’t there,” Mr. Ilagan said.

Martin Buckley, global vice president and general manager of Nike Golf, which sells a full line of Woods-branded clothing, including shoes, shirts and sweaters, said that fans would be seeing a lot more of him in Nike advertisements this summer.
“He’s a unique, integral part of the Nike family,” Mr. Buckley wrote in an email, “and we don’t see that changing any time soon.”
But while performance brands remain aligned with Mr. Woods, more mainstream companies have not yet jumped back on the bandwagon. Peter Land, a partner at Finsbury, the strategic communications firm, suspects a reason could be that Mr. Woods likely alienated women when news about his extramarital affairs surfaced.
“Brands with a strong female stakeholder base will continue to be a struggle for Tiger,” said Mr. Land, who was with PepsiCo when Gatorade, which PepsiCo owns, decided to drop Mr. Woods. “There are so many other successful and charismatic global athletes to partner with — and they come with a lower risk profile.”

The companies that might benefit most from Mr. Woods’s resurgence could be the ones that got onboard a few years ago, seizing on a “buy low” opportunity, said Mr. Carter, the University of Southern California professor.
Full Swing Golf, which makes golf simulators, started a relationship with Mr. Woods in 2014, when he was rehabbing from injury. Its chief executive, Ryan Dotters, thought Mr. Woods could use the simulator to train indoors, and Mr. Woods was receptive.
“It was definitely a strategic move,” Mr. Dotters said. “We felt no matter what Tiger had gone through in the past, we knew his brand was extremely strong. We thought there was a big opportunity there.”
The relationship has not always been easy. Last May, Mr. Woods was arrested and charged with driving under the influence after being found asleep behind the wheel of his Mercedes-Benz. A toxicology report found several powerful painkillers in his system that he said he was taking to cope with his fourth back surgery that spring.
Mr. Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving and agreed to enter a diversion program, which included a year on probation and 50 hours of community service. He had already completed treatment at a clinic for help in dealing with his prescription medications.

This time, his sponsors stood by him.
“I didn’t consider dropping him at all,” Mr. Ilagan said. “We looked into the situation and ascertained that what he did was the right thing. People realized he was about as responsible as he could have been in that situation.”
Bridgestone did conduct a survey after the arrest to gauge the public’s reaction, Mr. Ilagan said. “The results were that the consumers were very supportive of him,” he said.
Mr. Abeles, TaylorMade’s chief executive, said: “We’re all human. We believed in Tiger, and we continue to believe in Tiger.”
Mr. Carter said there would continue to be a certain amount of mistrust when it came to Mr. Woods and the brands he represented.
“Regardless of the circumstances, corporate partners don’t want to see a mug shot,” he said. “It’s not surprising if it may take a little bit of time for mainstream brands to want to hitch their representation to his.”
With that said, though, most fans assumed that Mr. Woods would never recover from his injuries. The golfer with 14 major championships has proved repeatedly throughout his career that it is never safe to count him out.
“I think people in this country are very quick to forgive and forget,” Mr. Carter said. “They want to give people the benefit of the doubt and a second chance. And when you’re a beloved figure like Tiger Woods, I think fans really want to see him come back. He still has this halo effect.”
