Like the Huawei Mate 10 Pro that we reviewed earlier this week, the HTC U11 Plus is a high-spec, high-price flagship phone that’s going to be next to irrelevant in the US because of its lack of availability. But does that make it uninteresting? Not in the slightest.
The U11 Plus has a backstory that could fill an entire book, coming as the result of Google and HTC’s Pixel collaboration, and being the original first-choice candidate for what would ultimately become the Pixel 2 XL made by LG. As the name suggests, this Plus model is also an evolution of the HTC U11, which I personally loved and still rank as one of my favorite phones of 2017. The U11 showed HTC finally getting back on the right track, and when the Plus was announced in November, it just poured more goodies into the offering: bigger battery, bigger 6-inch screen with vastly reduced bezels, and an improved water resistance rating. Plus, of course, a bigger price of €799 / £699 for the European variant I’m reviewing here with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That’s roughly $975, if you’re tempted to go to the trouble of importing one.
With all that pedigree behind it and a laudably fat spec sheet, the HTC U11 Plus was all set to tempt and torment me the way the iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL have been doing lately. But, well, things didn’t turn out as rosy as they initially appeared. The U11 Plus has been a reminder that we should be careful what we wish for.
So what’s my biggest disagreement with the HTC U11 Plus? There’s just too much of it. Weighing 188g, it’s 11 percent heavier than the original U11, which was just comfortable enough to be used like a regular phone with one hand. The U11 Plus is on the wrong side of that fine line, joining devices like the iPhone 8 Plus and Nexus 6P in the awkwardly large and lumpy class of phones. The biggest change is superficially subtle but practically paramount: the U11 has a gorgeous, continuous curve across its entire back, which thins the device toward the outer edges and makes it feel much more compact than it really is. The U11 Plus is basically a fat block with rounded edges.
I’ve long been an advocate for bigger phones with bigger batteries, and that’s exactly what HTC has done with the U11 Plus, but the company has sacrificed the U11’s elegance in this Plus transition. The Mate 10 Pro has a slightly larger battery — 4,000mAh versus the U11 Plus’ 3,930mAh — yet it has a slicker, more desirable design. The Google Pixel 2 XL, which has a 3,520mAh cell, feels much thinner and more refined in the hand than the U11 Plus. Importantly, the Pixel 2 XL has also been an endurance champ in my experience, and the U11 Plus doesn’t offer a tangible improvement — meaning HTC loses out on size, weight, and ergonomics against its most direct rivals without beating them on performance.
There’s shockingly little that I can commend about the HTC U11 Plus’ design. The rear cover is made of highly reflective glass, which might look glamorous and appealing if you only ever handle it with velvet gloves, but in conventional use it’s just a canvas for creating abstract fingerprint art. There’s also a sliver of hollow space under that glass, unfilled by batteries or electronics, which makes it feel flimsy and unreliable. Contrast that with the rock-solid rigidity of the glass-covered iPhone X: the iPhone feels like the $1,000 device that it is, whereas the U11 Plus feels like someone didn’t completely think through the integration of exterior shell and interior components.
On the front, the U11 Plus has HTC’s smallest bezels in a long time. It’s an overdue change for the company, and as such, it’s already behind the curve. These reduced bezels aren’t in the class-leading tier of the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG V30, Essential Phone, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, or the iPhone X. They’re just smaller than before. What makes the change feel unimportant is the bulk of the phone behind it. I still feel like I’m dealing with an unwieldy device, even if it no longer has epic BoomSound speaker bezels. Oh, and that super shiny glass back is a slippery nightmare in the hand. The U11 Plus invokes more bad memories of the U Ultra than happy ones of the U11.
The 6-inch, 18:9 display on the U11 Plus is one of the very few such options on the market that aren’t OLED. It’s Super LCD 6 and, on the strength of this phone’s performance, I have to say Super LCD is just outdated technology now. The display appears lurid, aggressively oversaturated when compared against the Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X. It lacks the sharpness, contrast, and accuracy of OLED rivals. HTC touts that it has a DCI-P3 mode (enabled by default) on the U11 Plus for improved color accuracy, but that’s sadly nonsense. My eyeballs feel seared by the overwhelming pinkness of what’s supposed to be red in the Gmail app. This display also lacks the viewing angles of OLED, the importance of which you’ll appreciate any time you use your U11 Plus while it’s lying on a desk and everything looks darker and less accurate.
The best OLED screens of today allow manufacturers to do things that the old LCD panels are incapable of. Google, Motorola, LG, Samsung, and many other Android vendors now sell phones with always-on displays that keep the time, notifications, and upcoming events constantly on the screen. That’s only possible with OLED. If you want a fingerprint sensor integrated into the display, which was one of the highlights of this year’s CES, you’ll only be able to do it with OLED. In this category, HTC is once again outmatched.
The one redeeming quality that could make this phone worth buying is its camera. The U11 Plus camera is a clear step above any and every phone not made by Google. Yes, that includes the iPhone X. There should be no surprises about this fact, because the camera system is lifted directly out of the superb U11, so for the full breakdown of its performance, I shall point you to our HTC U11 review.
In my own comparisons between the HTC U11 Plus and Pixel 2 XL, which involved a lot of zoomed-in pixel peeping, I scored five wins for the HTC phone, six for the Google device, and six ties. It was obvious that Google’s Pixel camera trumps absolutely everyone in low-light photography, but there were a number of occasions where the U11 Plus took the sharper photo and processed the image more intelligently. On the basis of this comparison, I’m almost sure that HTC’s cameras benefit from some of the same algorithmic magic that goes into Google’s Pixel cameras. Google hardware senior vice president Rick Osterloh seemed to suggest as much in an interview with Wired:
“Last year, [HTC] helped us build Pixel, and then a few months later, they shipped the U11, and that phone had the best smartphone camera in the industry.”
The other U11 Plus redeemer is supposed to be its battery. That’s why I’m out here sweating under the burden of this phone’s girth and bulk. But that battery is a very mixed affair. If I don’t turn on the screen, I can grow a beard in the time it takes to tick down a single percentage point. But once I start using the phone, the battery dwindles down surprisingly quickly. The display and camera really sap the life out of the U11 Plus, leaving me feeling flatly underwhelmed. The problem here isn’t that the battery life is bad, it’s that it’s not noticeably superior to slimmer, cheaper, or smaller phones.
As to the actual use of the U11 Plus, I have to reiterate that the display’s color inaccuracy continued to bug me, though it was occasionally overshadowed by the nagging and intrusive bloatware that HTC lades this phone with. Did you know that women are interested in men’s finances? Apparently scientists have confirmed that, according to a random vibrating notification I got from News Republic. This app, along with Facebook apps, and a number of HTC’s own duplicates of Google services, is not removable from the phone. Also, the TouchPal keyboard preloaded on the U11 Plus is utter, unforgivable garbage. Its haptic feedback is junk, its layout is trash, and it leaves me feeling enervated before I’ve even set up the phone. The original U11 shared these flaws, but I was able to overlook them due to its other strengths, including the pretty design.
I’m glad to see HTC shipping the U11 Plus with Android Oreo already loaded up. Even today, many months after Google released its latest operating system, Android vendors continue selling phones with older versions. HTC does the right thing by keeping most of the default Android interface intact, though it also provides its own theme store (which isn’t very good) and it serves up a Sense Companion that, again, tries to duplicate Google Assistant. Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa are both also ready to use on this phone, which is a nice bit of inclusiveness on HTC’s part.
All-around performance on the U11 Plus is fast, fluid, and reliable. If you’re persistent enough, you can certainly add your own launcher, Google’s Gboard, and a number of other tweaks to make using this phone feel tolerable. But that’s an Android advantage rather than an HTC one. HTC hasn’t really taken any opportunity to distinguish itself with its own software know-how; the so-called Active Edge squeeze gimmick is back from the U11, and while it can be deployed to do more now, it still remains a gimmick.
Audio has traditionally been an HTC strength, and the U11 Plus keeps that heritage going. Its dual speaker system provides rich and full tones, rendering voices in a natural and realistic fashion. I’m especially conscious of how voices sound on phone speakers these days, because of how much podcast listening I do and the related possibility of having to carry out a call on the loudspeaker. Without a headphone jack on the U11 Plus, HTC bundles the same pair of USB-C earphones that we already liked with the U11. Once again, they’re incompatible with anything other than HTC’s gear.
Everything was set up for me to love the U11 Plus that little bit more than I did the U11. But what HTC has demonstrated with this phone is that sometimes — perhaps more often than not in the mobile industry — giving people more isn’t necessarily going to make them happier. It’s the same issue that Samsung and LG long suffered from, this desire to maximize specs and numbers at any cost. The U11 Plus might find its audience in dedicated spec or camera geeks, but for me it’s too unrefined, too bloated (both physically and in its software) and, as a result, too expensive to recommend.

Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump, after listening to a series of emotional stories and pleas to enhance school safety at the White House Wednesday, floated the idea of arming teachers and school staff, an idea that was met with support from many of the attendees. 
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!Full Listening Session: https://t.co/x5VenyQX5p pic.twitter.com/CAPfX5odIp

President Trump on Thursday doubled down on his idea of arming some teachers as a deterrent for school shootings and praised the top leadership of the National Rifle Association as “Great American Patriots.”
In morning tweets and later in a “listening session” at the White House, Trump claimed the strategy of arming teachers would be far less costly than hiring guards. He said “gun-free” school zones make it like “going in for ice cream” for school shooters and said on Twitter that with his strategy, “ATTACKS WOULD END!”
His remarks amplified a strategy Trump pushed during a first “listening session” Wednesday at the White House, which included relatives of some of the 17 people killed by a gunman last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida. Thursday's session included law enforcement officers and other officials.

“Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive,” Trump said in one morning tweet.
During the “listening session” a couple of hours later, Trump said he wants “my schools protected just like I want my banks protected.”
The strategy of arming teachers has many critics, including some law enforcement officers and the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers lobby. In a statement Wednesday, NEA president Lily Eskelsen García said, “Educators need to be focused on teaching our students.”
In his tweets, Trump claimed his strategy had been mischaracterized by some news outlets and is more nuanced than reported. He said he envisioned only about 20 percent of teachers having concealed weapons and said they would have “military or special training experience.”
“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school,” Trump said. “Cowards won’t go there ... problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!”
Some criminologists have questioned that reasoning, pointing out that some people who plan to commit mass shootings are prepared to die in the process.
In a later tweet, Trump praised NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and executive director Chris W. Cox, whose organization has advocated not overreacting to last week's shooting.
“What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,” Trump wrote. “They love our Country and will do the right thing.”
“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump added.
In the aftermath of the shooting, Trump has publicly and privately floated actions that would be at odds with the positions of the NRA, one of his biggest supporters in the 2016 campaign.
In a separate tweet Thursday, Trump appeared to highlight one of those conflicts: raising the age for purchasing assault rifles from 18 to 21.
“I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!” Trump said in the tweet. “Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue — I hope!”
In a statement this week, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker noted that federal law prohibits anyone younger than 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed firearms dealer.
“Legislative proposals that prevent law-abiding adults aged 18-20 years old from acquiring rifles and shotguns effectively prohibits them for purchasing any firearm, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to self-protection,” Baker said.
Trump said during Friday's listening session that he thought the NRA would support raising the age to 21.
“I don't think I'll be going up against them. ... They're good people,” said Trump, who also praised the organization more broadly. “The NRA is ready to do things. People like to blame them.”
Vice President Pence did not mention increasing the minimum age as he addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, which is being held in the Washington area this week.
Instead, Pence pointed to Trump's call for members of Congress to “strengthen background checks” and for the Justice Department to expedite new regulations for “bump stocks,” devices that can convert a legal semiautomatic weapon into one that fires like a fully automatic one.
Pence said “the safety of our nation's schools and our students” is a top national priority, and the administration wants to provide law enforcement and American families “the tools they need to deal with those struggling with dangerous mental illness.”
Earlier this week, Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations to ban bump stocks and other devices that turn semiautomatic firearms into “machine guns.” A bump stock was used by the shooter who opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas in October, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds of others. That massacre immediately prompted calls for lawmakers or the administration to ban such devices through legislation or regulations, but efforts to pass a ban stalled in Congress.
In an appearance Thursday morning on Fox News, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said none of the ideas floated during Thursday’s meeting has been finalized and she criticized reports focusing on arming teachers.
“To focus on that alone today is disingenuously covering the fuller discussion yesterday, and frankly, it’s disrespectful to the people who were in that room raising any number of different issues,” Conway said.
I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
A Washington Post-ABC poll published this week found that 51 percent of Americans said the school shooting in Parkland “could not have been prevented” by allowing schoolteachers to carry guns, while 42 percent said it could have been prevented.
A larger majority, 58 percent, said stricter gun-control laws could have prevented the event, and 77 percent said better mental health screening and treatment could have thwarted it.
Trump has offered no details on how a program of arming teachers would work, how much it would cost and how school districts already strapped for cash would fund it. The Education Department estimates there are 3.1 million public school teachers and 400,000 private-school teachers. Arming 20 percent of teachers would mean arming more than 700,000 people. (There were about 1.3 million active-duty U.S. military personnel in 2016.)
In Thursday's listening session, Trump called his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, a “tough cookie” and told participants that if Kelly were his teacher, he would want Kelly to have a gun.
Speaking to reporters afterward, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R), one of the participants, said there is a need for more protection of students in schools.
“If teachers are armed … they must be highly trained, highly qualified or acting like air marshals, in a capacity like that — former police, former military, coming in in some capacity like that, where they are extremely qualified,” Bondi said. “Not just giving every teacher in school a handgun to carry. I don’t believe that’s going to happen. I don’t think anyone wants that to happen.”
The idea of arming teachers is not a new one for Trump, who often responds to mass shootings by proposing an increase in the number of law-abiding citizens who carry firearms and can stop a shooter.
In July 2015, following a shooting at a military recruitment center in Tennessee that left four Marines dead, Trump tweeted in all caps: “MILITARY LIVES MATTER! END GUN FREE ZONES! OUR SOLDIERS MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES! THIS HAS TO STOP!”
In November 2015, after terrorist attacks in and near Paris that left 130 people dead, Trump criticized the city for having “the toughest gun laws in the world.”
“Nobody had guns but the bad guys. Nobody had guns. Nobody,” Trump said at the time at a campaign rally.
In December 2015, after a mass shooting in Southern California that left 14 dead, Trump told reporters in Iowa the victims of the shooting “could've protected themselves if they had guns.”
“If you look at what happened in California, they didn't have guns, and they were slaughtered,” Trump said.
In January 2016, Trump said at a campaign rally in Vermont that he wants to eliminate gun-free zones at schools.
“I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases,” Trump said, to scattered cheers. “My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.”
In June 2016, after a mass shooting at a Florida nightclub, Trump said, “It's too bad some of the people killed over the weekend didn’t have guns attached to their hips, where bullets could have thrown in the opposite direction.” He said “had people been able to fire back, it would have been a much different outcome.”
“If some of those wonderful people had guns strapped right here — right to their waist or right to their ankle — and one of the people in that room happened to have it and goes 'boom, boom,' you know, that would have been a beautiful sight, folks,” Trump said in a radio interview at the time.
At the time, even leaders of the NRA said arming drunk clubgoers was a bad idea. Trump then clarified his comment and said he “was obviously talking about additional guards or employees.”", politics

Andrew Pollack, who lost his daughter in the Florida shooting, was a guest at a listening session at the White House.
WASHINGTON — An anguished father mourning his 18-year-old daughter vented his anger and pleaded for safer schools.
A fear-stricken student who watched classmates die last week wept openly as he called for banning assault weapons.
A mother who lost her 6-year-old son in a school shooting just over five years ago warned that more parents would lose their children if President Trump did not act, adding, “Don’t let that happen on your watch.”
One by one at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, survivors of school shootings and family members of victims shared their stories and their calls to action. The extraordinary public exchange with the president gave voice to an intensely emotional debate over how to respond to the latest gun massacre in an American school.

A week after a gunman opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and prompting a rash of student-driven lobbying for new gun restrictions, Mr. Trump met for more than an hour with grieving people in search of solutions. News cameras captured the unusual listening session, revealing an emotional give-and-take between a president and private citizens that is typically shielded from public view.

Mr. Trump used the event to pitch his own ideas about how to prevent such debacles in the future, polling the group about whether they supported allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons, an idea he said could have halted the carnage in Parkland.
“That coach was very brave, saved a lot of lives, I suspect,” Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to Aaron Feis, a coach at Stoneman Douglas who reportedly died using his body as a shield to protect students. “But if he had a firearm, he wouldn’t have had to run, he would have shot and that would have been the end of it.”
At a listening session with grieving parents and school-shooting victims, including students from Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, President Trump suggested teachers should be allowed to carry firearms.
Mr. Trump said he would press to strengthen background checks for people buying guns and press for enhanced mental health measures. “We’re going to go very strongly into age — age of purchase,” he added, appearing to refer to a proposal to set an age threshold for buying certain weapons, including the AR-15.
But in a session that began as a subdued conversation and sometimes descended into tears and shouting, policy proposals were overshadowed by raw expressions of fear, anger and sorrow.
“We’re here because my daughter has no voice — she was murdered last week, and she was taken from us, shot nine times,” said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was one of the 17 killed in Parkland. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here, with this administration and me, because I’m not going to sleep until it’s fixed.”
Most of the students and parents invited from the Florida school appeared to support Mr. Trump, many of them prefacing their comments with praise for his leadership. But even fans of the president vented anger and desperation, laying the challenge of responding to the tragedy at his feet.
“It should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it — and I’m pissed,” said Mr. Pollack, the only parent of a child killed in Parkland who was at the session, raising his voice as he looked at Mr. Trump. “Because my daughter, I’m not going to see again.”

Samuel Zeif, 18, told of texting his parents and brothers from the second floor of Stoneman Douglas, believing that he would be killed, and he dissolved into tears as he begged the president, “Let’s never let this happen again — please, please.”
“I don’t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an A-R,” Mr. Zeif said, referring to the AR-15 rifle. “How is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How do we not stop this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook? I’m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It’s still happening.”
Mr. Trump, who has often struggled to express empathy in the face of tragedy, appeared moved by the personal stories, even as he asked repeatedly whether anyone in the ornate room at the White House knew how such horrors could be prevented.
“I know you’ve been through a lot — most of you have been through a lot more than you ever thought possible,” Mr. Trump said, seated in a circle with students and parents. “All I can say is that we’re fighting hard for you, and we will not stop.”
“I grieve for you,” Mr. Trump added. “To me, there could be nothing worse than what you’ve gone through.”
During the session, Mr. Trump held a card that appeared to remind him of the basics of compassion when dealing with grieving survivors. “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” read one handwritten note on the card, captured in photographs of the event. “I hear you,” read another.
Mr. Pollack said he did not favor adopting new gun restrictions, but pleaded for Democrats and Republicans to come together to create new school safety measures.
“It’s not about gun laws right now — that’s another fight, another battle,” he said. “We need our children safe.”

Yet the subtext of the discussion was a contentious debate over gun restrictions and an all-too-familiar cycle of outrage, activism and promises of action, and then the inevitable inertia of Washington because of the opposition by the National Rifle Association and its allies.

Mr. Trump, a strident defender of gun rights who ran for office with the strong backing of the N.R.A., has come under immense pressure to endorse new gun limits after the Parkland massacre. The mass shooting has prompted a wave of youth activism that has reverberated from South Florida to Washington, where hundreds of students gathered outside the White House gates on Wednesday before the listening session, chanting, “Enough is enough!” and, “Hands up! — Don’t shoot!”
Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, said it was futile to believe Congress would act on new policies.
“We tried this legislative approach,” said Mr. Barden, a founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit advocacy group created after the massacre. “I’ve been in this building before many times, wringing our hands, pleading with legislators — ‘What can we do?’ — until we finally said we have to go home and do this ourselves.”
He and Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook, pressed Mr. Trump to consider prevention programs that train schools and educators to identify students in crisis and intervene before they attempt to harm themselves or others.
“Rather than arm them with a firearm,” Ms. Hockley said of teachers, “I would rather arm them with the knowledge of how to prevent these acts from happening in the first place.”
One of Mr. Pollack’s sons, Hunter, said he would prefer that educators carried weapons, arguing that more firearms on campus would lead to safer schools.
Yet it was the emotional appeals that appeared to have more influence on Mr. Trump.
Mr. Barden pulled out a photograph of his son showing a gaptoothed grin.
Mr. Pollack spoke movingly of “my beautiful daughter I’m never going to see again.”
Ms. Hockley implored the president not to allow another massacre of children on his watch, saying: “Consider your own children. You don’t want to be me — no parent does.”

As he ended the session, Mr. Trump promised their stories would not go unheard or unaddressed.
“Thank you for pouring out your hearts,” he said. “Because the world is watching, and we’re going to come up with a solution.”
