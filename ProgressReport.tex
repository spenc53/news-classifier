  \begin{itemize}
    \item A description of the problem
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The problem that we are solving is allowing machine learning algorithms to take news 
        articles and identify the topics of them. This is applicable to sites that suggest articles 
        for users to read. For example, google will suggest articles for their users based on articles 
        that they have read in the past. By using classification, google would be able to suggest 
        articles that are of the same topic as to what a user has read before.
      \end{itemize}
    \item What machine learning model we are initially trying to learn with
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The machine learning algorithms we are planning on using include Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Subject 
        Vector Machines, and Grid Search. All of these learning algorithms can be applied to text 
        classification. We plan on training on all three to see which one gives the best overall accuracy 
        and then, optimizing the chosen machine learning algorithm.
      \end{itemize}
    \item How and from where we are gathering data
      \begin{itemize}
        \item We will be gathering data from many different news websites, including 
        www.washingtonpost.com and www.cnn.com. To get this data, we will have to manually identify 
        website articles and their classification by hand. After this is done,  a simple python script 
        will fetch the article and store it as “article text, classification” in a CSV. Below is an 
        instance of our data.
      \end{itemize}
    \item A description of our data set including:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Actual example instances, including a reasonable representation (continuous, nominal, etc.) and values for each feature
          \begin{itemize}
            \item
            \begin{tabular}{|cc|}
              \hline
              Article                                                           & Classification\\
              \hline
              “Like the Huawei Mate 10 Pro that we reviewed earlier this week…” & Technology\\
              “President Trump on Thursday doubled down on his idea...”         & Political\\
              \hline
            \end{tabular}
          \end{itemize}
        \item How many instances and features we plan to have in our final data set
          \begin{itemize}
            \item 
            We hope to have 400 instances to train and test on. The features that we will have will 
            differ from what our original dataset contains. This is because we will need to transform it 
            into a different form before handing it to our Machine Learning Algorithm. The text from the 
            articles will be passed to Sklearn which will use Bucket of Words to obtain word counts for 
            each article. This data will then be used for training the data on. This means that as we 
            gather more articles, the final set of features will change due to the inclusion of new 
            words from different articles. Below is an example of what the the Machine Learning algorithm 
            will actually use to train.
